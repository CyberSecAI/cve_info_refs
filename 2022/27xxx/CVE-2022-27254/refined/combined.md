You don’t know how it happened, but you’re stuck staring at your locked car door, keys nowhere to be found. This can be a costly mistake, especially if you need to call a professional locksmith. However, depending on your car’s make, model and year, you might be able to use a slim jim to open it. A slim jim is a strip of metal with a notched end that can pop open older, upright locks on car doors. In this article, we’ll show you how to determine whether your car has the right locks for a slim jim and use it to get back on the road in a flash.

## How do you use a slim jim?

Insert a rubber wedge between the car door window and its weather stripping on the passenger side near the lock. Slide the notched end of the slim jim into the gap slowly until you notice the upright lock start to move subtly (this means you’ve hooked it). Slowly pull the slim jim straight up to unlock the car.

### How to Tell if a Slim Jim Will Work on Your Car

1. [![Step 1 Make sure your car doesn’t have electric locks.]()

   ![Step 1 Make sure your car doesn’t have electric locks.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0f/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-1-Version-6.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-1-Version-6.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-1-Version-6.jpg)
   1
   **Make sure your car doesn’t have electric locks.** Trying to use a [slim jim](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=slim+jim+car+door+opener&crid=2WLY9GFJW523D&sprefix=slim+jim%2Caps%2C242&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_8&tag=wikihow171759-20) on electric or power locks will do nothing but possibly scratch your window and damage the electronics in your car door. There might be other ways to [unlock the door](/Break-Into-a-Car "Break Into a Car"), but don’t try using a slim jim.
2. [![Step 2 Ensure your car has upright locks.]()

   ![Step 2 Ensure your car has upright locks.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4e/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-2-Version-6.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-2-Version-6.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-2-Version-6.jpg)
   2
   **Ensure your car has upright locks.** These locks look like small cylinders and are found near the bottom of the car window, where it meets the door. Note that these mechanical locks are usually found on cars manufactured in 1992 or before. If your car was made afterwards, it might still have these locks, but the car door may have electronics, wires or even airbags that make using a slim jim more difficult.[[1]](#_note-1)
   X
   Research source
   * If you’re unsure what locks are on your car, you should consult the user’s manual, or try researching your car model online.
   * Newer cars have complex electric power locks and lock shields or shrouding that block slim jims and other break-in tools, making them ineffective.[[2]](#_note-2)

3. [![Step 3 Call a locksmith if you’re still unsure.]()

   ![Step 3 Call a locksmith if you’re still unsure.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/a/aa/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-3-Version-7.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-3-Version-7.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-3-Version-7.jpg)
   3
   **Call a locksmith if you’re still unsure.** If it’s not obvious whether your car has the right locks for a slim jim, you should strongly consider calling a locksmith. Using a slim jim on the wrong type of locks could seriously damage your car. A locksmith might seem expensive, but the repairs on your car could be moreso.
   * Professional locksmith Robert Vallelunga recommends calling a pro. “You can go it alone, but you risk damaging the car lock, car door, or door seal, which will ultimately cost you more than hiring a professional to begin with. Every car model has a preferred way of opening, and they can be very different.”
   * He adds, “For older cars, with proof of ownership, a locksmith shop can just make you a key that will unlock the door by [using the car’s VIN](/Find-Your-VIN-%28Vehicle-Identification-Number%29 "Find Your VIN (Vehicle Identification Number)"). Even if the key isn’t programmed to the car, it will unlock the door so you can get your working keys out.”

1. [![Step 1 Approach the car’s passenger side door.]()

   ![Step 1 Approach the car’s passenger side door.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/ef/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-4-Version-6.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-4-Version-6.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-4-Version-6.jpg)
   1
   **Approach the car’s passenger side door.** It seems natural to want to open the driver’s side door; after all, this is where you typically enter the car. However, professional locksmiths typically try opening the passenger side door.[[3]](#_note-5)
   X
   Research source That way, if you make a mistake and damage the door’s mechanism, it won’t be the door you use most.
2. [![Step 2 Insert a wedge between the car window and weather stripping.]()

   ![Step 2 Insert a wedge between the car window and weather stripping.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/44/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-5-Version-6.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-5-Version-6.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-5-Version-6.jpg)
   2
   **Insert a wedge between the car window and weather stripping.** The weatherstrip is the rubber strip running between the car door and window.[[4]](#_note-6)
   X
   Research source This will create the space you need to insert the slim jim. You can get a [wedge specifically designed for opening car locks](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=car+unlock+wedge&crid=3KYE691703RH8&sprefix=wedge+to+unlo%2Caps%2C111&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_2_13&tag=wikihow171759-20), but they’re typically not much different than a door wedge. Ideally, use a rubber wedge, as a wooden wedge could leave splinters and shards in your car door.
3. [![Step 3 Slide the slim jim in the space made by the wedge.]()

   ![Step 3 Slide the slim jim in the space made by the wedge.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/3/38/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-6-Version-6.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-6-Version-6.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-6-Version-6.jpg)
   3
   **Slide the slim jim in the space made by the wedge.** Slide the notched end first, in towards the car lock. Align the slim jim with the lock, pushing down towards the keyhole, which is usually located at the rear of the door. Insert the slim jim slowly, making sure not to catch on anything on the way down.[[5]](#_note-7)

   4
   **Watch the lock for subtle movement.** You’ll know the slim jim has caught on the locking mechanism if the lock starts moving slightly. Make sure to keep the slim jim completely vertical, to avoid catching on any other mechanisms.[[6]](#_note-8)
   X
   Research source
5. [![Step 5 Pull the slim jim upwards slowly until the door unlocks.]()

   ![Step 5 Pull the slim jim upwards slowly until the door unlocks.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/8f/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-8-Version-2.jpg)
   5
   **Pull the slim jim upwards slowly until the door unlocks.** If you’ve latched onto the locking mechanism, the lock should move upwards as you move the slim jim. Keep your motion slow and smooth to avoid causing any undue damage.[[7]](#_note-9)
   X
   Research source Remove the slim jim and you’ll be able to open the car door.
6. [![Step 6 Avoid making multiple attempts to open the door.]()

   ![Step 6 Avoid making multiple attempts to open the door.](https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/66/Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-460px-Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)](#/Image:Use-a-Slim-Jim-Step-9-Version-2.jpg)
   6
   **Avoid making multiple attempts to open the door.** If you can’t get the door unlocked after one or two attempts, it’s best to stop before you cause any damage to it. Unlocking a locked door is a very technical skill; don’t feel bad if you’re not able to get it open. Get a professional to open your car door and call a locksmith.[[8]](#_note-10)

  The security system might prevent you from doing so. Try a long reach tool instead and go for the unlock.

  Slim Jims work on upright car locks. For the locks in this car, you may need to look at alternate options.

* If a slim jim won’t work on your car, opt for a [professional opening kit](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=car+unlock+kit&crid=1QEUDGYRM2ROC&sprefix=car+un%2Caps%2C130&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_6&tag=wikihow171759-20) with a [long reach tool](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=long+reach+tool+car+lockout&crid=21OE4IYE9NJ1Q&sprefix=long+rea%2Caps%2C135&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_8&tag=wikihow171759-20). Vallelunga says, “Professional opening kits are available online and can be purchased by anyone, but most require training to be effective. The most valuable tool in one of those kits is a long reach tool. Long reach tools are slid in the crack between where the door and the roof of the car meet. You grab the door handle on the opposite side of the car, and pull it to release the door.”

[Article SummaryX](#summary_wrapper)

You may be able to use a slim jim to open your car if your car locks are small, upright cylinders near the bottom of the car window, and your car does not have electronic locks. If this is the case, insert a wedge between the car window and the weather stripping, then slide the slim jim in the space made by the wedge, notched end first. Align the slim jim with the lock and push it down toward the keyhole. When you see the lock start to move, pull the slim jim upward slowly until the door unlocks. Keep reading to learn when you should call a locksmith!

# Honda bug lets a hacker unlock and start your car via replay attack

Researchers have disclosed a 'replay attack' vulnerability affecting select Honda and Acura car models, that allows a nearby hacker to unlock your car and even start its engine from a short distance.

The attack consists of a threat actor capturing the RF signals sent from your key fob to the car and resending these signals to take control of your car's remote keyless entry system.

The vulnerability, according to researchers, remains largely unfixed in older models. But Honda owners may be able to take some action to protect themselves against this attack.

## From wireless unlocking to keyless engine start

This week, multiple researchers disclosed a vulnerability that can be used by a nearby attacker to unlock some Honda and Acura car models, and start their engines wirelessly.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-27254, is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack or more specifically a replay attack in which an attacker intercepts the RF signals normally sent from a remote key fob to the car, manipulates these signals, and re-sends these at a later time to unlock the car at will.

A [video](https://github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254) shared by the researchers also demonstrates the remote engine start aspect of the flaw—although no technical details or proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code were shared at this time:

The researchers credited with discovering the vulnerability are computer scientist [Blake Berry](https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/), and researcher [Ayyappan Rajesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayyappan-rajesh/).

According to researchers, the vehicles impacted by this bug primarily include the 2016-2020 Honda Civic (LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, Type R) cars.

In a GitHub repository, Berry shared that it was also possible to manipulate the captured commands and re-transmit them to achieve a different outcome altogether.

For example, in one of his [tests](http://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty), Berry recorded the "lock" command sent by the key fob, which consisted of the following bits.

653-656, 667-668, 677-680, 683-684, 823-826, 837-838, 847-850, 853-854

Berry then "flipped" and re-sent these bits to the vehicle, that in turn had the effect of unlocking the vehicle.

This isn't the first time that such a flaw has been reported in cars either.

In 2020, Berry had reported a similar flaw (CVE-2019-20626) affecting the following Honda and Acura models but alleged that Honda ignored his report and "continued to implement 0 security measures against this very simple 'replay/replay and edit' attack."

* 2009 Acura TSX
* 2016 Honda Accord V6 Touring Sedan
* 2017 Honda HR-V (CVE-2019-20626)
* 2018 Honda Civic Hatchback
* 2020 Honda Civic LX

The researchers' recommendation for the vehicle manufacturers is that they implement 'rolling codes,' also known as hopping codes. This security technology provides fresh codes for each authentication request, and as such these codes cannot be 'replayed' by an attacker at a later time.

In January 2022, researcher *Kevin2600* had also disclosed a similar vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2021-46145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-46145), but [mentioned](http://tiger-team-1337.blogspot.com/2022/01/honda-civic-keyfob-system-affected-by.html) that the particular keyless system used rolling codes, therefore making the attack far less effective:

> So plus the one [CVE-2021-46145] I found a few months ago, we now have at least 3 CVEs related to Honda <https://t.co/HoVahGCbtA> Well done! [@Honda](https://twitter.com/Honda?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) :p

## Honda has 'no plan' to update older models

To better understand the impact of this vulnerability and Honda's plans to address the flaw, BleepingComputer reached out to Honda.

Honda told us, multiple automakers use legacy technology for implementing remote lock-unlock functionality, and as such may be vulnerable to "determined and very technologically sophisticated thieves."

"At this time, it appears that the devices only appear to work within close proximity or while physically attached to the target vehicle, requiring local reception of radio signals from the vehicle owner's key fob when the vehicle is opened and started nearby," a Honda spokesperson told BleepingComputer.

Note, in their statement to us, Honda explicitly mentions it has not verified the information reported by the researchers and cannot confirm if Honda's vehicles are actually vulnerable to this type of attack.

But should the vehicles be vulnerable, "Honda has no plan to update older vehicles at this time," the company tells BleepingComputer.

"It's important to note, while Honda regularly improves security features as new models are introduced, determined and technologically sophisticated thieves are also working to overcome those features."

Further, the company argues that a nearby thief can use other means to access a vehicle, as opposed to relying on hi-tech hacks like these and there is no indication that the type of interception device in question is widely used. Although, the remote engine start aspect of the flaw remains problematic as it goes well beyond a simple door unlock hack.

The researchers suggest that consumers store their key fobs in signal-blocking 'Faraday pouches' when not in use, although that approach still won't protect against a determined attacker eavesdropping on signals when the fob is used.

Another suggestion made by the researchers is for consumers to opt for [Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) as opposed to Remote Keyless Entry (RKE)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Remote-keyless-entry-RKE), which would make it "significantly harder for an attacker to clone/read the signal due to the proximity they would need to be at to do so."

"If you believe that you are a victim of this attack, the only current mitigation is to reset your key fob at the dealership," conclude the researchers.

*Update March 26th, 01:48 AM ET: Credits for the vulnerability have been updated as requested by the researchers. An earlier version of the GitHub repository with the demo videos credited the researchers [differently](http://web.archive.org/web/20220325194331/https%3A//github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254/blob/main/README.md) but this was later [revised](http://github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254/commit/2d01cbc228e158deedd1c8e782deefc90f1fd165).*

  Maybe just use some sort of physical key, that you turn in a lock? Modern cars should give up on wireless locks.

# Unoriginal-Rice-Patty

*"Can you believe that a low-quality garage door has better security than a Honda?"*

*"Unoriginal-Rice-Patty" is my personal title for the Replay-based attack on Honda and Acura vehicles*
*"Honda" in Japanese translates to "Original Rice Patty". While a cute fact, this attack is not cute and not original, hence the name*

*This is for educational purposes only. I am in NO WAY liable for any actions executed by means of the contents within this repository. PLEASE use responsibly.*

This attack seems to affect EVERY Honda/Acura vehicle with remote/wireless radio entry. Honda does *NOT* ever institue a rolling code system and *ONLY* manufactures systems with static codes meaning there is NO layer of security.

## Summary:

A hacker can gain complete and unlimited access to locking, unlocking, controlling the windows, opening the trunk, and starting the engine of the target vehicle where the only way to prevent the attack is to either never use your fob or, after being compromised (which would be difficult to realize), resetting your fob at a dealership.

## The Attack:

Simply capturing the signal sent from a FOB is enough to gain at least *some* control of the vehicle. If the target locks their vehicle, all it takes is
receiving it and saving it for me to gain the ability to replay the same command and have the vehicle respond accordingly.

Recording the "unlock" command from the target and replaying (this works on most if not all of Honda's produced FOBs) will allow me to unlock the vehicle whenever I'd like to, and it doesn't stop there *at all*
On top of being able to start the vehicle's *ENGINE* *Whenever I wished* through recording the "remote start", it seems possible to actually (through Honda's "Smart Key" which uses FSK) demodulate any command, edit it, and retransmit in order to make the target vehicle do whatever you wish.

For Example:
Recording a "lock" command and flipping the following bits:

`653-656, 667-668, 677-680, 683-684, 823-826, 837-838, 847-850, 853-854`

will tell the vehicle to unlock (These numbers include the preamble)

I discovered this while analyzing the codes with my published Python script, "DiffBits" which is based on Samy Kamkars Perl script of the same name.

Here is the comparison of two "unlock" keys (no preamble):
[![unlock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43358273/127954845-8e1503fd-2be6-4378-a452-96cd5b6c98b0.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43358273/127954845-8e1503fd-2be6-4378-a452-96cd5b6c98b0.png)

Here is the comparison of two "lock" keys (no preamble):
[![lock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43358273/127954862-3c6cd120-b9fe-43a9-955b-97c22e5d81e7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43358273/127954862-3c6cd120-b9fe-43a9-955b-97c22e5d81e7.png)

Here is the comparison of one unlock, and one lock key (no preamble):
[![both](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43358273/127954890-bcd52cff-3782-4c3c-b1f5-4d926b1b56a5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43358273/127954890-bcd52cff-3782-4c3c-b1f5-4d926b1b56a5.png)

The red text indicates a change in bits. Some can be written off as simple errors in processing the codes, however some are very clearly indicating
what action the vehicle must perform.

(Codes processed with [URH](https://github.com/jopohl/urh) and were provided by [REDACTED]. Thanks, [REDACTED]!)

## *CONFIRMED* Vehicles (despite the fact that this likely affects them all):

• 2009 Acura TSX

• 2016 Honda Accord V6 Touring Sedan

• 2017 Honda HR-V (CVE-2019-20626)

• 2018 Honda Civic Hatchback

• 2020 Honda Civic LX

## The Interesting Part

Honda seemingly ignored [CVE-2019-20626](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20626) (cited above in the list of confirmed, affected vehicles). They continued to implement 0 security measures against
this very simple "replay/replay and edit" attack. This CVE interestingly only cites one vehicle and I only discovered this much later in my pursuit for
research. Honda will not respond to me, or seemingly anyone attempting to report this security MAJOR flaw.

## How Honda Can Fix This

Honda must implement a "rolling code" system into their vehicles' list of security measures. Rolling code systems have been around since 1995 and
work very well against hackers. Honda has seemingly never implemented this security measure, leaving them very far behind in the race toward a secure
technological future. As far as I can tell, this isn't easily "patchable". Honda can begin to implement security measures in future vehicles, however
it doesn't seem likely that they will go back and fix this security issue in older models.

## Epilogue

I am very interested in community feedback! Feel free to contact me with more research, information, or questions!

[00:04] [Music]
[00:20] hi everyone thanks for coming uh I'm
[00:23] Sammy and this is drive it like you
[00:26] hacked it um this is a basically a fun
[00:28] talk i' I've just been continuously
[00:29] working on and improving um as I'm doing
[00:31] research in a couple of different areas
[00:33] um a couple really fun areas for me have
[00:36] been uh vehicles um Vehicles radio
[00:40] hardware and uh we're going to focus a
[00:43] little bit on some of that stuff which
[00:44] is really fun to me um we'll cover some
[00:46] web stuff as well and try to bring it
[00:48] all together in a fun way
[00:50] so we all love Nicholas Cage right yeah
[00:53] okay I love Nicholas Cage so I saw Gone
[00:56] in 60 seconds it's like one of my
[00:57] favorite movies so I've spent my entire
[00:59] life trying to be like him um so as Gone
[01:03] in 60 Seconds happens you know basically
[01:06] Nick Cage is going around stealing cars
[01:08] I hope I didn't spoil that for anyone
[01:10] but uh to do that the first thing you
[01:12] need to do is you need to get into a
[01:14] garage which has like some really cool
[01:16] cars so in the last year I've been
[01:18] looking at how can I break into garages
[01:21] like how do garages work and garages uh
[01:23] are pretty cool we all have sort of
[01:26] we've all seen the clicker right little
[01:28] garage clicker all right I have one here
[01:31] so I started learning about how these
[01:33] things worked and my goal was to break
[01:35] into my own garage um I have like a I'm
[01:38] in a condo unit so there's a bunch of
[01:40] different cars down there and I wanted
[01:42] to see how this thing works so I started
[01:45] learning a little bit about radio
[01:46] frequency and how um radios and
[01:49] communicating with devices like garage
[01:51] door openers
[01:52] works so the first thing we're going to
[01:55] basically go in depth here and I'm going
[01:56] to show you how how this stuff works
[01:57] we'll actually do some live
[01:58] demonstrations um the first thing you do
[02:02] when learning about something with radio
[02:05] is there's something really cool any
[02:07] device in the US that transmits that
[02:09] actually transmits radio frequency has
[02:11] to have an FCC ID so if you actually
[02:13] pull out your phone all of our phones
[02:15] actually will have an FCC ID on the back
[02:17] here so like on my iPhone I I see an FCC
[02:19] ID so same thing with this garage door
[02:21] opener which opens my garage so what we
[02:24] can do is we can actually take one of
[02:25] these things and open up our
[02:27] garage um and if we look at the FC C ID
[02:30] the cool thing about the FCC is what
[02:32] they do is they regulate uh Transmission
[02:34] in the US so if you want to transmit on
[02:36] a radio frequency the FCC has to allow
[02:38] that device or manufacturer to do it um
[02:41] and what we can do is all of the
[02:43] information about that ID is actually
[02:45] public information so you can actually
[02:47] go to the fcc's website which is really
[02:49] really hard to use um and search for one
[02:52] of these IDs fortunately someone named
[02:54] Dominic spill has created a website
[02:56] called fcc.io which I use all the time
[02:59] and basically on fcc.io you can just
[03:01] typee in the identifier back on either
[03:04] this garage door opener or your garage
[03:06] door itself or your phone so if you
[03:09] actually pull out your phone and you can
[03:10] look up the FCC ID and you can learn all
[03:12] about what your phone transmits on it's
[03:14] actually very cool um and inside of
[03:18] there we'll see a few things so the
[03:19] first thing we see is uh often you'll
[03:22] see pictures of the actual device both
[03:24] the outside on the left here and the
[03:26] inside so you'll actually see inside of
[03:28] that circuit um this is really cool if
[03:30] you're trying to look up information on
[03:31] say a device that you don't necessarily
[03:33] have access to or a device that might be
[03:35] out of your price range or uh a device
[03:38] that's not released yet right something
[03:39] that's coming out you can actually go
[03:41] here and you can learn a ton of
[03:42] information you could probably produce
[03:44] you know vulner you can probably
[03:46] discover vulnerabilities or issues with
[03:47] the device before it even comes out it's
[03:50] pretty
[03:51] incredible so here's an example of
[03:53] actually my garage door door opener I
[03:55] looked it up and the first thing we see
[03:57] here is we see kind of like where it
[03:59] came from it came from China obviously
[04:02] um and you also see the the range here
[04:04] the frequency range so this is the
[04:05] frequency that it communicates on and on
[04:08] this one it says the lower frequency is
[04:09] 390 MHz and the upper is 390 MHz so that
[04:13] means this communicates on one one
[04:14] frequency 390 MHz which is pretty cool
[04:17] um so what else we see on on the FCC we
[04:20] see stuff like uh they have a cover
[04:22] letter always a nice little formal
[04:24] letter they write um external photos
[04:26] like we saw internal photos couple
[04:29] different
[04:30] things one of the the more interesting
[04:32] areas is the um the test report so what
[04:36] the FCC does is they hire someone to
[04:38] come out and actually test your device
[04:40] because the thing with the with
[04:42] frequencies is we're essentially sharing
[04:44] the Spectrum like you don't want a
[04:45] device to just constantly transmit out
[04:47] and prevent other devices from working
[04:49] for example if I just held this garage
[04:51] door thing if this were just
[04:52] transmitting all the time it may prevent
[04:54] other garage door uh openers from
[04:56] working um and you wouldn't want to
[04:58] interfere with say someone across the
[05:01] street so they do all these tests to
[05:03] ensure that it transmits on the
[05:04] frequencies it's allowed to not more
[05:06] powerful than it should uh so on and so
[05:08] forth so if we pull this up we can see
[05:10] like the internal report we can actually
[05:12] often see um a a spectr graph of
[05:16] actually recording of that uh of the
[05:18] radio signal transmitted by the
[05:21] device and there are some different
[05:23] devices I use to actually uh listen to
[05:26] this kind of stuff one of the devices
[05:28] really cool um it's hack RF uh it's
[05:30] capable of receiving and trans
[05:32] transmitting from 1 MHz all the way up
[05:34] to 6 GHz really wide range totally open
[05:37] source open Hardware couple hundred
[05:39] dollars um it can also transmit which is
[05:41] really interesting people have done some
[05:43] really crazy stuff with this thing uh
[05:45] for example spoofing GPS I mean people
[05:48] have literally spoofed GPS using this
[05:50] device or similar devices and have made
[05:52] ships go off course ships literally
[05:55] going off course because what are they
[05:56] depending on they're depending on GPS
[05:58] how's the GPS work it's from radio
[06:00] signals getting sent from satellites
[06:02] down to the Earth and we're using that
[06:03] to like figure out where we are and
[06:05] someone comes along and transmits a
[06:06] signal and you think you're somewhere
[06:07] else or you think you're just going
[06:09] somewhere else I mean the the amount of
[06:11] dependency that we have on these radio
[06:13] signals is massive and it's growing
[06:15] every single day so this is another
[06:17] reason that this is like such an
[06:18] interesting thing and and I'm so
[06:20] interested in this right now and now
[06:22] hacker F you may say okay well I don't
[06:24] know anything about radio and I know
[06:26] very little about radio personally but
[06:28] uh you can do some pretty simple things
[06:31] for example if you're dealing with
[06:32] something that uses a fixed transmission
[06:35] um something that where it's like a
[06:37] password so if you open your garage door
[06:39] opener a lot of our garage door openers
[06:40] basically have a bunch of dip switches
[06:42] which is essentially a password and that
[06:44] opens your garage now if you don't know
[06:46] someone's like if I were trying to
[06:47] exploit someone's garage and trying to
[06:49] break in what I might do is I might um
[06:52] record that signal and replay it and
[06:54] hacker F can do that now not all devices
[06:57] are capable of recording and replaying
[06:59] uh often you need to know a lot more
[07:01] information about the signal which we'll
[07:02] learn in a bit but with literally two
[07:04] commands you can record and then replay
[07:06] kind of like recording a you know taking
[07:08] a microphone and a speaker um and re
[07:10] reproducing some signal now this will
[07:12] work in some scenarios not in all
[07:14] scenarios for example cars we'll use
[07:16] something called rolling codes we'll go
[07:17] over that later where the password's
[07:19] changing kind of like uh Google
[07:21] Authenticator or TFA right you might get
[07:24] uh a tofa is essentially a rolling code
[07:26] where every time you get a new
[07:27] identifier or a new password to log into
[07:30] something another device I use is rtlsdr
[07:33] this thing's awesome I have it right
[07:35] here um it's basically uh another
[07:38] antenna it's a soft SDR means software
[07:40] Divine radio um RTL it's from realtech
[07:43] and software divined radio is well
[07:45] hacker f is also a software defined
[07:46] radio it allows you to use software and
[07:49] inexpensive Hardware to analyze the
[07:52] radio spectrum and also often transmit
[07:54] rtlsdr is great because it's like $20 on
[07:57] Amazon so you can go right now for 20
[07:59] bucks get into it you know start
[08:01] learning um and you can do so much you
[08:03] can see planes going overhead there's
[08:06] actually uh someone in La who did who
[08:08] has been recording planes so it's public
[08:11] transmission whenever a plane is flying
[08:13] it's sending radio signal of where it is
[08:15] of its GPS coordinates and information
[08:17] about it um its unique name and he
[08:20] started mapping it out just as a hobby
[08:22] and he found that there's these planes
[08:24] that are just circling over La they're
[08:27] just going in circles right they lift
[08:28] off they fly around and then they Circle
[08:32] why are their planes circling over LA
[08:34] and he started look what's
[08:35] that correct FBI planes he's a guy who
[08:38] discovered that these are FBI planes
[08:40] going around probably using something
[08:42] like Stingray to listen to our phone
[08:44] calls and text messages um so always say
[08:47] high FBI when you pick up the phone
[08:50] um so rtlsdr is another really cool
[08:53] example he did that with rtlsdr it's a
[08:55] $20 device you can use free software
[08:57] open source software on your computer
[08:59] computer no matter you know in any major
[09:00] operating system um G new radio this is
[09:03] like a this is a fun although
[09:05] complicated piece of software um that
[09:09] it's probably not complicated it's just
[09:10] really hard for me to learn um so I'm
[09:12] still trying to figure out how to use
[09:13] this thing but it allows you to take
[09:14] radio signals or actually any signal
[09:16] technically you can just pipe audio into
[09:18] it and you can manipulate it you can run
[09:20] different filters on it and extract
[09:22] information or transmit information so
[09:24] this is another really useful
[09:26] tool um gqrx this is an awesome tool
[09:29] we'll actually use this in a minute uh
[09:30] I'll show you how it works basically
[09:32] this allows us to see a waterfall view
[09:34] of the spectrum of the radio spectrum so
[09:36] we can say all right I want to see from
[09:39] 300 to 301 MHz I want to see everything
[09:41] that happens on there um this would
[09:43] allow you to make let's say you have a
[09:45] device and you don't have the FCC ID or
[09:47] let's say you don't have access to a
[09:49] device let's say you're outside of
[09:50] something and you have a black box or
[09:53] you know someone's driving up to their
[09:55] garage and they're about to hit a button
[09:56] but you don't know what frequency their
[09:57] device is using you can can use this to
[09:59] essentially watch watch a waterfall of
[10:02] radio frequencies and you will see when
[10:04] there is something with a high amplitude
[10:06] when there is essentially a signal
[10:07] that's getting transmitted it's really
[10:08] cool um this is for Linux and OSX only
[10:12] uh if you're on Windows you can also get
[10:13] sdrsharp it's another uh similar tool to
[10:16] do the same thing very cool um and the
[10:20] cool thing is I mean there are people
[10:21] out there like on Reddit there's a
[10:23] there's a subreddit called rtlsdr and
[10:25] you can actually go on there and people
[10:27] are just looking at the Spectrum because
[10:29] all these radio frequencies out there
[10:30] and we have no idea what a lot of them
[10:31] are right A lot of these you know this
[10:34] is this is something that's invisible
[10:36] right it's essentially invisible to us
[10:38] and um usually when there's something
[10:40] invisible like people just assume it's
[10:43] secure because we can't see it we don't
[10:44] know how it works and more and more
[10:46] people are now playing in this area and
[10:47] researching and trying to find what are
[10:49] all these invisible signals and a lot of
[10:51] it lacks security I mean it's it's
[10:53] really interesting some of the stuff
[10:54] that's coming out of here RTL FM um this
[10:57] is like a command line tool that allow
[10:59] allows you to record signals with the
[11:01] rtlsdr so these are some of the tools
[11:03] that I use um the presentation will be
[11:05] available uh online so if you guys want
[11:08] to grab it and and do any research in
[11:10] here you you'll you'll have access to
[11:11] all of that so let's go back to this FCC
[11:14] report um there are three things I
[11:16] usually look at when I'm looking at an
[11:18] FCC report for um for a device uh
[11:21] internal photos because that allows me
[11:23] to see inside if I can see inside I
[11:25] might be able to make out the chip
[11:26] that's being used uh if I look at the
[11:28] chip I can probably look up data sheets
[11:30] available for that chip and I can learn
[11:32] all about what the chip is doing the
[11:33] frequency it communicates on the
[11:35] modulation all sorts of information
[11:36] about it um I can look at the test
[11:38] report as well and the test report will
[11:41] will often provide some useful
[11:44] information such as what frequencies it
[11:46] uses perhaps what modulation um and then
[11:49] also the user manual there's always like
[11:51] incredible pieces of information in user
[11:53] manuals that I find uh a friend of me a
[11:55] friend of mine was at Coachella and he's
[11:56] like yeah I came back to my car and all
[11:58] my windows were were down um and I was
[12:00] like was anything stolen he's like no
[12:02] luckily they like well so he's like
[12:04] someone broke into my car and didn't
[12:05] take anything I was like H that seems
[12:07] weird so I looked up the FCC ID I was
[12:09] like maybe someone hacked his Dev his
[12:11] like radio thing uh or his his car key
[12:14] um and I looked it looked it up and I
[12:15] looked at the user manual and it's just
[12:17] a section of how the car key operates
[12:19] and everything about the car key and
[12:20] apparently if you hold one of the
[12:21] buttons down for enough seconds all of
[12:23] your windows just roll
[12:24] down
[12:26] um I haven't told him I'm going to use
[12:28] it against him
[12:30] so so here's an example of a test report
[12:33] from a from my garage door opener you
[12:35] can we can see something called the the
[12:37] frequency is 390 MHz we see the
[12:40] modulation type is ask or ask we'll go
[12:43] over that in a second here and a couple
[12:45] other things about the device um so
[12:47] let's talk about modulation a little
[12:49] bit uh who here has listened to the
[12:52] radio okay cool um younger people may
[12:56] not know what that is uh it's like
[12:59] Spotify um so we now have things there
[13:03] there's different types of modulation
[13:05] it's basically how we encode data in a
[13:07] signal there's ask which is amplitude
[13:10] shift keying there's FSK frequency shift
[13:13] keying and psk phase shift keing these
[13:15] are common modulation schemes that are
[13:16] used now these are specifically for
[13:19] Digital Data when you're trying to
[13:20] communicate digital information over uh
[13:23] over the radio spectrum now ask is
[13:26] actually a type of amplitude modulation
[13:28] amplitude modulation is am it's
[13:31] literally AM radio when you're listening
[13:32] to your AM radio your radio is taking
[13:35] the radio spectrum at Whatever frequency
[13:37] you're listening to um let's say 200 khz
[13:40] and it the amplitude which is
[13:42] essentially if you're listening to let's
[13:43] say a sound file right the amplitude is
[13:45] the volume it's essentially how strong
[13:47] that volume is the amplitude defines
[13:50] where what kind of sound you're hearing
[13:52] or what frequency the sound is at
[13:54] frequency shift keying is frequency
[13:56] modulation or FM so FM radio when you're
[13:59] listening to 102.7 you're actually
[14:01] listening to 102.7 MHz and we can use
[14:04] that we can see that in rtlsdr and the
[14:07] frequency is actually not 102.7 it's
[14:09] actually a range so it's actually more
[14:11] like 102.5 to 102.9 and the frequency
[14:14] changes depending on where uh you know
[14:18] what that sound what that frequency
[14:19] should be so in something like rtlsdr we
[14:22] can also if we don't know what uh device
[14:25] is transmitting we can look at it here
[14:27] and on the left we see that there's kind
[14:29] of like two signals coming whenever I
[14:32] hit a button so that's probably
[14:34] something called 2fk or frequency shift
[14:36] keying where the frequency is changing
[14:39] and because it's digital it's just ones
[14:40] or zeros so left or right means one or
[14:43] zero and then on the right we have ask
[14:45] which is amplitude shift ging where it's
[14:47] just either there's a signal or there's
[14:49] not a signal which represents a one or a
[14:51] zero so why don't we actually why don't
[14:54] we actually see what this looks like um
[14:57] I am going to open gqrx X and I'm going
[14:59] to use this rtlsdr just so we can take a
[15:01] quick look let's see if this works
[15:06] here all right so awesome so we can see
[15:11] here I'm at 300 MHz which is what this
[15:14] garage door opener is at and whenever I
[15:17] press we can see data so that's pretty
[15:20] cool like if if I didn't know what
[15:22] frequency it was at we could like go
[15:24] searching through you know we could go
[15:26] to let's say um here we have we have
[15:29] actual stations right so I'm at 100 MHz
[15:31] now so we can actually see FM radio
[15:32] stations and I could actually demodulate
[15:34] this data I let's see if that even works
[15:42] dmod so we'd have to
[15:47] tune oh
[15:49] yeah so we can actually tune to
[15:51] different stations
[15:55] here that's my jam right there all right
[15:57] cool
[15:59] um cool so we actually know that this is
[16:00] at 300 MHz now um this is really cool we
[16:03] can demodulate this data right in here
[16:05] um so now that we know it's at again
[16:08] we'll we'll look at it once more here
[16:11] 300 me yep 300 MHz and because it looks
[16:15] like it's just one signal going turning
[16:17] on and off that tells me it's probably
[16:19] amplitude shift keying or am amplitude
[16:21] modulation so we can then use rtfm so
[16:24] let me quit that uh let's see here find
[16:28] my
[16:29] windows all right so I mean that's going
[16:33] to be hard to see but here I'll just
[16:35] record it first so I'll
[16:36] say uh RTL 300 test. wve I'll press this
[16:41] once or twice great contrl C and what
[16:44] this actually does is this produces an
[16:47] audio file a wave file that we can then
[16:48] inspect so I'm going to pull this up in
[16:51] audacity a free audio tool uh let me
[16:55] find the file
[16:57] here and I'll will throw this in here
[16:59] all right cool so this is audacity so
[17:02] here we can see I click I hit it twice I
[17:04] hit it once here and then once here so
[17:06] let's take a look at what this signal
[17:07] actually looks like zoom in it looks
[17:10] like it's a repeating signal it looks
[17:12] like the same information now who is
[17:14] open one of these garage doors and had
[17:15] to like set the dip switches you had to
[17:17] do that all right so so we've seen those
[17:19] usually it's like 10 or 12 dip switches
[17:22] so let's zoom
[17:24] in can you guess what these relate
[17:27] to
[17:29] so if I open mine right here this thing
[17:31] is impossible to open all right no I got
[17:33] it I'll uh I'll tell you what I have
[17:37] here I have on and off dip switches mine
[17:40] is on on off on let's just zoom in so we
[17:44] can see if there's any correlation at
[17:46] all on on off on off on off off off off
[17:53] so basically we're seeing amplitude
[17:55] we're actually seeing a signal in this
[17:57] case it looks like a long signal
[17:58] followed by nothing long is a one and a
[18:02] short signal followed by nothing is a
[18:04] zero so literally just by using this $20
[18:08] device I've recorded and I now know the
[18:10] code to my garage door you could go
[18:13] around like recording code like just
[18:15] like in Gone in 60 Seconds right they go
[18:17] up to the garage they use their little
[18:19] device which probably didn't exist and
[18:21] they are able to record the code like
[18:23] that's so interesting all right so let's
[18:26] go back to uh oh man I can't see
[18:29] anything all
[18:32] right I like I like where he's going
[18:34] with that all right let's see if I can
[18:37] figure out how to open I can't I'm not
[18:39] mirroring here show all
[18:41] windows
[18:49] man
[18:51] enhance all
[18:53] right back to the
[18:55] slideshow Okay cool so we just just saw
[18:59] gqrx and we saw this right so we
[19:01] actually analyzed that signal we saw it
[19:03] was just a repeating signal it repeats a
[19:05] bunch of times because amplitude shift
[19:07] King like if you've ever listened to am
[19:09] the audio sucks audio quality sucks it's
[19:11] it's very easy to it's the most
[19:13] inexpensive way to transmit information
[19:16] um but it's also the most prone to
[19:18] interference um people sniffing you can
[19:21] really sniff anything though so someone
[19:24] had a good suggestion what if we brute
[19:27] force that um how long would it take
[19:29] well if we take a look at these
[19:30] different garage doors uh there's a
[19:32] couple different things um some are 8
[19:33] Bits some are 10 bits 12 bits uh right
[19:36] there's just on and off so I recorded
[19:38] this one and it looked like it was 2
[19:40] milliseconds per bit with a 2
[19:42] millisecond delay for each bit um and it
[19:45] sent five signals per transmission
[19:47] minimum so if we calculate that uh for
[19:49] all the possible garage doors that I've
[19:51] looked at that use fixed codes it looks
[19:53] like it would take about 29 29 and a
[19:55] half minutes to Brute Force so basically
[19:57] 30 minutes to root Force someone's
[19:59] garage which is pretty
[20:01] insane um so I was looking at this and I
[20:03] was like well can I do this a little
[20:05] faster because I have stuff to do I
[20:07] can't just sit outside of people's homes
[20:08] 30
[20:09] minutes and do this and uh I was looking
[20:14] and I saw okay well if it's repeating
[20:15] the signal what if we stop repeating the
[20:17] signal like it's repeating just so that
[20:19] it can be more successful but for the
[20:21] most most part we're not going to have
[20:23] interference so if we actually take out
[20:24] the repetition we can actually reduce it
[20:27] to 6 minutes to Brute Force any fixed
[20:29] code garage that's pretty cool but
[20:32] looking at this further I saw that there
[20:34] was basically this massive period of
[20:36] weight uh of delay between every time it
[20:39] sends a signal so I was curious what if
[20:41] I took out that delay where it's sending
[20:43] one signal followed by like one password
[20:45] followed by another password instead of
[20:47] a delay in between them what if I just
[20:48] sent password password password password
[20:50] and that worked it opened my garage so
[20:52] that reduced it down to 3 minutes to
[20:54] open any fix code
[20:57] garage and then I was thinking how does
[20:59] it know where one password begins and
[21:01] one password ends um what if it's using
[21:04] something called a bitshift register now
[21:06] a bit shift register is basically a
[21:08] register where you you pull in data one
[21:10] bit at a time and as it's essentially it
[21:13] performs a test let's say it's a
[21:14] four-bit register it looks at the four
[21:16] bits and it performs a test is this the
[21:18] correct four bit if not it then takes
[21:20] one bit off pops one off and then shifts
[21:22] one in well if that's the case you
[21:25] wouldn't actually need to test all
[21:27] possible codes you could actually just
[21:28] pop for example if I used let's say
[21:31] let's say I'm looking at this is a two
[21:34] bit code let's say we're just looking at
[21:35] a two bit code right here 0 0 0 1 1 1 1
[21:39] 0 those are the four options that's a
[21:41] total of eight bits however if we create
[21:45] something called the de de Bruin
[21:48] sequence um de Bruin is a mathematician
[21:50] who discovered this algorithm to
[21:53] efficiently produce all possible codes
[21:56] over that overlap so if if we overlap
[21:58] these we can say 0 01 1 0 now if we put
[22:01] them in B shift register we get 0 0 as
[22:04] the first two bits and if we move over
[22:06] just one bit then we get 01 move over
[22:08] one bit we get one one and then the last
[22:10] one zero so we've actually gotten all
[22:13] eight bits out of a five bit sequence
[22:15] now if we do that with every 8 to 12 bit
[22:19] code we actually reduce this down to 8
[22:22] seconds to Brute Force any fixed code
[22:25] garage between eight and 12 bits long
[22:28] eight seconds
[22:35] yeah um TV begone
[22:38] uh all the all of the infrared codes
[22:40] that are are basically public
[22:42] information for all the televisions um
[22:44] TV begon you could do that but TV begon
[22:46] specifically turns off TVs so if you
[22:49] were brute forcing what you'd actually
[22:50] end up doing is like changing the volume
[22:52] changing the import Source doing all
[22:53] this other stuff um TV begon
[22:55] specifically has programmed all of the
[22:57] IR codes for for most of the different
[22:59] televisions but you could definitely do
[23:00] something similar because you will hit
[23:02] the off code at some point right so at
[23:06] this point we have 8 seconds now this is
[23:07] just how to transmit rtlsdr does not
[23:10] actually transmit this is just an
[23:11] assumption of how we can uh uh mess with
[23:15] with this garage so now we need a device
[23:17] to to actually transmit um one device
[23:20] I'm a fan of is this yard stick one also
[23:22] by Michael Osman um this has a nice
[23:25] radio chip for both receiving and
[23:26] transmitting it's not software defined
[23:29] radio software defined radio allows you
[23:30] to take a very a signal you know nothing
[23:32] about and then perform all the
[23:34] modulation demodulation and um accessing
[23:37] and reading it in software this is all
[23:39] Hardware there there's pros and cons the
[23:42] the con the major con of something like
[23:45] this is that if you don't know what the
[23:46] signal is if you don't know if it's
[23:48] frequency modulated or amplitude
[23:49] modulated or the frequency this is not
[23:51] going to be too helpful because you have
[23:53] to tell this you have to tell this
[23:55] Hardware I know it's FSK I know it's on
[23:57] this frequency see I know it's this data
[23:58] rate and show me the data or transmit
[24:01] the data but if you know what you're
[24:03] looking for or you know what you want to
[24:04] transmit you can use this
[24:07] device and you there's a python
[24:09] interface that you can use um by
[24:10] something called rfcat and there's a
[24:13] another device that um that I like to
[24:16] use from this from one of the most
[24:19] amazing technological companies of our
[24:21] time
[24:23] Mattel so Mattel creates all sorts of
[24:27] awesome toys for children and one of
[24:29] their devices one of their toys is
[24:31] called the Mattel ime um this is a
[24:34] texting device for uh twins to basically
[24:38] communicate with each other without
[24:39] being on the internet where creepy
[24:41] creepy people hang out so with ime you
[24:44] can actually text someone and it
[24:45] wirelessly transmits to a little dongle
[24:47] on on a USB stick and then it goes over
[24:50] the internet to your friend who also has
[24:51] one of those USB dongles and then
[24:52] wirelessly transmits to the this little
[24:55] device to the ime um the service is no
[24:57] longer active they don't sell these
[24:59] anymore so you can get them off eBay for
[25:01] like $10
[25:02] $20 and a couple of people have found
[25:05] that inside of this device is a really
[25:07] cool chipset from Texas Instruments and
[25:10] it's a sub gigz transceiver that means
[25:13] it can receive and transmit on virtually
[25:15] any frequency under 1 GHz which is
[25:16] actually amazing if you try to build a
[25:19] device like this yourself it might cost
[25:20] hundreds of dollars thanks to Mattel and
[25:23] massive production you can get it for
[25:24] like 10 bucks on eBay so uh Travis
[25:28] Goodspeed and some other people found
[25:29] out that you can connect to the back of
[25:31] this thing and reprogram it and do
[25:33] whatever you want with that transceiver
[25:35] so this is the device I chose to use for
[25:37] transmitting across all the different
[25:39] garage frequencies performing this
[25:42] attack and this is a I call this the
[25:44] open sesame attack um let's see if it oh
[25:49] no oh
[25:51] no how do we get this
[25:54] to there should be a video here
[25:58] oh I'm
[25:59] sorry so that's an example of the open
[26:02] sesame just running on my friend's
[26:04] garage um it takes a total a max amount
[26:08] of 8 seconds which on average is 4
[26:10] seconds so
[26:13] awesome uh one one step down um so I've
[26:18] released almost everything to do this um
[26:20] obviously I don't want people to
[26:21] breaking into people's garages so I did
[26:23] not I bricked the code so that it would
[26:25] not work however I released most of it
[26:26] so that people could understand
[26:27] understand how this type of attack works
[26:29] and also how to how to prevent it uh
[26:31] unfortunately since I did that the
[26:32] prices have raised of the ime um so if
[26:36] you do want one reach out to me I I'll
[26:38] I'd be happy to send you one if you're
[26:39] going to do some research in this area
[26:40] because I bought them before they they
[26:42] became kind of ridiculously
[26:43] priced so some lessons here don't use a
[26:46] ridiculously small key space just
[26:48] because it's invisible right just
[26:50] because it's over radio and people
[26:51] aren't looking doesn't mean people
[26:52] aren't going to look right at some point
[26:54] people will look they will understand
[26:56] the technology uh your proprietary you
[26:59] know method is not going to help you so
[27:02] you know have there's plenty of
[27:04] information on this um require a
[27:06] preamble or sync word which is basically
[27:09] something that says the password's about
[27:10] to start that would prevent the de bruy
[27:12] attack where you can actually have all
[27:14] of these passwords sort of rolling over
[27:16] each other and then rolling codes that's
[27:18] another thing we'll talk about um
[27:20] rolling codes will prevent this type of
[27:21] attack so now we're inside of the garage
[27:24] and there's some cool stuff we can do
[27:26] here one thing that happening is all of
[27:28] our cars are becoming connected so great
[27:31] um so a lot of new cars now have all
[27:32] sorts of different radios inside besides
[27:34] the AM FM serus XM radios um they have
[27:37] some other things they often have GSM uh
[27:40] they'll have GPS receivers and they'll
[27:43] communicate with the internet who has
[27:45] OnStar OnStar yeah so okay a lot of you
[27:49] have OnStar and aren't raising your hand
[27:51] that's okay um so actually any GM
[27:54] vehicle GMC bu Cadillac actually has
[27:56] OnStar built-in now now you know whether
[27:58] you activate or not it's irrelevant uh
[27:59] you actually have these features and
[28:01] those features are connected to the
[28:02] computer of the car the ECU and the
[28:04] various other our cars are no longer
[28:06] cars they're they're no longer
[28:08] mechanical Vehicles right they're now
[28:10] essentially uh computer with wheels um
[28:13] so the computer controls so much I mean
[28:15] we have so many awesome features coming
[28:17] out in our vehicles like assisted Park
[28:19] um and all of these things if if there's
[28:21] something called assisted Park that
[28:22] means the vehicle the vehicle's computer
[28:24] has control of the wheel where before it
[28:26] used to be simply mechanical
[28:28] um now it's a computer that's actually
[28:29] able to turn your wheel so OnStar has a
[28:32] very cool feature uh they have an IOS
[28:34] and Android app so a friend of mine had
[28:37] actually with the same car he he had he
[28:38] had OnStar and I was playing with this
[28:40] stuff and he said you can play with my
[28:42] vehicle if you
[28:43] want so I was playing with the app I
[28:46] download OnStar um it does some cool
[28:48] stuff lets you see where your car is
[28:51] um lets you do a couple things there's a
[28:54] key fob access you can lock you can
[28:55] unlock remote start
[28:58] uh hit the horns and lights I tried that
[29:00] a few times while he was driving but uh
[29:03] they they fortunately they don't allow
[29:04] you to activate the horn and lights
[29:06] while you're driving which is smart um
[29:08] so I thought okay I'll I'll check out
[29:09] this communication I assume it's
[29:11] encrypted um with SSL so I'll install my
[29:13] own CA uh you know my own certificate
[29:16] Authority on my
[29:17] phone and I'll sniff the traffic you
[29:20] know lo and behold it wasn't crypted um
[29:22] I installed the CA and or or I I usually
[29:26] have my own certificate Authority
[29:27] installed on my on my mobile device and
[29:30] I started sniffing and because I was do
[29:34] using my own CA I could actually perform
[29:35] SSL man- in-the-middle attack um again
[29:38] this is only on my own my own device I
[29:39] can't do this on someone else's because
[29:41] they don't have my certificate Authority
[29:42] installed my certificate Authority tells
[29:45] my phone that oh Samy's you know House
[29:47] of Cards CA is a legitimate Authority
[29:50] you can use his key instead of the
[29:52] legitimate GM or OnStar uh SSL key so
[29:56] once I decrypted the the traffic I saw
[29:59] you know nice htps requests and plain
[30:01] text I saw some Bas 64 pulled out the b
[30:04] 64 and of course the password and
[30:06] username are right there like okay so
[30:10] make sure to not use you know the OnStar
[30:12] app on a uh Network that you don't trust
[30:15] uh but as long as as long as you don't
[30:18] have someone's CA they shouldn't be able
[30:19] to decrypt that traffic um and then I
[30:23] realized I had just reset my iPhone I
[30:25] forgot like something happened and I
[30:26] reset it so I actually didn't have my
[30:28] certificate Authority installed which
[30:30] means the app allowed an invalid
[30:34] certificate authority to decrypt traffic
[30:37] even though it had no recognition it had
[30:39] no idea who sami's House of Cards was so
[30:43] the GM app was not looking at an SSL CA
[30:47] it was blindly it will take accept any
[30:50] SSL key that means as long as you have
[30:53] someone on your Wi-Fi network which is
[30:55] very easy to do and they open that app
[30:58] you can decrypt all of their traffic for
[31:00] that app I thought wow like this is this
[31:04] is absolutely insane um so I like how
[31:07] can I exploit this and I created a
[31:09] device um with a Raspberry Pi computer
[31:12] uh a phone a GSM board um mallerie which
[31:15] is an open source uh SSL man INE middle
[31:17] attack software some DNS spoofing so
[31:20] that the user wouldn't actually detect
[31:21] anything so I only took over api. gm.com
[31:23] so anyone using OnStar but all of their
[31:26] other traffic would still continue to go
[31:28] through the correct servers and correct
[31:29] SSL certificates uh and a couple other
[31:32] things like a Alpha wireless card and
[31:35] then I thought okay how do I attack my
[31:36] friend how do I get him to jump onto my
[31:38] network now fortunately you can do
[31:39] things like you can use your own uh or
[31:42] you can use common Wi-Fi network names
[31:43] like ATT Wi-Fi or Starbucks um things
[31:46] that you know that they might be on but
[31:48] there's actually something pretty cool
[31:49] here another thing that are phones do is
[31:52] they send out probe requests so if your
[31:55] phone doesn't see your network
[31:58] it will actually send out probe requests
[32:00] saying hey I'm looking for a network in
[32:03] this case named tadong is there a
[32:05] network name to dong out here and you
[32:07] can say yes it actually tells you the
[32:10] network name it's looking for and with
[32:12] that information you can generate a
[32:14] network on the Fly which it will then
[32:16] join assuming that it's the correct
[32:18] Network it's actually our phones our
[32:20] devices our computers or laptops none of
[32:22] them actually look at the MAC address
[32:24] they're only looking at the network name
[32:26] now this is only for open networks if if
[32:28] your phone has only connected to
[32:29] encrypted networks fortunately this
[32:30] attack will not work but I'm assuming
[32:33] almost everyone has at least connected
[32:34] to One open um un encrypted Network
[32:37] before at Wii allones at Wi-Fi on almost
[32:41] all iPhones absolutely net gear links
[32:43] this I mean you can and the cool thing
[32:45] is you can just launch all of them right
[32:47] so if if you come near my house you may
[32:49] actually just see like 10 different
[32:50] network names for all the common
[32:54] ones so with under $100
[32:57] we have um a little device that I threw
[33:01] under my friend's car and
[33:03] uh was able to you know at some point
[33:06] let's see OnStar yes this this is an app
[33:09] called OnStar
[33:10] now so here I am and and once I acquired
[33:14] his credentials I was then able to
[33:16] unlock his car remote start it and
[33:18] basically do anything to his car at that
[33:20] point um and then I tested BMW which
[33:24] also did not check SSL certificates and
[33:27] I checked Mercedes-Benz which did not
[33:28] check SSL certificates and then I tested
[33:31] Chrysler Jeep which did not test SSL
[33:33] certificates this is a massive issue in
[33:35] virtually every I'd say this was like
[33:38] five out of 10 of the uh car apps that
[33:41] have the ability to unlock a vehicle
[33:43] right I only cared about the apps that
[33:45] actually did something you know
[33:47] important five of 10 did not perform SSL
[33:51] CA validation so the lesson's here if
[33:54] you're going to do this either validate
[33:56] certificates from a CA which actually I
[33:58] wouldn't necessarily suggest anymore um
[34:01] the nice thing about CA is you can like
[34:02] turn off your keys if they ever get
[34:04] stolen however there are a lot of
[34:05] certificate authorities out there for
[34:07] example like I don't know you wouldn't
[34:09] want the Hong Kong you know post to be
[34:11] releasing CA or releasing keys for you
[34:14] but they have that full capability they
[34:15] can say they own gmail.com if they want
[34:18] um and we've seen we've seen Cas get
[34:21] hacked before um or accidental keys for
[34:24] gmail.com get released before so better
[34:26] yet you certificate pinning this way
[34:29] your the the app that you release has a
[34:31] key in it you have that key those are
[34:33] the only people who know about this key
[34:34] no one else can you know avoid that um
[34:38] also hash the passwords like don't just
[34:41] B 64 everything right hash your
[34:43] passwords use assault make it difficult
[34:45] even if someone does obtain this
[34:47] information who knows how someone will
[34:48] break into your device sometime in the
[34:50] future there will be new attacks they
[34:52] will extract information in different
[34:53] ways and always assume you're on a
[34:55] hostile Network just always assume that
[34:58] so now we've broken into some cars um
[35:01] we'll go through this uh now there's
[35:03] another interesting thing that I've seen
[35:05] a lot of these vehicles use and a lot of
[35:07] the key fobs they all use something
[35:08] called rolling codes so rolling code is
[35:11] like we talked about before with the ca
[35:13] uh the code actually changes every time
[35:15] kind of like tofa you get a different
[35:16] SMS message or your Google Authenticator
[35:18] sends you a different number every time
[35:20] and that's great that's actually a
[35:21] really good way to prevent an attack
[35:23] like the key like the garage door attack
[35:25] right open sesame where we have a fixed
[35:27] code also rolling codes are much much
[35:30] longer they're not like silly 12- bit
[35:32] codes that you can break in a couple of
[35:33] seconds so that's a that's a nice thing
[35:36] I'll quickly run through some um
[35:38] Hardware attacks that uh if you're ever
[35:40] looking at Hardware that you don't know
[35:42] some of the devices I was looking at I
[35:43] was actually finding that they would
[35:45] actually Mark the chip off they would
[35:47] actually scratch off the name so I
[35:48] couldn't look up the data sheet and see
[35:50] what what it was
[35:51] using um so in that case what I use is I
[35:55] use a couple of things I use a logic
[35:56] analyzer logic analyzer just looks at
[35:58] looks at information looks at digital
[36:00] information going on a wire so you can
[36:02] connect pins to each of these pins um I
[36:05] use these SMD micro these micro probes
[36:07] so I can connect to like really small uh
[36:09] really small pins off of chips uh I also
[36:12] use a a multimeter um you can measure
[36:15] voltage with the multimeter off
[36:16] different different pins on a chip and
[36:19] when I'm looking at a chip that I don't
[36:20] know anything about I'll start mapping
[36:21] it out I can use the multimeter to find
[36:23] the ground and to find power so I can
[36:25] mark all the ground and Power power pins
[36:27] um also I can use the logic analyzer and
[36:31] I can look for certain things that look
[36:32] like a clock signal a clock signal will
[36:34] just look like a square wave or
[36:35] pulsewidth modulation um once I do that
[36:38] if I know what frequency it's
[36:40] communicating on which I should be able
[36:41] to learn with something like an rtlsdr
[36:43] or hackrf I can then download all the
[36:45] data sheets I can find for something
[36:47] that does that let's say it's
[36:48] communicating on 2.4 GHz I will download
[36:50] all the data sheets of transceivers on
[36:52] 2.4 GHz and then I'll take all their
[36:55] pinout pages and I'll look at them and
[36:57] I'll compare do any look similar to what
[36:59] I have do any have the same number of
[37:01] pins do any have the grounds in the same
[37:04] places the voltage in the same places
[37:05] the clock in the same place and if so
[37:08] I've now discovered what chip that that
[37:10] device is being used despite them trying
[37:12] to you know scratch it off um using the
[37:15] logic analyzer and data sheet I can see
[37:16] how that chip is communicating with the
[37:18] device what commands it's sending then
[37:20] I'll learn all sorts of other
[37:21] information like if there's encryption
[37:24] uh I might learn a key I might learn you
[37:25] know what's what it's using um I can
[37:28] extract all the serial communication how
[37:30] it communicates with that device and I
[37:32] can then build an interception device um
[37:34] which is pretty
[37:37] fun so uh at this point let's take a
[37:41] look at my car um my car uses something
[37:44] called rolling codes now if you look at
[37:46] this there's a ton more data in this
[37:48] code so this would actually take years
[37:50] and years and years to brute force uh
[37:52] and it's only good once so as soon as
[37:54] you use this code it will never work
[37:56] again again so when I hit the kick
[37:58] clicker on my car to unlock that code is
[38:01] used and my car knows that this code is
[38:03] no longer valid which is great so let's
[38:06] understand how rolling codes work
[38:07] there's basically a random number
[38:08] generator in your car and in your key
[38:11] and they're synced um there's actually
[38:13] like a rolling window so when you press
[38:15] the unlock button your car expects that
[38:17] unique identifier that unique code but
[38:19] now that the car is heard it it says I
[38:21] will never accept that again so if
[38:23] someone was sitting out if Nicholas Cage
[38:25] was outside of your home and he like
[38:26] sniffs this identifier and he tries to
[38:29] use it later on to replay it's not going
[38:30] to work because the car says oh I've
[38:32] seen that code before I will not accept
[38:34] it I will only accept the next code um
[38:36] and there's a rolling window so in case
[38:38] you know in case the the key is in your
[38:40] in your pocket and you hit it a bunch of
[38:41] times out of range of the car then you
[38:44] go back to the car the car will say oh
[38:46] you're actually out of range but it's
[38:47] okay you know you're you're in the
[38:49] future right you're not using a past
[38:51] code you're just a little bit in the
[38:52] future you probably hit the button
[38:53] accidentally a few times that's okay now
[38:56] that's only a small window so it's it's
[38:58] hard to uh use that to attack so I was
[39:01] trying to find ways of replaying rolling
[39:03] codes of attacking that the only you
[39:04] know the major way I could think of was
[39:06] the only way is to capture a signal
[39:08] while you're out of range of the car so
[39:10] if you like break into someone's house
[39:12] take their car hit the button record it
[39:14] and then go back later and then replay
[39:16] it now all of most cars these days also
[39:19] use this for starting the vehicle as
[39:21] well so these attacks are actually not
[39:22] only for unlocking vehicles but Al also
[39:25] starting um now this is is a really lame
[39:26] attack I think if you're in their house
[39:28] and you have access to their key you
[39:30] should just take it um so how can we how
[39:33] can we get around this what if we Jam
[39:37] what if we Jam the code now again these
[39:40] keys are inexpensive so they're I mean
[39:42] they'll charge you like $300 to buy one
[39:44] but they're actually really cheap um so
[39:46] it's it's actually very easy to
[39:48] interfere with this communication so
[39:51] when someone hits their button if you're
[39:53] actually transmitting as well in fact if
[39:55] you even have the same a similar key and
[39:57] you hold down the unlock or lock button
[39:59] of your key while someone tries to
[40:00] unlock their car they won't be able to
[40:02] unlock their car you can actually do
[40:03] this for kind of a wide range um it's
[40:06] kind of funny to watch uh but you can
[40:09] basically easily interfere with this
[40:11] communication so so worst case scenario
[40:13] they might have to like pull out their
[40:14] key now who has hit their button of
[40:16] their key and it didn't work once that
[40:18] happens right and you just hit it again
[40:19] and it typically works right there was
[40:21] some interference or you didn't hold it
[40:22] long enough so what if I Jam
[40:27] just slightly off just slightly off the
[40:29] frequency and I also listen I also use a
[40:32] similar device to listen I can actually
[40:34] be very specific and listen to just that
[40:36] signal and listen to their code and
[40:39] ignore my jamming because I know where
[40:40] I'm jamming I can ignore that piece of
[40:42] the the signal the problem is once I've
[40:45] recorded that signal that the car is not
[40:46] heard I can use that signal now I can
[40:48] use it to unlock however they're going
[40:50] to keep hitting it until it works and
[40:52] when it works when the car does hear
[40:54] their unlock code all previous codes get
[40:57] disabled so the code that I've acquired
[40:59] is now no longer
[41:01] useful however as we're human we all
[41:04] follow a simple
[41:05] pattern if I jam and I listen and I get
[41:08] one code and I keep jamming so you go up
[41:11] to your car you you hit unlock it
[41:13] doesn't work you hit unlock again it
[41:15] doesn't work two times in a row but I've
[41:17] listened to both codes and I've
[41:19] extracted those two passwords I now take
[41:21] those two and I only replay the first
[41:24] one so now the carard does on the lock
[41:26] on the second time but I'm using the
[41:28] first code so later on when you go home
[41:31] and you lock your car I still have an
[41:33] unused future code that I can unlock
[41:36] your
[41:37] vehicle because there's actually no
[41:39] timing right it's all about just the
[41:41] order of the sequence of these codes so
[41:43] you can essentially trick the user by
[41:45] playing the first one on their second
[41:47] time and of course you can automate this
[41:51] um so this is an attack I call roll Jam
[41:55] I've demonstrated with about 30 in
[41:56] hardware and there's so many other
[41:58] attacks in this area I mean it's such I
[42:00] think it's such an exciting area because
[42:02] you have cars coming out this year in
[42:03] 2016 that will actually communicate with
[42:05] other vehicles on the road it's called
[42:07] v2v so there's so much other radio
[42:09] communication that's going to be
[42:10] happening um you know cars are able to
[42:13] use ultrasound to see if there's
[42:14] something in front of them but what if
[42:15] you send your own ultrasound right what
[42:17] I mean you can generate ultrasound it's
[42:18] just sound at a higher frequency what if
[42:20] you send that to a vehicle you can make
[42:22] it believe that someone is in front of
[42:23] you you can you can send communication
[42:25] to cars saying that it's it's really
[42:27] rainy so slow down you just make
[42:28] everyone slow down around you I mean you
[42:30] can do all sorts of stuff um it's crazy
[42:32] and it's scary and it's exciting uh
[42:35] there's so so many other interesting
[42:37] attacks um I was also looking at my at
[42:39] my car and I found that if they're
[42:41] locking the vehicle if they're hitting
[42:42] lock lock lock and I record that data or
[42:45] inter interfere with that data well I
[42:46] can't use a lock to like that's no good
[42:49] I can't what what fun is locking their
[42:50] car however I found in the signal as I
[42:53] was looking at the data sheet I found
[42:55] that the rolling code is one part and
[42:57] then the command is the second part so I
[43:00] could change the command from Lock to
[43:02] unlock and use the same code as long as
[43:05] I jammed and interfered their lock
[43:07] command then I can use that lock command
[43:10] to unlock so even though it hit they hit
[43:12] lock later on I come over I S I send an
[43:14] unlock just by changing that bit because
[43:16] it's just a command not tied to the code
[43:18] in any way um here's the the device
[43:22] itself I tested on a lot of cars it
[43:24] unlocked a lot of cars
[43:26] and it was
[43:29] beautiful um lessons I mean in you know
[43:33] encrypt hash those buttons together so
[43:35] if if you're sending a lock command for
[43:37] example and of course this this works
[43:39] anywhere this will work on HTTP like you
[43:41] should use these same uh these same
[43:43] methods um encrypt that encrypt or hash
[43:46] that communication together right hash
[43:48] the key hash the key with the uh command
[43:53] um use hmax uh time based algorithms
[43:55] there's actually something called uh I
[43:57] mean we've had secure ID for 20 years
[43:59] now right those RSA RSA tokens which uh
[44:02] are essentially 2fa we've had those for
[44:04] 20 years and every 2015 car I've
[44:07] attacked has had this issue um we can
[44:09] implement this stuff this stuff exists
[44:11] we know about these we know about these
[44:12] problems and we know how to solve them
[44:15] um also you can do challenge response
[44:17] with transceivers rather than just cheap
[44:19] receivers so there ways of fixing this
[44:22] um and you know that that's that's about
[44:25] it that's that's what I have for you um
[44:27] thanks so much for coming I hope you
[44:28] guys enjoyed it and uh happy to take any
[44:36] questions thanks yeah yes did you report
[44:40] any of
[44:41] those apps that accepted I reported all
[44:44] of them yeah communicated with what did
[44:46] they do they fortunately they all came
[44:48] out with new apps um well the first one
[44:50] GM did not re reach out I mean it was
[44:53] impossible to contact them they had no
[44:54] like uh uh um they had no way for
[44:58] researchers to reach them uh so I called
[45:00] them I went to the support I escalated I
[45:02] emailed uh I went through their website
[45:04] I mean literally never heard back and
[45:06] then uh I then I released a
[45:08] demonstration I didn't release the code
[45:10] or anything uh and then I got called the
[45:12] you know like within 24
[45:14] hours and then bz BMW Etc they all did
[45:18] fix I mean everything everyone fixed it
[45:20] within a few days which is great because
[45:22] it just an app update yes reports you
[45:25] file
[45:31] uh none of them had none of them had
[45:33] Bounty programs or none of them had
[45:35] security presences that I could actually
[45:36] communicate with it was literally I mean
[45:38] literally all of these companies I had
[45:39] to just uh they had no security response
[45:43] right this is this is new areas at least
[45:44] for the vehicles um now GM does now GM
[45:48] does have a security
[45:51] program I'm sure they
[45:53] do yes
[46:03] and
[46:11] correct because so this is the this is
[46:14] the device um I have actually a new
[46:17] device I've created that's smaller and
[46:18] cheaper this is $30 and you put it under
[46:21] their car so it always has the next code
[46:24] oh I see yeah so you just it literally
[46:26] they have to press the button twice
[46:28] every time and we adapt pretty quickly
[46:30] we just get used to it right now you
[46:31] just hit it twice like works the second
[46:33] time every
[46:40] time what's that absolutely that's a
[46:42] great idea yeah actually you could do
[46:44] that so you only need to inconvenience
[46:45] them once that's a good point I didn't
[46:46] think of that successful field test that
[46:50] correct yes many many field
[46:53] tests you'll actually see the the lot is
[46:56] like half empty
[46:57] now thanks for
[46:59] [Laughter]
[47:04] coming any other
[47:06] questions
[47:16] yes
[47:19] sure yeah I mean the amplification
[47:21] attack is really interesting right a lot
[47:22] of us have keys that we keep in our
[47:24] vehicle or we keep in our pocket and we
[47:26] can go up to our car pull the door and
[47:28] it'll send a signal out that our key
[47:30] detects and then it will perform a
[47:32] challenge response back right and for
[47:35] starting the car it actually uses the
[47:37] signal strength so it knows that you're
[47:38] in the car so if the signal strength is
[47:40] too low it says oh you're outside of the
[47:41] car I'm not going to start the vehicle
[47:42] you have to be inside the car but as you
[47:44] say you can perform an amplification
[47:46] attack where you actually let's say you
[47:48] have two people right and you go up to
[47:49] the car you pull the door it sends the
[47:52] signal your device amplifies that signal
[47:55] or sends it wirelessly somewhere else
[47:57] that gets retransmitted near the door or
[48:00] near the near the person's car key in a
[48:02] restaurant or outside of their house and
[48:04] yeah you can then unlock and start their
[48:06] vehicle and drive away and vehicles
[48:08] cannot stop if they detect the keys no
[48:10] longer in the car it would' be too
[48:11] dangerous right if you're on the freeway
[48:12] or something what happens so the car
[48:14] will continue to go and you take it to
[48:15] your Chop
[48:17] Shop
[48:24] yes
[48:30] that's correct uh all of them do have
[48:33] some amount of timing um but it's lacks
[48:36] enough that you can perform the attack
[48:37] in every case that I've seen
[48:48] yes
[48:54] yes um
[48:58] no I know yeah I mean they're all you
[49:01] know Vehicles they're all using some of
[49:02] the same chipsets from the same
[49:04] companies um so it's all the same attack
[49:12] yeah yeah
[49:19] yeah absolutely you know I mean I feel
[49:22] like this is you know I think we were
[49:24] talking about it earlier like this is
[49:25] the web 10 years ago right 10 15 years
[49:27] ago everything had xss everything had
[49:29] SQL you know sqli everything had RFI now
[49:33] only most things have xss and sqi and
[49:37] RFI so I think in another 10 years
[49:38] hopefully we'll have a lot more hardware
[49:40] and radio security I hope so yeah I
[49:43] suspect we will
[49:51] yeah uh that was a different that was
[49:53] someone else yeah yeah
[50:02] yes what security people no no seriously
[50:05] I don't think they have security
[50:07] people I think that's a new thing right
[50:11] yes Le
[50:24] Scag oh interesting wow I didn't know
[50:26] that that's very
[50:34] cool
[50:37] awesome yeah
[50:40] yeah okay well thanks so much
[50:44] everyone all
[50:54] right
[50:56] [Music]

The parking attendant literally said...

“I didn’t think about it. I thought maybe it was a friend or something, I dunno.”

You should really try and get that person fired. That is an unbelievable level of incompetence and that response is just insulting. So sorry this happened to you. It must be tempting to just douse it in gas and give it a cleansing fire.

The attendant is just there to collect money and make sure no one parks for free. They don't care about what happens to your car. Heck, the back of the ticket basically says "We don't care what happens to your car, and won't give you any money if anything does happen to it. Park at your own risk."

Talk to a lawyer. This may be gross negligence, which the standard writing on the back of a parking slip does not cover. It’s their lot and they do actually have some liability for things that happen there.

When I opened the door the first time
my immediate dread was a soup kitchen
had gone down.

No lie.
Because homeless people come to the stair wells of the lot to have sex and this car would be a step up.

Am I not seeing something? Because there is nothing in this picture that remotely makes it look trashed. I imagine it would be of course with a homeless person breaking in and living in there but it doesn’t look bad in this picture.

happened this weekend.

Upon arriving back from a trip, I discovered my car was broken into and completely trashed. The police wouldn’t come because there was no one in it and it was considered non-emergency.
Told me report online. Called insurance, said they’d follow up on Monday.

Then, this morning my neighbor banged on my door, waking me up to tell me “someone’s in your car right now!”

They already called the cops.

I got dressed and walked up the lot calmly with mercy (my golden baseball bat) just as a means to keep whoever it was at a distance. Not beat anyone. I opened the door and she looked at me like “...you have the audacity to open my door.”

Yeah, she’s a woman. She broke into the car from the other side facing the railing, thru the window so it appeared fine on the other side to passerby’s.

She was putting pants on when I opened the door. There were panties, other people’s I.D.s and other clothing on the floor.

The car reeks so badly of smoke, beer and urine i couldn’t get in. She was pantless at first, had a plate full of cigarette butts and a pipe on the seat like a bed rest. Also discovered she peed in the car behind the driver seat and put the seats down to lay out, tossing everything in my trunk all around the car, somewhere in the process pouring bleach I had I. The back for laundry, on the seats and floor. She had a makeup thing that blew up in the drivers seat too.

I said quietly but shaking with anger, “why? Why would you break into and make your home in a perfectly good condition car? There are so many services in this area to help you, to give you a home, why? Do you know what it’ll cost for me to fix this?”

She said ,”I have a place, I’ll pay. (Incoherent)”.
And got annoyed, started rambling.

I yelled ,” YOU RUINED MY CAR!!!”
She responded incoherently.
I slammed the door and locked her in.

The cops arrive about 5 seconds after that.

They asked who’s car it was, I said mine and immediately they swerved over and got out of the car.

Pull guns, “GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!”
I stepped out in front and said, “WHOA! I just talked to her, she’s an older homeless woman, she’s not armed.” They told me to step back.

I told them guns were not necessary I’d get her out if needed. They scolded me but I said I was just informing them of the situation before they escalated it based on having no info. I saw police here kill a homeless man on Hope St. just two months prior.

She got arrested and struggled and cursed.
Cops told me they can’t prove she was the one who broke in. It’s technically not a crime to sit in someone’s car.... yeah

They said they would “try” to charge her with vandalism and burglary because the car was damaged and $10 was missing from the car.

There’s more but this is long.
Gonna need a new window, body work (door is dented badly) and a deep clean so fresh the hell will smell the lemons.

This post is partially just to help me process it as I find it both infuriating and hilarious (dirty mike irl) that I come home from a vacay I took intentionally to relieve stress, to this. Could be worse. A huge inconvenience and cost, but could be worse.

Yikes. Sorry that happened to you. This recently happened to our neighbor’s house - it had sold and they were moved out and were waiting on closing. During that time, a person moved in and moved some furniture in and parked in their garage. They were living there like it was their house. The place was wrecked but they had set flowers out on the kitchen counter 😂

I should have recorded the whole interaction.

I was very calm at first until she started trying to defend herself instead of apologizing.

I asked her specifically “why did you break in my car” ... her response was, “I didn’t know it was your car I was scared.” I can’t remember exactly what else she said but she definitely admitted it.

I just didn’t want to record the whole interaction as it seemed unnatural and in my mind I was like “that’s too IG and this is real life”.

Hey now, they're also good for defending Rodeo Drive while poorer parts of the city burn to the ground.

Also, someone's gotta clean up all the donuts our instagram influencers take 1 nibble of and leave behind.

Jurisdiction between districts in LA is an absolute nightmare altogether. BHPD is rather hilariously bored- and hyper vigilant as a result. If you’re north of Wilshire you can expect them in like a minute and a half if you call. My grandparents have a house in the flats so I’ve had some experiences with them. I’ll never forget about how hyped up they got during the riots in ‘92 when there was a window of fear that the riot would actually breach the entirety of the city, all the way to Beverly Hills. We lived in weho and were scared, which retrospectively is a bit silly but the riots were terrifying (also I was 6 so the whole city being on fire was totally plausible in my mind). BHPD were like “YES, FINALLY WE GET TO USE OUR GEAR!”. All suited up with nowhere to go, lol. Another fave is when I was 17 and one of my best friends lived on Camden. We had been taking a fashion design class at OTIS and were up super late working on our final project so we decided to take a walk along Rodeo to get some air and maybe some design inspiration. We’d been on Rodeo for about 90 seconds when 2 cop cars pulled up to us and asked what we were up to, if they could “help us” etc. They were young guys and after we explained what we were doing and that we were local they spent like 5 minutes shooting the shit and flirting with us. It was very silly. Don’t trust that courthouse though, I once paid a ticket in person and they never fucking filed it so I unknowingly drove around with a suspended license for 2 whole years. Literally didn’t know until I tried to renew it.

> Rodeo Drive (the famous part, at least) is protected by the Beverly Hills Police Department.

I'm aware of the on-paper jurisdictions. And yet LAPD still spent resources protecting non-LA cities while parts of LA were left to burn.

> During this period, **the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies abandoned Koreatown**, a rectangular area which covers about 150 blocks between Eighth Street and Irolo Street, west of MacArthur Park.[68] Koreans had begun settling in the Mid-Wilshire area in the 1960s after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. It was here that many opened successful businesses.[69]
>
> As the riots spread, roads between Koreatown and wealthy white neighborhoods were blocked off by police and **official defense lines were set up around the independent cities such as Beverly Hills and West Hollywood.**

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots#Day_2_%E2%80%93_Thursday,_April_30>

Basically, you're describing what they should've done. I'm describing what they did.

LAPD abandoned South Central and Koreatown to burn, in order to defend Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, even though the latter are separate municipalities while the former are parts of the City of LA. Because BH and WeHo were/are rich, and South Central and Ktown were/are not. They showed where their true loyalties lie, and it wasn't necessarily to those within the geographical borders of the City of LA, even though that's who they ostensibly work for.

I'm with you, but this is also precisely why cops shouldn't try to dissuade victims from seeking charges against people. I've had a cop try to skip out on filing a report for a break in because not enough was stolen in terms of raw dollar amount to constitute a felony, but I wasn't having that, I needed the report regardless for insurance.

Yeah that’s exactly what he tried to do.

He was like “I mean you just need the window fixed right? How much will that cost.”

I said nah...
this damage is a minimum of $5000.

Some people severely underestimate how expensive it is to repair a car, even what is seemingly minor damage. If a fender bender can be close to $900, I can't imagine how much it will cost to repair all of that damage.

Best of luck with all of that.

I stopped at a stop sign a year ago in my sedan and the lady behind me in her Land Rover was on her phone and hit me. She couldn't have been going more than 1 or 2 mph but because her bumper was so much higher than mine, it hit it in such a way that it not only severely dented the bumper but also the trunk door, which then couldn't close completely. It ended up costing like $3,500.

General rule of thumb is that if the damage is visible and beyond a minor scratch, expect to pay a minimum $750 to return to new condition.

I had my catalytic converter stolen a few months back and the cops (over the phone - they would not come out) marked it as "under $500." Total cost before insurance was $2800. So yeah... they're cops, not claim adjusters. (And the job they do as cops is.....questionable)

Eh Cops are human beings so it really is a case by case basis.

There are cops who take their job as protector very seriously and there are cops who use that power for their own profit. I'd say a cop could either be your enemy or friend depending on the person.

I have friends who are EMTs and they tell me they generally don't see people as individual humans, they see them as the trauma they have to treat. Kind of a coping mechanism to get through brutal days. I think, even based on my limited interactions as a law-abiding citizen and infrequent victim of crime, that even the "good" police tend to cope the same way. I doubt you could deal with the crap they see constantly and maintain high levels of empathy and not burn out. This is no excuse for them to be shitty to people, but I think it explains why the typical range of human behavior doesn't hold as well for them and a lot come off as shitty to victims. And these are the police who are normal people and not criminal, half-baked walnuts.

I recently had a window smashed out by a man with a machete and while the cops were way more chill with me than I had expected, it was also apparent they were going to do absolutely nothing and didn't even pretend that I wasn't an inconvenience. I'm fine, and I'm sure they're great with their spouses and kids, but if they were bartenders they weren't going to get a tip. :)

(In before someone else misses the point- I'm not saying they have to be customer service reps in order for me to give them money, it's an admittedly weak analogy)

My EMT instructor told us to treat the meat, which sounds brutally necessary and practical until you encounter your first psychiatric patient. His co-instructor emphasized kindness above all, which (along with treatment) is difficult to provide to a flailing shrieker when you're distracted by concern for your own safety.

IMO, first responders really aren't provided enough training in interacting with the mentally ill. And too many responders start out with a dearth of inherent kindness, and then have the gall blame "burnout" for abusive behavior.

I have several friends who are firefighters and cops, and the attitude is pretty universal. You have to be able to compartmentalize to do the job.

One of my firefighter friends said that when he was first on the job and they had to go on a call with an injured child (drowning, car accident, etc) he would go home after his shift and break down in tears because he just couldn't handle seeing kids hurt like that. He is like 6'4"- 260, played football in college, etc. - not the kind of "man" you would expect to not be able to handle it. He's been a firefighter for over 10 years now, and he did get counseling and is better, but still HATES having to go out on calls with kids.

My friend who is LAPD says that he has to think the same way, or he wouldn't be able to do his job.

I encourage everyone to do some research on [Vicarious Trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_traumatization) It is a very real, and difficult thing for people who are first responders, social workers, therapists, etc.

The other day my wife was walking to the train and this crazy was throwing garbage at passing cars and people.

And don’t call the nearest station, they will just tell you to call 911 where the dispatcher puts the call at the bottom because its a crazy. Fucking useless.

I could be way off but from my understanding, "trespass" is generally limited to property related to land like fields, domiciles or the curtilage thereof. Infringing on OP's property rights of their car would technically be considered "trespass to chattels" (or "conversion" if the car is in such bad shape that it is no longer useable), which is only a civil claim rather than a criminal claim.

There are probably other criminal laws that the person violated but I don't think trespass is one of them.

Yeah I was trying to explain to the insurance that the car is unsalvageable. She peed in it and smoked crack in it. Lived in it for at least 5 days as a lot attendant said he saw her in there Wednesday (yet did nothing). I just want it gone so I can get a new one and carry on. It feels like it’s not my car anymore sadly.

Crazy thing is - this is a county lot.

There is a camera - doesn’t work. Police park here throughout the day and pass thru constantly before 6pm. Neighborhood security comes thru the lot at least 5 times a day on bike and in cars into the night.

When I was talking them I was literally holding back blerting out “what good are you?”. But I don’t care. Just wanted her out so I could move on.

Haha this is so LA. Between there and downtown SF this is pretty common.

I once came outside and found all the contents of my car spread around a man knocked the fuck out on the curb. Literally in front of my car. While still sleep I called the cops and 2 hours later they came.

When you go to buy a new car, get a soft-top jeep and just always leave the roof down. Then nobody will want to sleep in your car! Jk, but seriously, I’m sorry that this happened to you. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that this’ll be one hell of a story to tell next time you’re having dinner with a bunch of people who don’t live in LA.

Ha, how naive. She's old and a lady, must be safe! Or she is a crackhead that possibly has other mental health issues and flies into a full on psychotic episode after a years long binge, stabbing you with what she has nearby; an HIV infected piece of glass.

Are you fully insured or liability only? Your insurance would likely salvage the car or at least help you... if you have AAA you could tow it to somewhere for a deep clean detail

Also, you can’t expect them to charge her when you literally just told them she is harmless and that you would get her out yourself.

To review: Someone else calls the police because there’s a homeless person in their neighbor’s car. Police arrive and owner of the car tells them to back off, and that the person is just a harmless old lady.

So what are the police supposed to do?

Let’s not forget you also confirmed with the police that there was no one in the car previously, when you originally reported it to them, so who is to say it wasn’t a completely different homeless person in there prior? A different homeless person could have easily been the one to make the mess. This one could have stumbled upon it and made herself comfortable after and like they said, that’s not a crime.

> Pull guns, “GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!” I stepped out in front and said, “WHOA! I just talked to her, she’s an older homeless woman, she’s not armed.”

This was them trying to escalate the situation to have her do something reckless so they could charge her with a felony. You prevented them from doing this. Is how they responded good? No, but as the lone cop in the thread rightly said, there's no direct evidence she broke into your car, and Prop 47 reduced all of the things she did to your car to misdemeanors. Their behavior was trying to get past that uncomfortable fact.

> They said they would “try” to charge her with vandalism and burglary because the car was damaged

The car has thousands of dollars of damage. There's no question that she committed a felony... if someone spends the time and money to prove the smoke and pee was hers. If you follow up on this with insurance and the police, she might go to jail, but likely not, because it's not like they'll spend the money to do a DNA test. Jail is unfortunately the best current option for all involved, including her. (We can pretend social services can handle her, but they'll deem her not a threat and just release her quickly, which does nobody any good.)

Insurance should cover everything including having to pay somebody to throw away all that garbage. It might’ve been better if they stole your car so you can claim it a total loss and get a check to buy a new car.

Edit: you will have to pay a deductible though, usually $500 or $1k depending on which policy you purchased

Few things about orange county: The same day California approved more funding for homeless shelters a large homeless camp near Angel stadium by the dry cement river was bulldozed. The homeless just moved to the other side.

There's very little homeless support, by design, in OC. Homeless people are bussed out to LA frequently and it's been a criminalized in several upscale cities. You can call to have someone picked up if you see them sleeping out.

I have a friend who had their car stolen in LA and it sounds like it was in a similar state after a few days. The insurance company decided to total the car instead of attempt to clean it. We suspect the cost to get the smells out and potential risks from remnant drug paraphernalia made the insurance company just not want to deal with an ongoing issues.

Chief "nah, whos to say that someone else didnt murder this guy, and then he came along, covered himself in blood because it looks cool and then grabbed the knife to pull it out. It's literally an unprovable case... Cant solve them all Rook."

Rookie Officer: "well we could fingerprint the knife, check the blood for his DNA since he cut himself, canvas the area for cameras that saw something"

I was just going to say that. So many cars parked in SFs with signs on them "DON'T BREAK WINDOW. CAR IS UNLOCKED" because so many homeless break the windows to sleep in the cars at night. So utterly terrible that people have to deal with that... and that the homeless have to or decide to resort to that.

Yeah the homeless "advocates" who've really come out in force here and on the San Francisco subreddit lately are going to avoid this thread like the plague since it doesn't reinforce their narrative that the homeless are down on their luck average humans priced out of the city they lived in all their lives.

No one has a retort for a picture of a bat shit crazy drug addict who pisses on their own "bed" and breaks into people's cars.

Just...wow. As a car guy, I am very much emotionally connected to my vehicles. I don't think I could have possibly had as much restraint as you did, especially if I had a bat in my hand.

I am so fucking sorry this happened to you OP. Why didn't the parking attendants do or say anything? That is so infuriating.

Just burn the car and have your insurance company take care of it.

Glad that the cops assumed that OP on his way to a baseball game with his golden baseball bat "Mercy." If they were jerks, about OP giving them advice about how to handle the situation, the cops may have been able to pin OP with "possession of a deadly weapon with intent to assault." Likely wouldn't stick but it still be a pain to deal with.

You just needed to show more empathy according to some people on this subreddit. You should've have let her stay and invited her to live in your apartment as well as paying for all her drugs and other interests.

We need to be honest that they're a mixed bag if we're gonna come up with solutions for the crisis. We can't pretend they're all innocent, down on their luck, and just in need of cheap housing and a break. We also can't pretend they're all mentally unhinged and addicted to drugs.

The city's official stance at the moment seems to be "they're all innocent and in need of a break." Thus, we pretend housing tents around the city are gonna take care of problems like this.

Agreed, I was more on the compassionate side, until I have seen WTF is going on in this city. Look at the syringes, condoms, and poop on the streets of what was once America's most beautiful city, San Francisco? Look at the tent encampments under every overpass or pretty much anywhere in LA! Do you know who does a good job? Beverly Fucking Hills! Go to Weho or WLA, and they are everywhere, I don't know how they do it...

I just watched an article about similar changes in Seattle. Nobody really has a good solution, it's either "stick all these people in free apartments at great expense" or "run them out of the city".

Also, it seems like Beverly Hills and WeHo just keep them out of public view. My cousin was working on a high-end retail space in WeHo and a homeless guy was living in their building and shitting in the alley. They moved him out and apparently he moved into another construction site down the street.

Have a car with a push-to-start ignition? Here's how it could end up stolen and overseas | CBC News Loaded[Canada](/news/canada)·MARKETPLACE
# Have a car with a push-to-start ignition? Here's how it could end up stolen and overseas

Cars stolen from Ontario and Quebec are openly being advertised and sold in West African countries, including Nigeria and Ghana, according to a Marketplace investigation, which also found thieves are targeting vehicles with push-to-start ignitions.
## Marketplace investigation finds stolen cars from Ontario and Quebec in Nigeria’s used car lots

## Social Sharing

Cars stolen from Ontario and Quebec are openly being advertised and sold in West African countries, including Nigeria and Ghana, according to a *Marketplace* investigation, which also found thieves are targeting vehicles with push-to-start ignitions.

Stolen vehicles are being shipped overseas by thieves so audacious, they leave behind takeout containers, identifiable bumper stickers and even licence plates.

* [**Watch the full *Marketplace* investigation on CBC Gem**](https://gem.cbc.ca/media/marketplace/s49e15)

Experts say that car companies prioritizing convenience over security with those push-to-start ignitions allow thieves to quickly and easily steal vehicles to ship overseas, where demand for Canadian cars is high because of their reliability and the availability of parts, and the consequences for thieves are low.

"It's low risk, high reward," said Det. Greg O'Connor of the Peel police auto crime unit, who told *Marketplace* this type of car theft has a low overhead cost and takes little time. Cars can be loaded onto shipping containers and be en route within hours, he said.

Police in Peel Region, west of Toronto, say that 80 to 85 per cent of stolen vehicles are tied to organized crime and destined to be shipped overseas, many to West Africa.

Other stolen vehicles can be given a new, fake vehicle identification number (VIN) and resold within Canada, or used to transfer drugs, guns or for human trafficking.

"This isn't a victimless crime," said O'Connor.

*Marketplace* was able to find stolen Canadian vehicles in Ghana and Nigeria. On the website Jiji, an online marketplace similar to Kijiji, vehicles that are foreign-owned are heavily advertised, and the cars can sell for nearly double the cost they would go for in Canada. A 2018 Lexus RX 350 was listed for sale for 28,000,000 Naira, or about $85,000 Cdn. That same vehicle with similar mileage has a market price of around $48,000 on Autotrader.ca.

Some sellers don't even remove Ontario licence plates or Canadian dealership stickers. One image from Ghana in 2017 shows cars with Ontario licence plates advertised along the main road. In February, researchers were able to find a 2018 Lexus RX 350 on a used car lot in Lagos, Nigeria. The vehicle had undergone a safety inspection in Niagara Region, in southern Ontario, in August 2021. CBC cannot confirm when it was stolen.

## How it's done

You've likely heard of the "relay attack," in which a device is used to capture the signal of a car key fob that is inside a house and then amplified to open car doors. But experts say there's a cheaper — and easier — solution thieves are turning to: lock picks. These tools are available for under $60 on online marketplaces.

Once inside the car, thieves typically plug a key programmer — available for under $1,000 online — into the car's On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) port, usually located under the steering wheel where mechanics can plug in a diagnostic tool to the car's computer. Using this port, thieves can program a blank key fob to match the vehicle. It can be done on nearly any vehicle with a push-to-start ignition. Vehicles with physical keys require a separate tool to clone the key.

How your car can be stolen in less than two minutes

3 years agoDuration 0:59Thieves are stealing cars from driveways and shopping malls in Canada using inexpensive tools. This locksmith showed us how easy it can be to steal a vehicle with a push-to-start ignition.

It's an issue locksmith and founder of Hamilton's Auto Key Pro Yaser Jafar says needs more regulation.

"Anyone can buy these tools and do whatever they want," he told *Marketplace*. "When it's in the wrong hands, and if they have a little experience, or if they learn it, very quickly they can easily steal any car that they want."

More safeguards, such as a regulating body for locksmiths or a registration process to purchase tools, can prevent locksmith tools from getting into the wrong hands and would help curb theft, Jafar said.

Once the vehicle is stolen and left in a "cool down" spot to ensure it isn't being tracked, cars are typically driven to Montreal or Halifax, placed in shipping containers and shipped overseas. This can happen in as little as 24 hours, say police.

Honda's CR-V, Toyota's Highlander, Lexus's RX and Ford's F-150 are among some of the most popular models of cars stolen in Canada. O'Connor says it can take as little as two to 13 minutes to steal these vehicles.

The Insurance Bureau of Canada's list of top stolen cars includes the CR-V and F-150, but *Marketplace* was able to look at car theft data in Ontario and adjust theft rates for number of cars insured. Vehicles on this list include mostly luxury vehicles, including Lexus and Range Rover models.

![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6396266.1648141450!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/most-stolen-cars-in-ontario.jpg?im=)

Surprisingly, data obtained by *Marketplace* shows that electric vehicles are rarely stolen, and only one Tesla has ever been reported stolen in Ontario. Experts chalk this up to minimal infrastructure — and demand — for electric vehicles overseas, and enhanced security features like pass codes and 360 cameras.

In January, Peel police announced a multi-jurisdictional investigation — Project High Five — that resulted in 321 criminal charges and recovered more than 200 stolen vehicles. Some cars even had takeout containers and masks still in them when they were seized.

But Project High Five wasn't the solution to car theft. Just days after the arrests were made, Bart Evans had his 2018 Ford F-150 stolen from Sherway Gardens, a shopping mall in suburban Toronto, in the middle of the afternoon. It hasn't been recovered.

![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6396270.1648141494!/fileImage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/original_1180/project-high-five-shipping-container.png?im=)

Project High Five recovered over 200 stolen cars, some stuffed in shipping containers with Ontario licence plates and stickers still on the vehicles. (CBC)

Now Evans is shopping for a replacement F-150. "My wife asked me, 'Do they still make The Club?' I said, 'Yes they do!' I'll be sticking that on (my new truck)."

## 'Manufacturers could certainly step up'

*Marketplace* heard from many victims of car theft who appeared to be doing everything right — storing keys in signal-blocking pouches or containers to prevent relay attacks, having security cameras on their driveways, even using a security club to lock their steering wheel and prevent the car from being able to turn. But police warn that thieves are quick to catch up to these methods and work around them.

* [**Click here for statements from those featured in our story**](http://www.cbc.ca/1.6397343)

"It shouldn't be this easy," said O'Connor. "The manufacturers could certainly step up, but with these vehicles being stolen they also sell more vehicles, and when vehicles need to be repaired they're selling more parts."

![](https://i.cbc.ca/1.6396273.1648141599!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/peel-lock-pick.jpg?im=)

*Marketplace* asked manufacturers of some of the most stolen cars what was being done to prevent theft. All declined on-camera interviews, but in written statements all agreed that car theft is an issue that affects all brands.

* Toyota, which owns Lexus, wrote that its vehicles comply with all Canadian regulations and that it is continually "developing and deploying new or improved technical features into new models to further strengthen their security."
* Honda wrote that its newer vehicles include keys with an electronic code that makes it "extremely difficult to duplicate," and owners can connect with some vehicles through their smartphones.
* Land Rover said it was the first manufacturer to introduce "UItra Wide Band technology" to thwart relay attacks, and said U.K. industry security experts gave Land Rover vehicles a "superior" security rating.
* Ford said there is "no unique risk" identified for its F-150 vehicles, and suggested parking in secure, lit areas, and making sure vehicles are locked when unattended.

Meanwhile, some manufacturers are looking to implement stronger security measures such as biometrics or two-factor authentication to help curb car theft. Vehicle security companies already have tools that can be added aftermarket at the expense of the consumer, such as a lock for a car's OBD port, extra immobilizers or a personalized code drivers have to enter before the engine will start.

Experts such as Jafar and O'Connor suggest layering security measures is the best way to protect vehicles from being stolen. They say parking vehicles in garages, blocking in vehicles with less desirable cars and looking into aftermarket solutions are all ways that thieves can be thwarted until manufacturers strengthen the security in their vehicles.

"We can't keep up with the way it's going," said O'Connor. "Resources are all over the place. This comes [down] to layers of protection for the vehicle to ensure your vehicle doesn't become targeted."

most of my CRX buddies can all use each others keys but not to my 94 civic.

Most likely the key will not turn the ignition. Only the door.

change the lock - new one would be better, but its bound to do it again. i've seen this geo prizm in high school that u can literally just push on the lock and it pops open. cheap things. lol

You will have to get new lock cylinders from honda. there not to bad $$ and are easy to take out of the door handle. Once you get the lock cylinders......open the phone book look in the yellow pages for lock smiths. Once you find one take the lock cylinder out of the door....... hand the lock smith your old cylinder, new cylinder and maybe your key. They will be able to rekey the new cylinder to your key. Then just pop them back in the door and you are good to go. It shouldn't be more then a few $$ to have them rekeyed

screw replacing the locks..

go keyless!!

the only one to replace is the hatch lock, the main doors are keyless

disconnect the rod that goes to the keycylinder. only problem is if the batt dies you have to crawl through the hatch.

but that isn't too hard.

Yes a pager alarm is more expensive, but its is worth it.

Installing it yourself isn't hard either - so you could save yourself some money and have a proper stealth install

please check out the Security forums for more details.

go get new lock cylinders from honda, they include keys with the new ones, what happened isnt that the key can open any door its that the tumblers inside the lock wore down and any type of pressure will unlock it, correct?

happened all the time at my old work, its pretty easy, u can have a mechnic do it, but it pays 1.2 hours, at prooly 90 bucks an hour, its pretty easy to do yourself,

To add to what a couple others have said already, yes you can open the door with just about any Honda key from that year. And as I found out the other day, many of them actually do start the car as well. My friend got into my car and started it up with his key and then moved it to trick me. Was not very funny! So I am now in the process of going keyless, just to be safe... ![](https://honda-tech.com/forums/images/smilies/emsmile.gif)

## Man-in-the-Middle Attack against Electronic Car-Door Openers

[This](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-birmingham-42132689) is an interesting tactic, and there’s a video of it being used:

> The theft took just one minute and the Mercedes car, stolen from the Elmdon area of Solihull on 24 September, has not been recovered.
>
> In the footage, one of the men can be seen waving a box in front of the victim’s house.
>
> The device receives a signal from the key inside and transmits it to the second box next to the car.
>
> The car’s systems are then tricked into thinking the key is present and it unlocks, before the ignition can be started.

@hmm

i was thinking about this attack on contactless credit card but from what i have read it is not possible because the expected response time is very low and if you put a retransmitter in the middle the response time increase and the attack will not work.

i don’t think that the hint “put the key in a faraday cage” is a good advice.

that’s an epic fail of the producer; they should have thought about this, it’s not that they can sell wireless key and say it’s secure only if you block wireless wtf?!?!?

Here: <https://twitter.com/rootkovska/status/935441674297380864>

there are some comments and research:

-add a button

-low latency

-accelerometer that disable the key if it doesn’t move for a while (far from perfect)

I suspect (but I do not have any “insider” information) that this is just abusing RFID. The first guy’s device (closer to the house) is just emitting an EM field and then the key divulges itself, signal gets picked and relayed the the other device, held by the guy at the car.

Reason is I am saying this is I just saw some “car key pouches” and this reminded me of “RFID pouches”. (It’s probably not RFID, something more proprietary.)

Nearly any physical security with locks and keys acts just as a flag that somebody broke in – mostly just to prevent random bypassers from opening your doors. It acts also as a social norm – if it’s locked and not yours, none of your business.

This kind of attack has became very common in Germany in the recent years. And yes, people started storing their keys at home in metal boxes. Obviously this attack would also work in a parking lot of a store.

The manufacturers have not done anything to avoid this kind of attack – even the most recent cars have this fail. I mean: you can unlock the car with the relay attack, but then you can keep driving forever without the key anywhere close?

I understand that shutting down the car on the Autobahn because communication was lost, is not a good idea and also the battery drain on these keys is probably also an issue.

But maybe after driving the car for 1/4 mile the car starts checking for the key again and only if it makes contact at least once within 2-3 minutes it will allow further driving. That would at least make it harder for a car thief to get far enough away.

@Markus Fritze

apparently yes:

-a friend told me that he had it in his pocket but his dad was going to work, only when he had to come back home he noticed that he haden’t the key (his son had it in the pocket near him in the morning)

-read article of tesla? car: he used phone to unlock the car, he stopped in the middle of nowhere (far from city street) to watch the sunset. he could not turn on anymore the car because no mobile phone network in that area.

i still have “old” key (luckily)

How come there’s no requirement for human activation of the key ?

As we’ve read here many times, security is a trade off against convenience. I have a 2010 Nissan Versa (sub $20k car) with a smart key, and it exhibits the same behavior. Keyfob near the car, and you can unlock the doors (requires pushing a button on the door, but not the key). If I start the car (with the key inside) and then leave with the key, it will stay running.

I suspect that most people want this behavior, and not have to actually interact with the key. Most would see it as a step backward in luxury (i.e. convenience) if the car manufacturers changed the key behavior to be more secure.

That said, they should be able to improve the key identification routine so these kinds of attacks are more difficult.

I do love not having to fish my keys out of my pocket in the dead of winter while carrying two arm-loads of groceries.

Ultimately, we all pay the price for this convenience in the form of higher insurance rates.

@me came to the comments for this, so it’s a relay attack not a man in the middle attack

I remember when garage doors would happily open from a replay attack

When you’re home(or wherever) and the key is going to be in range, lock the car, turn OFF the key. We’ve done this ever since they came out.

You can’t relay it if it isn’t broadcasting. It’s a little extra work, but not that hard.

I have a 2017 Toyota RAV4 and they seem to have figured this out. If I start the vehicle and walk away with the key, the ignition will stay “on”; however, the vehicle will stop and not go anywhere. My wife has “tested” this for me a few times by dropping me off at work and forgetting her keys. I have to go back and giver her my keys before the vehicle will go any further.

RE/ driving wihtout key: My BMW X1 will actually complain (A LOT) if the key is not present IN the car, and eventually turn off at the next chance – read: while not moving. I know because… My wife had the key in her purse. I stopped to drop her off for work on a red traffic light, city center, major road, rush hour. She rushed into work and almost at the same time the car turned off complaining that the key was not present…

Well, after only 5 Minutes of me standing and blocking the road she returned with the key.

Convenience vs. Security. Even with this embarrasment I prefer it this way.

“And all because the lady loved to shop, thus use her bum to open the door”…

Or atleast that’s what the adverts used to show.

There is another issue with these electronic keys on cars. Sometimes the range they will work at is way way way beyond that you might expect.

What feels like years ago now the Top Gear Motoring program demonstrated this with Clarkson putting a key up against his temple and unkocking a car that was a very long way away (think large supermarket car park).

With the newer “passive keys” where the key is in effect a smart RFID trigered by a field the car generates all the time, such a relay attack was a forgone conclusion…

There is by the way no technical solution to such Marketing Madness unless you think a stratigic nutron bomb might not be overly objectionable?

It’s more than that. It has to detect both sides of car, distinguish between them so it knows if key is in the car then prevent you from locking key in car. And it has to prevent you from locking key in trunk, say, extra key in luggage. It has to be able to tell if there is more than one key since you may carry more than one, or passenger may have one as well as the driver. Then it has to be smart even when field varies in strength, orientation. It’s much more than just a smart proximity device.

As soon as you require owner to remove key from pocket and handle key or press button, might as well remove the feature altogether. Similar problems exist with smart front door locks using smart phones, etc. And they’re cost sensitive. If it’s too expensive no one will buy it no matter how well it works.

Then you have to actually design for manufacturing, firmware, pcb, plastic, packaging. Test a million times that it does work when it’s supposed to work. Owners don’t think a whole lot about hackers, but as soon as it acts flaky and they can’t get in their car it’s game over.

Designing a better system is a lot harder then just spewing comments on a blog somewhere. As difficult as it is for you to believe.

I loathe motorcars, in particular those of the type “Potenzersatz” (male virility substitute) peddled in places like S, M, IN, or WOB, so I won’t try to dissimulate too much my schadenfreude… I wouldn’t expect right-hand drives to sell too well even in Kazakhstan, so this one will probably be slaughtered for parts which will then be combined with some wreck (but with a legit VIN) and transformed into a saleable carriage. The economics of the whole business make me wonder, it probably wouldn’t work without very cheap labour.

I found a [Wired article from March 2016](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/study-finds-24-car-models-open-unlocking-ignition-hack/), with an embedded ADAC (Germany’s largest automobile club, a.k.a. the country’s leading political party) video showing essentially the same operation. It’s not clear whether the “surveillance camera” section of the video is an actual theft, or a dramatization.

There is a reference to a [Swiss 2011 paper](http://www.syssec.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/inst-infsec/system-security-group-dam/research/spot/332.pdf), so it’s a bit of old news.

The paper mentions “distance bounding”, i.e., range limitation. I looked up patents, and found a fair level of activity in that particular area over the last 5-6 years (apparently dominated with filings from South Korea), so the question is why there isn’t a workable solution yet.

I hate these electronic keys/key fobs. When I could I opted for the cheaper car without them. I recently bought a new Subaru and this time I was forced to accept them because there wasn’t an option without.

Why are we so lazy we can no longer manually turn a key in a lock?

Can the key code be relayed to a device that will save the code, thus enabling duplication?

1/4 mile is enough to drive a few blocks and load the car onto a flatbed carrier.

“I am going to work this out. Computer!”. Remember, Motorsport is no longer a paradox with a self driving car on the autobahn. Because of complexity, the driver mitigates the risk of not being “fully asleep” to the manufacturer which in this case is the human element. i can see the car as the bed in a hotel with a receptionist: if i get to it, i can sleep my way to the destination as long as i trust the luggage person(MITM), travel light, or never leave the the auto…mode. The human element is required to make progress. Without it, we are agreeing to compete on whose car/bed/auto is more automatic. Utopically, the only way to test this topic is through the ability to remember if i was “fully asleep”-a new type of sport safe from (MITM). “Define legislation Computer”. Legislation is the key. Until a hitchhiker- another type of MITM. Hu ⚛️

I remembered the story of the guy who found that his house door key matched his car key:) That’s awfully convenient. How long before someone implements this?

@Tatütata,

Around here, we call it ‘stripping’. Just the other day, I saw a car set up on bricks and blocks, stripped of all 4 wheels. It was a relatively busy residential area. Cars are like cows for the strippers; all parts are used, even the body panels can be cut out and saved. New replacement parts for luxury cars are eye-wateringly expensive, hence the demand. Given legit labor and parts costs (and legal risks), it’s not a low wage business. RH and LH drive systems use many common parts, and chassis designs are identical for both.

@ albert,

> Just the other day, I saw a car set up on bricks and blocks, stripped of all 4 wheels.

I saw the same a couple of years back just up the road from one of those gospel missions that have sprung up all over London were,the faithful can be fleeced.

It was parked outside a house who’s owner I was on a nodding/how yer doing basis, and he happend to be having a smoke whilst leaning on the wall. I said hello and we got to chatting about the weather then the expensive motor up on bricks. He said it’s the Pastor’s and thumb pointed over his shoulder at the mission building. I asked if somebody had jacked it whilst the Pastor was preaching and was told no he did it himself… A statment that just was begging for a follow up question or three.

It turns out the Pastor who’s a bit of a slipper charecter with the mission funds and other monies and payed special devotional attention to some of the younger yews ib his flock, had gone on an all expenses paid fact finding mission to the US for a couple of weeks. Further that the Pastor didn’t trust people so rather than park it in the garage where he lived he’d parked it up on bricks and covered it with a cover so it would not get “taken”[1]. Well I noticed immediately that the cover was gone, so I asked, and was told that some of the local kids had been seen carrying a bundle of the same coloured plastic. I half jokingly said “how long do you reckon before they strip it?” he thought for a moment or two before saying that he reckoned the only thing the pastor would have left by the time he got back would be the wheels locked up in the misson and laughed.

Turned out he was a little optomistic, somebody broke in the mission that night and stole the wheels, put them back on the car and pulled it up on a low loader and disappeared off into the night.

Apparently it was not the repo men but somebody else, as the repo men came looking a week later…

Not sure if the Pastor ever came back from the US, as the mission had a new one shortly after. Who was not so much of the “hell and damnation” if you don’t fill the collection box type, and a lot quieter in his sermons, and had a wife to keep him on the straight and narrow.

A few weeks after that I got chatting with the guy that owned the house and said it was quite funny in a way. To which he replied smiling “You know God moves in mysterious ways” befor nodding and saying “It couldn’t happen to a more diserving man… No it sure couldn’t” before laughing a lot. I guess he didn’t like the Pastor much either.

[1] If I remember rightly the actuall word was “repo’d”.

My older Subaru has both a key and an electronic fob. The key is absolutely required to start the engine, the doors can be unlocked/locked with either. But there’s a catch.

The alarm system can *only* be disarmed with the fob.

It being an older car, the battery contacts in the keyfob are a bit worn and dirty. Sometimes the pushbutton doesn’t do anything. No big deal, I thought, the first time this happened. Unlocked the door with the key, got in, and the alarm immediately sounded. I’m trying everything while the horn is blaring, but even the key in the ignition switch didn’t stop it. Finally after much varied fob-button pushing, it mercifully silenced.

Sigh.

At least the bad guys can’t start the engine with a replay attack. (Not that the car is worth the effort, probably.)

My mother has the fob and a friend was driving the car. She dropped my mom at the door and went to find a parking spot. The car stopped and the horn started honking and lights flashing.

But in this case the device just took over for the fob. So right not a MITM but it emulated the fob and fooled the car into believing that the fob was close by.

Solution. Drive an old car.

Some related anecdotes:

Here in Washington state we have had problems on the ferry system with theft detection systems that disable the car (fancy european cars and especially those “reach” BMW rentals) if the vehicle is moved without the key present, preventing a thief from loading the car onto a flatbed or just towing it away. But anyway, the problem is that owners found themselves unable to start the car when the ferry docked. Total pain in the ass for everyone, repeated delays to the entire ferry system while they bring in a tow truck to get the disabled vehicle out of the way.

Also on the ferry system here, routine (and routinely ignored) announcements to owners to remember to disable motion sensor alarms. I vote they announce that any passengers should feel free to key any vehicle with an alarm going off. That might fix the problem.

A friend couldn’t figure out how to lock his (fancy) rental car. He would lock it, but then when he tried the door to verify it was locked, it would open right up. Took a while until I pointed out that this was a “feature” not a “bug” – he had a proximity key, and since the key was in his pocket, of course it opened the door for him. I thought it was funny, but he failed to see the humor. 🙂

@ thiefhunter,

> Can the key code be relayed to a device that will save the code, thus enabling duplication?

The answer is “it depends”.

Obviously the key and the lock share a common secret, that they are paired by.

Back in the old days the key just transmitted the actual common secret over and over and over. Some garage door openers still work this way. Thus yes record the code then retransmit it and the lock would open.

Slightly later versions used a rolling code system thus each time you pressed the button the next code would be transmitted. They solved the code replay sort of, but introduced a whole bucket load of synchronisation problems… Which you could write a book about.

So the next trick was to use a cipher system. The key transmitter would send out a signal to wake up the lock, which would transmit back a –supposadly– random number that the key encrypted with the secret and transmitted back to the lock. The lock would decrypt it with the secret and if the decrypted number matched the random number then the lock opened. Early systems used weak random number generation and stream ciohers… Thus were subject to replay with “bit flipping” attacks.

The RFID type proximity systems work the other way around. The lock transmitts a random number, the key fob picks it up encrypts it with the secret and transnitts the ciphertext back to the lock. The lock decrypts and compares and if the number is the same unlocks. They tend not to use a stream cipher but a “secret sauce” block cipher, which might not be very strong at all. The reason being that the fob is effectively powered by the EM field put out by the lock which is going to be at best in the microwatts of power at the limits of the range.

Thus if the secret sauce has been reverse engineered and analysed weak crypto would enable some form of recovery.

However… In some the lock would keep transmitting the same supposadly random number untill the lock unlocked… As the block length was short (16-20bits) it was feasible to just transmitt all bit patterns in sequence till the lock unlocked…

Thus you could say “If there was an incorrect way to do crypto, then the electronic car lock chip designers had probavly already tried it and found it did not work prior to going onto their next failure…

The reason this happens is good crypto is CPU cycle intensive and each CPU cycle takes a finite amount of energy. Thus good crypto drains batteries at many many times the rate of bad cpu cycle saving crypto… Further designing a fob with a changable battery is a lot lot more expensive than designing one that is not changeable… So a lot of money can be saved going down the bad crypto route. Beter yet customers don’t have to be changing batteries twice a year, which also means less “fat thumb syndrome” of broken or forced battery contacts and covers leading to replacment costs and technician time for re-pairing of a fob to lock…

Speaking of which some car manufactures based the secret on the VIN number which people can read off of the window, dash board etc. So if an attacker knows the algorith then making a fake fob key is the work of moments…

That such weaknesses are put into the second most expensive thing people buy (ie house first, car second…). Suggests that the car manufacturers are trying to minimalise or externalise the cost of crypto failure. But you should ask “do they care?” the answer is no. Because to them any car stolen and stripped/vandalised/exported is just a new sale to them.

Think about that carefully, their implementation of weak security means increased sales thus profits, thus quaterly targets etc… So where is the incentive to make things to strong?..

*Back in the old days the key just transmitted the actual common secret over and over and over. Some garage door openers still work this way. Thus yes record the code then retransmit it and the lock would open.*

A friend asked me circa 2005 to take a look at a remote control for his building’s underground garage.

I found inside a Motorola [MC145030](http://www.datasheetarchive.com/MC145030-datasheet.html) encoder/decoder, a 9-dipswitch block, and a few odd transistors and coils forming a 433MHz ASK or OOK transmitter.

All switches were still set in the default position… (All zeros or all ones, whatever).

Replacement remotes were still offered for sale at that time. Probably still are as of late 2017…

*But anyway, the problem is that owners found themselves unable to start the car when the ferry docked.*

That would be an alternative explanation for the opening scene of Polanski’s “[The Ghost [Writer]](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139328/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_5)“, where a BMW wouldn’t start upon arriving on the ferry from Martha’s Vineyard (actually Sylt). I liked that flick, although it was one big product placement from start to finish.

A solution would be to install a pin pad to get the vehicle started (2-factor authentication). We are so accustomed to entering pins that one more to get the vehicle started is not that much of a hassle. Stops these replay attacks dead in the water, does not stop thieves from entering the car with a replay attack.

A friend of mine claims to know two cars his electronic key works for. Which would be a strong hint for really weak random numbers being used. Anyway:

If your car stopped abruptly as soon as your key is jammed/broken that would be an security issue. I once drove a car whose error memory apparently wasn’t a ring buffer but stopped abruptly every few minutes if a head light with a bad contact had filled it with “light is broken/Light works” messages. Which in the middle of a motorway was quite scary.

---

There was an question about relaying wireless credit cards. In the German press there were reports from scientists who claim to have done it. You cannot relay the data via cell phone as the ping time is too high, but apparently by other (lower latency) means of RF transfer. And I would be inclined to believe that it wouldn’t be too hard to take a wireless card reader to a party and to read all the cards you manage to come near to.

It is not a mere “replay” attack, but a true man-in-the-middle attack capable of intercepting or deducing the secret key and then emulating the rolling codes, allowing the attacker to escalate his privilege to that of the keyholder. This is possible because today’s fancier car keys or key fobs are now both transmitters and receivers, and they do employ crypto, but have implemented their key exchange protocols poorly.

Correction, a purely analog implementation would be sufficient to achieve this effect on keyless vehicles. Basically it greatly extends the physical distance whereby the key’s proximity to the vehicle will allow it to open and start.

@ James,

> So I guess the mitigation is to store your key in a metal container overnight…

If it’s an effective Faraday screen, which might well not be.

But as I noted above,

*There is by the way no technical solution to such Marketing Madness unless you think a stratigic nutron bomb might not be overly objectionable?*

All real world solutions have edge and corner cases even when you think them through carefully.

Any RF engineer will tell you that all analog RF systems have bandwidth, and as long as you can filter to that bandwidth and the correct center frequency you can amplify the transmitted signal to any reasonable level thus range.

So an analog repeater will work from anywhere around the world if other precautions are not taken.

Thus you have to try and figure out the range of the keyfob.

There are two basic ways to do this currently and both have their problems. The first is to get two or more barings on the transmitter, which is the old way used for Direction Finding. However in the case of the analog repeater it will only tell you where the repeater transmitter is not the key fob. The second is a little like radar, you send out a timing mark and check the return path delay to get a range for the key fob. The problem is that the finer you want the range information the greater the bandwidth required. Usually wide bandwidth is a big no no in spectrum allocation.

However there are a couple of exceptions Spread Spectrum systems such as Direct sequence(DSSS) and Frequency hopping(FHSS) and what are called Ultra Wide Bandwidth (UWB) systems such as Carrier free UWB (DS-UWB) and Multiband OFDM (MBOFDM).

All of these systems have their own issues DS-UWB is effectively a modern version of the Spark Gap Transmitter developed by Victorian Gentleman Natural Philosophers with ultra short duration transmission pulses, thus putting fractional amounts of energy across the ‘DC to Microwave’ spectrum or some chosen harmonic of it.

The actual solution will almost certainly end up being a variation of the ranging codes and direction finding, but I suspect that will not happen to quite some time after UWB IoT systems and UWB wirless USB bring the on chip technology down to a few cents.

It realy all depends on how smart the blackhat ebgineers are who design the repeaters for the car thieves. When it comes to luxury cars and their spare parts there will always be “other channels” to buy especially with the premium prices manufacturers want. Mark ups of 2-30 thousand percent are a direct invitation to car theives. Even basic mass produced car parts at a 1000 percent markup are still sufficient margin, after all it’s that sort of margin that happily keeps legitimate breakers yards in business.

Modern garage doors allow one of the remote controls to be “cloned” into the remote buttons in the car (usually the rear-view mirror). This is done by operating the remote while the car “listens” to it. But the original remote still works, even if not used for several months after being cloned. How do theses systems work, security-wise, in light of possible rotating codes, etc.?

I had a look at one of the Mercedes “Keyless-Go” systems to see if there are any simple defences against the relay attack.

The apparent components of the system are the car, the key and an engine starter button in the steering column where the key normally goes. The starter button is about 40mm in diameter and about 10mm-30mm deep. The business end of the key is a solid block, about 10mm x 20mm, it is not a traditional mechanical key.

The trick to working out how to disable the “Keyless-Go” feature (and thus the relay attack) is looking carefully at the starter button and key. The key is that same physical design as “normal” Mercedes keys, it has a flat area at the end that appears to be made of an infrared transparent material. The usual way you use it it to touch the door handle, and if the key is in your pocket it opens. Then press the starter button and you can drive off.

The starter button can be removed from the steering column, which exposes a slot for the key, which is the same physical design as a non-Keyless Mercedes. The “keyway” appears to have an infrared transparent area, about 3mm in diameter. In the non keyless car, the key is paired to the engine Electronic Control Unit, and there is some sort of challeng/response when you insert the key in the keyway. (Put the wrong key in and you get an error message). You can plug the key directly into the keyway and use it like a normal key – turn the key and the engine starts. If you remove the starter button the only way to start the car is with the key. (We’ll ignore the onboard diagnostic port … )

My hypothesis is that Mercedes have taken the standard design and added the starter button is an RF-to-IR transceiver, and that it’s purpose is to relay the challenge-response from the Engine Control Unit to the key over RF. (At a guess this is a standardisation/cost saving thing as I believe early implementations had a dedicated starter button on the dashboard.) The advantage is you can remove the starter button, which disables the keyless function.

The obvious weakness is a black hat hacker could engineer a module that goes in the keyway and performs the relay function. Basically a (slightly) more sophisticated version of the current relay attack which looks like it is RF relay / amplification.

I’m not even convinced its a useful feature. Hertz gave me a car with a keyless feature and it served mainly to confuse my mental model of “where” is the car key. I know to take key out of steering column and put it in my pocket when parking. When it is keyless, I don’t have a standard place to keep the key when driving.

PKE works this way: You approach or touch car. It emits a low power 125kHz signal that triggers the key fob in your pocket to transmit the unlock code. Flaw in the thinking is that the security depends on the low power of the 125kHz transmission.

Receiving the 125kHz signal near the car and re-transmitting it at a high power will trigger the keyfob to send the unlock signal, and if the keyfob is within range of the car, it will unlock the car.

The attack works just as well when you are walking from your car into a supermarket.

I don’t think that it has to be a store and forward attack, if you can build an analog receiver/transmitter that doesn’t go into a feedback look – a short delay or even a phase shift would do that.

Faraday cage (we use a silver tea caddy) does work and you can demonstrate this by walking up to the car with your Faraday cage with the keyfob inside and seeing if you can unlock the car.

It’s not as reliable but putting the keyfob in your pocket next to your mobile phone may work since there is enough RF coming out of your phone to potentially disrupt the keyfob’s transmission.

Now, if the same technique can be used to make the car think the key is inside, you can start it and drive off. None of cars prevent you driving off without the key inside.

@ Amplector,

> Could blockchain somehow be applied to secure something like this?

The answer to the “somehow” is probably yes, but there are way better ways to secure such systems. Especially when you consider the work factor in CPU cycles and thus battery life…

Contrary to what some blockchain devotees believe the blockchain is very much not the first soloution to any kind of security or authentication issue. There appears to be a race on for people to get their name associated with some kind of blockchain solution as though it’s a must have on a C.V.

At it’s simplest a block chain is a simple often linked list of records in groups or blocks where a cryptographic hash of a previous block is in effect the IV for the next block to be hashed with. Thus the hash chain is in effect a running key cipher with all the issues that involves.

But there are hidden issues that need to be resolved such as the temporal or sequence order of not just the blocks but the records within them. Thus some people make the block size be a single timestamped record and try to eliminate any kind of distributed state. Because the timestamp is a real thorny issue in any kind of system with two or more communicating nodes as for various laws of physics reasons the time at one node is not the same as the time at an observing node. Thus a three or more node system will have an irreconcilable issue with ordering records with those kept at the other nodeI’ve read about blockchain being the future of securing IoT devicess (look up “relativistic light cones” for a simple explanation)…

The last thing you want if record ordering is of importance is to have to introduce special relativity into your nodes as they have to do in GPS navigation systems and various communications networks such as those used in GSM mobile phone networks.

Thus the likes of High Frequency Trading where contract time and order are paramount get extreamly complex temporally. This will get worse as blockchains get used for contracts and similar…

For instance lets assume my trading point is in the same room as the contract arbitrage system, but your trade point is 1000Km away. I can send you a contract which you sign and send into the arbitrage system. Meanwhile I’ve sent a copy of the contract to the arbitrage system that is different. However it arives at the arbitrage system before you signed contract arives. When it comes to reconcilliation I can claim the contract you signed is not the final contract I sent you as that is the way it appears in the arbitrage blockchain… If you do not work this out within the actual protocol you are going to have lots of lawyers bills in your future…

As for,

> I’ve read about blockchain being the future of securing IoT devices

I’d look for more informed writing by the likes of an embedded systems designer who has worked in the complex communication of embedded devices for a decade or two. Unfortunately you will find they realy are quite thin on the ground… Which is why I can forsee the rise of IoT security issues that make the history of WiFi look tame…

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

You should really try and get that person fired. That is an unbelievable level of incompetence and that response is just insulting. So sorry this happened to you. It must be tempting to just douse it in gas and give it a cleansing fire.

The attendant is just there to collect money and make sure no one parks for free. They don't care about what happens to your car. Heck, the back of the ticket basically says "We don't care what happens to your car, and won't give you any money if anything does happen to it. Park at your own risk."

Talk to a lawyer. This may be gross negligence, which the standard writing on the back of a parking slip does not cover. It’s their lot and they do actually have some liability for things that happen there.

When I opened the door the first time
my immediate dread was a soup kitchen
had gone down.

No lie.
Because homeless people come to the stair wells of the lot to have sex and this car would be a step up.

Am I not seeing something? Because there is nothing in this picture that remotely makes it look trashed. I imagine it would be of course with a homeless person breaking in and living in there but it doesn’t look bad in this picture.

happened this weekend.

Upon arriving back from a trip, I discovered my car was broken into and completely trashed. The police wouldn’t come because there was no one in it and it was considered non-emergency.
Told me report online. Called insurance, said they’d follow up on Monday.

Then, this morning my neighbor banged on my door, waking me up to tell me “someone’s in your car right now!”

They already called the cops.

I got dressed and walked up the lot calmly with mercy (my golden baseball bat) just as a means to keep whoever it was at a distance. Not beat anyone. I opened the door and she looked at me like “...you have the audacity to open my door.”

Yeah, she’s a woman. She broke into the car from the other side facing the railing, thru the window so it appeared fine on the other side to passerby’s.

She was putting pants on when I opened the door. There were panties, other people’s I.D.s and other clothing on the floor.

The car reeks so badly of smoke, beer and urine i couldn’t get in. She was pantless at first, had a plate full of cigarette butts and a pipe on the seat like a bed rest. Also discovered she peed in the car behind the driver seat and put the seats down to lay out, tossing everything in my trunk all around the car, somewhere in the process pouring bleach I had I. The back for laundry, on the seats and floor. She had a makeup thing that blew up in the drivers seat too.

I said quietly but shaking with anger, “why? Why would you break into and make your home in a perfectly good condition car? There are so many services in this area to help you, to give you a home, why? Do you know what it’ll cost for me to fix this?”

She said ,”I have a place, I’ll pay. (Incoherent)”.
And got annoyed, started rambling.

I yelled ,” YOU RUINED MY CAR!!!”
She responded incoherently.
I slammed the door and locked her in.

The cops arrive about 5 seconds after that.

They asked who’s car it was, I said mine and immediately they swerved over and got out of the car.

Pull guns, “GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!”
I stepped out in front and said, “WHOA! I just talked to her, she’s an older homeless woman, she’s not armed.” They told me to step back.

I told them guns were not necessary I’d get her out if needed. They scolded me but I said I was just informing them of the situation before they escalated it based on having no info. I saw police here kill a homeless man on Hope St. just two months prior.

She got arrested and struggled and cursed.
Cops told me they can’t prove she was the one who broke in. It’s technically not a crime to sit in someone’s car.... yeah

They said they would “try” to charge her with vandalism and burglary because the car was damaged and $10 was missing from the car.

There’s more but this is long.
Gonna need a new window, body work (door is dented badly) and a deep clean so fresh the hell will smell the lemons.

This post is partially just to help me process it as I find it both infuriating and hilarious (dirty mike irl) that I come home from a vacay I took intentionally to relieve stress, to this. Could be worse. A huge inconvenience and cost, but could be worse.

Yikes. Sorry that happened to you. This recently happened to our neighbor’s house - it had sold and they were moved out and were waiting on closing. During that time, a person moved in and moved some furniture in and parked in their garage. They were living there like it was their house. The place was wrecked but they had set flowers out on the kitchen counter 😂

I should have recorded the whole interaction.

I was very calm at first until she started trying to defend herself instead of apologizing.

I asked her specifically “why did you break in my car” ... her response was, “I didn’t know it was your car I was scared.” I can’t remember exactly what else she said but she definitely admitted it.

I just didn’t want to record the whole interaction as it seemed unnatural and in my mind I was like “that’s too IG and this is real life”.

Jurisdiction between districts in LA is an absolute nightmare altogether. BHPD is rather hilariously bored- and hyper vigilant as a result. If you’re north of Wilshire you can expect them in like a minute and a half if you call. My grandparents have a house in the flats so I’ve had some experiences with them. I’ll never forget about how hyped up they got during the riots in ‘92 when there was a window of fear that the riot would actually breach the entirety of the city, all the way to Beverly Hills. We lived in weho and were scared, which retrospectively is a bit silly but the riots were terrifying (also I was 6 so the whole city being on fire was totally plausible in my mind). BHPD were like “YES, FINALLY WE GET TO USE OUR GEAR!”. All suited up with nowhere to go, lol. Another fave is when I was 17 and one of my best friends lived on Camden. We had been taking a fashion design class at OTIS and were up super late working on our final project so we decided to take a walk along Rodeo to get some air and maybe some design inspiration. We’d been on Rodeo for about 90 seconds when 2 cop cars pulled up to us and asked what we were up to, if they could “help us” etc. They were young guys and after we explained what we were doing and that we were local they spent like 5 minutes shooting the shit and flirting with us. It was very silly. Don’t trust that courthouse though, I once paid a ticket in person and they never fucking filed it so I unknowingly drove around with a suspended license for 2 whole years. Literally didn’t know until I tried to renew it.

> Rodeo Drive (the famous part, at least) is protected by the Beverly Hills Police Department.

I'm aware of the on-paper jurisdictions. And yet LAPD still spent resources protecting non-LA cities while parts of LA were left to burn.

> During this period, **the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies abandoned Koreatown**, a rectangular area which covers about 150 blocks between Eighth Street and Irolo Street, west of MacArthur Park.[68] Koreans had begun settling in the Mid-Wilshire area in the 1960s after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. It was here that many opened successful businesses.[69]
>
> As the riots spread, roads between Koreatown and wealthy white neighborhoods were blocked off by police and **official defense lines were set up around the independent cities such as Beverly Hills and West Hollywood.**

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Los_Angeles_riots#Day_2_%E2%80%93_Thursday,_April_30>

Basically, you're describing what they should've done. I'm describing what they did.

LAPD abandoned South Central and Koreatown to burn, in order to defend Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, even though the latter are separate municipalities while the former are parts of the City of LA. Because BH and WeHo were/are rich, and South Central and Ktown were/are not. They showed where their true loyalties lie, and it wasn't necessarily to those within the geographical borders of the City of LA, even though that's who they ostensibly work for.

I'm with you, but this is also precisely why cops shouldn't try to dissuade victims from seeking charges against people. I've had a cop try to skip out on filing a report for a break in because not enough was stolen in terms of raw dollar amount to constitute a felony, but I wasn't having that, I needed the report regardless for insurance.

Yeah that’s exactly what he tried to do.

He was like “I mean you just need the window fixed right? How much will that cost.”

I said nah...
this damage is a minimum of $5000.

Some people severely underestimate how expensive it is to repair a car, even what is seemingly minor damage. If a fender bender can be close to $900, I can't imagine how much it will cost to repair all of that damage.

Best of luck with all of that.

I stopped at a stop sign a year ago in my sedan and the lady behind me in her Land Rover was on her phone and hit me. She couldn't have been going more than 1 or 2 mph but because her bumper was so much higher than mine, it hit it in such a way that it not only severely dented the bumper but also the trunk door, which then couldn't close completely. It ended up costing like $3,500.

General rule of thumb is that if the damage is visible and beyond a minor scratch, expect to pay a minimum $750 to return to new condition.

I had my catalytic converter stolen a few months back and the cops (over the phone - they would not come out) marked it as "under $500." Total cost before insurance was $2800. So yeah... they're cops, not claim adjusters. (And the job they do as cops is.....questionable)

Eh Cops are human beings so it really is a case by case basis.

There are cops who take their job as protector very seriously and there are cops who use that power for their own profit. I'd say a cop could either be your enemy or friend depending on the person.

I have friends who are EMTs and they tell me they generally don't see people as individual humans, they see them as the trauma they have to treat. Kind of a coping mechanism to get through brutal days. I think, even based on my limited interactions as a law-abiding citizen and infrequent victim of crime, that even the "good" police tend to cope the same way. I doubt you could deal with the crap they see constantly and maintain high levels of empathy and not burn out. This is no excuse for them to be shitty to people, but I think it explains why the typical range of human behavior doesn't hold as well for them and a lot come off as shitty to victims. And these are the police who are normal people and not criminal, half-baked walnuts.

I recently had a window smashed out by a man with a machete and while the cops were way more chill with me than I had expected, it was also apparent they were going to do absolutely nothing and didn't even pretend that I wasn't an inconvenience. I'm fine, and I'm sure they're great with their spouses and kids, but if they were bartenders they weren't going to get a tip. :)

(In before someone else misses the point- I'm not saying they have to be customer service reps in order for me to give them money, it's an admittedly weak analogy)

My EMT instructor told us to treat the meat, which sounds brutally necessary and practical until you encounter your first psychiatric patient. His co-instructor emphasized kindness above all, which (along with treatment) is difficult to provide to a flailing shrieker when you're distracted by concern for your own safety.

IMO, first responders really aren't provided enough training in interacting with the mentally ill. And too many responders start out with a dearth of inherent kindness, and then have the gall blame "burnout" for abusive behavior.

I have several friends who are firefighters and cops, and the attitude is pretty universal. You have to be able to compartmentalize to do the job.

One of my firefighter friends said that when he was first on the job and they had to go on a call with an injured child (drowning, car accident, etc) he would go home after his shift and break down in tears because he just couldn't handle seeing kids hurt like that. He is like 6'4"- 260, played football in college, etc. - not the kind of "man" you would expect to not be able to handle it. He's been a firefighter for over 10 years now, and he did get counseling and is better, but still HATES having to go out on calls with kids.

My friend who is LAPD says that he has to think the same way, or he wouldn't be able to do his job.

I encourage everyone to do some research on [Vicarious Trauma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_traumatization) It is a very real, and difficult thing for people who are first responders, social workers, therapists, etc.

The other day my wife was walking to the train and this crazy was throwing garbage at passing cars and people. A driver got out and chased him away, while two Seattle PD were sitting across the street not doing a god damn thing. And don’t call the nearest station, they will just tell you to call 911 where the dispatcher puts the call at the bottom because its a crazy. Fucking useless.

I could be way off but from my understanding, "trespass" is generally limited to property related to land like fields, domiciles or the curtilage thereof. Infringing on OP's property rights of their car would technically be considered "trespass to chattels" (or "conversion" if the car is in such bad shape that it is no longer useable), which is only a civil claim rather than a criminal claim.

There are probably other criminal laws that the person violated but I don't think trespass is one of them.

Yeah I was trying to explain to the insurance that the car is unsalvageable. She peed in it and smoked crack in it. Lived in it for at least 5 days as a lot attendant said he saw her in there Wednesday (yet did nothing). I just want it gone so I can get a new one and carry on. It feels like it’s not my car anymore sadly.

Crazy thing is - this is a county lot.

There is a camera - doesn’t work. Police park here throughout the day and pass thru constantly before 6pm. Neighborhood security comes thru the lot at least 5 times a day on bike and in cars into the night.

When I was talking them I was literally holding back blerting out “what good are you?”. But I don’t care. Just wanted her out so I could move on.

If there’s a silver lining, it’s that this’ll be one hell of a story to tell next time you’re having dinner with a bunch of people who don’t live in LA.

Ha, how naive. She's old and a lady, must be safe! Or she is a crackhead that possibly has other mental health issues and flies into a full on psychotic episode after a years long binge, stabbing you with what she has nearby; an HIV infected piece of glass.

Are you fully insured or liability only? Your insurance would likely salvage the car or at least help you... if you have AAA you could tow it to somewhere for a deep clean detail

Also, you can’t expect them to charge her when you literally just told them she is harmless and that you would get her out yourself.

To review: Someone else calls the police because there’s a homeless person in their neighbor’s car. Police arrive and owner of the car tells them to back off, and that the person is just a harmless old lady.

So what are the police supposed to do?

Let’s not forget you also confirmed with the police that there was no one in the car previously, when you originally reported it to them, so who is to say it wasn’t a completely different homeless person in there prior? A different homeless person could have easily been the one to make the mess. This one could have stumbled upon it and made herself comfortable after and like they said, that’s not a crime.

> Pull guns, “GET OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!” I stepped out in front and said, “WHOA! I just talked to her, she’s an older homeless woman, she’s not armed.”

This was them trying to escalate the situation to have her do something reckless so they could charge her with a felony. You prevented them from doing this. Is how they responded good? No, but as the lone cop in the thread rightly said, there's no direct evidence she broke into your car, and Prop 47 reduced all of the things she did to your car to misdemeanors. Their behavior was trying to get past that uncomfortable fact.

> They said they would “try” to charge her with vandalism and burglary because the car was damaged

The car has thousands of dollars of damage. There's no question that she committed a felony... if someone spends the time and money to prove the smoke and pee was hers. If you follow up on this with insurance and the police, she might go to jail, but likely not, because it's not like they'll spend the money to do a DNA test. Jail is unfortunately the best current option for all involved, including her. (We can pretend social services can handle her, but they'll deem her not a threat and just release her quickly, which does nobody any good.)

Insurance should cover everything including having to pay somebody to throw away all that garbage. It might’ve been better if they stole your car so you can claim it a total loss and get a check to buy a new car.

Edit: you will have to pay a deductible though, usually $500 or $1k depending on which policy you purchased

<https://goo.gl/maps/ynuALPB8VaNK6nnL6> is where OP was parked, which is the top-level of the LA County Dept. of Social Services garage, located in a very active area of the Arts District. That is a curious choice for a parking spot while on vacation (does OP work there?), but hey, still shouldn't have happened... anywhere.

...while it is not okay that it happened anywhere, like you said, parking a few blocks away from Skid Row on top of the food stamp office is not the safest for a long term parking set up.

Few things about orange county: The same day California approved more funding for homeless shelters a large homeless camp near Angel stadium by the dry cement river was bulldozed. The homeless just moved to the other side.

There's very little homeless support, by design, in OC. Homeless people are bussed out to LA frequently and it's been a criminalized in several upscale cities. You can call to have someone picked up if you see them sleeping out.

I have a friend who had their car stolen in LA and it sounds like it was in a similar state after a few days. The insurance company decided to total the car instead of attempt to clean it. We suspect the cost to get the smells out and potential risks from remnant drug paraphernalia made the insurance company just not want to deal with an ongoing issues.

Rookie Officer: "welp chief we found him covered in blood, on top of the murder victim STILL holding on to the knife that was stuck in the victims chest, should we book em for murder?"

​

Chief "nah, whos to say that someone else didnt murder this guy, and then he came along, covered himself in blood because it looks cool and then grabbed the knife to pull it out. It's literally an unprovable case... Cant solve them all Rook."

Rookie Officer: "well we could fingerprint the knife, check the blood for his DNA since he cut himself, canvas the area for cameras that saw something"

​

Chief "listen, greenhorn, I said its UNPROVABLE."

I was just going to say that. So many cars parked in SFs with signs on them "DON'T BREAK WINDOW. CAR IS UNLOCKED" because so many homeless break the windows to sleep in the cars at night. So utterly terrible that people have to deal with that... and that the homeless have to or decide to resort to that.

Yeah the homeless "advocates" who've really come out in force here and on the San Francisco subreddit lately are going to avoid this thread like the plague since it doesn't reinforce their narrative that the homeless are down on their luck average humans priced out of the city they lived in all their lives.

No one has a retort for a picture of a bat shit crazy drug addict who pisses on their own "bed" and breaks into people's cars.

Glad that the cops assumed that OP on his way to a baseball game with his golden baseball bat "Mercy." If they were jerks, about OP giving them advice about how to handle the situation, the cops may have been able to pin OP with "possession of a deadly weapon with intent to assault."

We need to be honest that they're a mixed bag if we're gonna come up with solutions for the crisis. We can't pretend they're all innocent, down on their luck, and just in need of cheap housing and a break. We also can't pretend they're all mentally unhinged and addicted to drugs.

The city's official stance at the moment seems to be "they're all innocent and in need of a break." Thus, we pretend housing tents around the city are gonna take care of problems like this.

Agreed, I was more on the compassionate side, until I have seen WTF is going on in this city. Look at the syringes, condoms, and poop on the streets of what was once America's most beautiful city, San Francisco? Look at the tent encampments under every overpass or pretty much anywhere in LA! Do you know who does a good job? Beverly Fucking Hills! Go to Weho or WLA, and they are everywhere, I don't know how they do it...

I just watched an article about similar changes in Seattle. Nobody really has a good solution, it's either "stick all these people in free apartments at great expense" or "run them out of the city".

Also, it seems like Beverly Hills and WeHo just keep them out of public view. My cousin was working on a high-end retail space in WeHo and a homeless guy was living in their building and shitting in the alley. They moved him out and apparently he moved into another construction site down the street.

Why do you want to have a different key? Its either in your pocket or stuck 90% of the way ib your ignition, no one will ever see it

If keys were interchangeable then thieves wouldn't need to break into anyone's car. They could just unlock it and drive away.

**Re: Honda civic keys(96-00)**

I believe vehicles made between 88-00 are all the same blanks before the larger keys were applied to all Honda/Acura models.

![](http://www.homedepot.com/catalog/productImages/300/a5/a51be5f2-916c-4fb8-a552-6d03dd04e4ac_300.jpg)

This is what I got from Homedepot to make like 4 copies of my key for my 99 Civic. #27r

[http://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Hillm...specifications](http://www.homedepot.com/p/The-Hillman-Group-27R-Blank-Rubber-Head-Honda-Acura-Key-87017-0/202273655#specifications)

Here's the larger key I mentioned above.

So for example: 97-01 CRV, 94-01 Integra 97-01 Prelude, 1998-2004 Odyssey. Their complete generation still retain the old style keys until the newer models were made, but the large blanks were already being applied.

large Blank:

I could be wrong, just basing the info off personal experience .

Essentially, Honda/Acura blanks are the same depending on the generation.

If you're driving a Honda Civic manufactured between 2016 and 2020, this newly reported key fob hijack should start your worry engine.

Keyless entry exploits are nothing new. Anyone armed with the right equipment can sniff out a lock or unlock code and retransmit it. This particular issue with some Honda vehicles is just the latest demonstration that auto manufacturers haven't adapted their technology to keep up with known threats.

This security weakness, tagged [CVE-2022-27254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27254), was discovered by Ayyappan Rajesh, a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and someone with the handle HackingIntoYourHeart. Their [research](https://github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254) indicated that Honda Civic LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, and Type R vehicles manufactured between 2016 and 2020 all have this vulnerability.

According to the duo, who thanked professors Hong Liu and Ruolin Zhou and mentor Sam Curry, "various Honda vehicles send the same, unencrypted RF signal for each door-open, door-close, boot-open and remote start. This allows for an attacker to eavesdrop on the request and conduct a replay attack."

The GitHub page created for the vulnerability hosts three separate proof-of-concept videos showcasing their results. Essentially, it's shown that you can wait nearby for an owner to wirelessly open or start their vehicle, record that signal over the air, and later on you transmit that data again to perform the same action for yourself.

Attackers only needed a few easily sourced components to execute their attack: a laptop, the GNURadio development toolkit, Gqrx software-defined radio (SDR) receiver software, access to the FCCID.io website, and a HackRF One SDR. The only cost associated with the attack (besides owning a laptop) is purchasing the [HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/), which retails in the mid-$300 range. All software used in the attack is free and open source.

### A common problem

The CVE page for this vulnerability makes mention of another, [CVE-2019-20626](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20626), the same vulnerability found in 2017 Honda HR-V vehicles, which Paraguayan security researcher Victor Casares demonstrated in a 2019 Medium post.

An unrelated but similar problem in 2012 Honda Civics allows for a [similar attack](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-46145), but with a different cause: a non-expiring rolling code and counter resync. This isn't just a Honda problem either. In 2016, *The Register* [reported](https://www.theregister.com/2016/08/11/car_lock_hack/) on an experiment in which researchers cloned a Volkswagen key fob and were able to use it to potentially unlock 100 million vehicles.

The researchers involved in this latest discovery said that vehicle owners don't have a lot of protection options as long as manufacturers continue using static codes. Rolling codes that change at each press of the button are "a security technology commonly used to provide a fresh code for each authentication of a remote keyless entry (RKE) or passive keyless entry (PKE) system," the researchers said.

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4btLnKFsntpXb-3spzsxQAAAMk&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4btLnKFsntpXb-3spzsxQAAAMk&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

Speaking of PKE systems, the researchers say that those are a significant improvement over RKE systems. Instead of relying on the fob to broadcast, the vehicle itself continually searches for a passive RF fob, like a door keycard, and once close enough the vehicle automatically unlocks. The close proximity required makes this attack far trickier.

Ultimately, the researchers say the only way to mitigate the problem if you're a victim is to head to the dealership and have them reset the key fob. As for prevention, the researchers go back to basics on this one: put your keys in a Faraday pouch.

We have asked Honda to comment. ®

# rtl\_433

rtl\_433 (despite the name) is a generic data receiver, mainly for the 433.92 MHz, 868 MHz (SRD), 315 MHz, 345 MHz, and 915 MHz ISM bands.

The official source code is in the <https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/> repository.
For more documentation and related projects see the <https://triq.org/> site.

It works with [RTL-SDR](https://github.com/osmocom/rtl-sdr/) and/or [SoapySDR](https://github.com/pothosware/SoapySDR/).
Actively tested and supported are Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongles (using RTL-SDR) and LimeSDR ([LimeSDR USB](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr) and [LimeSDR mini](https://www.crowdsupply.com/lime-micro/limesdr-mini) engineering samples kindly provided by [MyriadRf](https://myriadrf.org/)), PlutoSDR, HackRF One (using SoapySDR drivers), as well as SoapyRemote.

[![rtl_433 screenshot](/merbanan/rtl_433/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png)](/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/docs/screenshot.png)

## Building / Installation

rtl\_433 is written in portable C (C99 standard) and known to compile on Linux (also embedded), MacOS, and Windows systems.
Older compilers and toolchains are supported as a key-goal.
Low resource consumption and very few dependencies allow rtl\_433 to run on embedded hardware like (repurposed) routers.
Systems with 32-bit i686 and 64-bit x86-64 as well as (embedded) ARM, like the Raspberry Pi and PlutoSDR are well supported.

See [BUILDING.md](/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/docs/BUILDING.md)

On Debian (sid) or Ubuntu (19.10+), `apt-get install rtl-433` for other distros check <https://repology.org/project/rtl-433/versions>

On FreeBSD, `pkg install rtl-433`.

On MacOS, `brew install rtl_433`.

Docker images with rtl\_433 are available [on the github page of hertzg](https://github.com/hertzg/rtl_433_docker).

## How to add support for unsupported sensors

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](/merbanan/rtl_433/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Running

```
rtl_433 -h

```

```

  A "rtl_433.conf" file is searched in "./", XDG_CONFIG_HOME e.g. "$HOME/.config/rtl_433/",
  SYSCONFDIR e.g. "/usr/local/etc/rtl_433/", then command line args will be parsed in order.
		= General options =
  [-V] Output the version string and exit

       Specify a negative number to disable a device decoding protocol (can be used multiple times)
  [-X <spec> | help] Add a general purpose decoder (prepend -R 0 to disable all decoders)
  [-Y auto | classic | minmax] FSK pulse detector mode.
  [-Y level=<dB level>] Manual detection level used to determine pulses (-1.0 to -30.0) (0=auto).
  [-Y minlevel=<dB level>] Manual minimum detection level used to determine pulses (-1.0 to -99.0).
  [-Y minsnr=<dB level>] Minimum SNR to determine pulses (1.0 to 99.0).
  [-Y autolevel] Set minlevel automatically based on average estimated noise.
  [-Y squelch] Skip frames below estimated noise level to reduce cpu load.
  [-Y ampest | magest] Choose amplitude or magnitude level estimator.
		= Analyze/Debug options =
  [-A] Pulse Analyzer. Enable pulse analysis and decode attempt.
       Disable all decoders with -R 0 if you want analyzer output only.
  [-y <code>] Verify decoding of demodulated test data (e.g. "{25}fb2dd58") with enabled devices
		= File I/O options =
  [-S none | all | unknown | known] Signal auto save. Creates one file per signal.
       Note: Saves raw I/Q samples (uint8 pcm, 2 channel). Preferred mode for generating test files.
  [-r <filename> | help] Read data from input file instead of a receiver
  [-w <filename> | help] Save data stream to output file (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)
  [-W <filename> | help] Save data stream to output file, overwrite existing file
		= Data output options =
  [-F log | kv | json | csv | mqtt | influx | syslog | trigger | null | help] Produce decoded output in given format.
       Append output to file with :<filename> (e.g. -F csv:log.csv), defaults to stdout.
       Specify host/port for syslog with e.g. -F syslog:127.0.0.1:1514
  [-M time[:<options>] | protocol | level | noise[:<secs>] | stats | bits | help] Add various meta data to each output.

* Disabled by default, use -R n or a conf file to enable

		= Input device selection =
	RTL-SDR device driver is available.
  [-d <RTL-SDR USB device index>] (default: 0)
  [-d :<RTL-SDR USB device serial (can be set with rtl_eeprom -s)>]
	To set gain for RTL-SDR use -g <gain> to set an overall gain in dB.
	SoapySDR device driver is available.
  [-d ""] Open default SoapySDR device
  [-d driver=rtlsdr] Open e.g. specific SoapySDR device
	To set gain for SoapySDR use -g ELEM=val,ELEM=val,... e.g. -g LNA=20,TIA=8,PGA=2 (for LimeSDR).
  [-d rtl_tcp[:[//]host[:port]] (default: localhost:1234)
	Specify host/port to connect to with e.g. -d rtl_tcp:127.0.0.1:1234

		= Gain option =
  [-g <gain>] (default: auto)
	For RTL-SDR: gain in dB ("0" is auto).
	For SoapySDR: gain in dB for automatic distribution ("" is auto), or string of gain elements.
	E.g. "LNA=20,TIA=8,PGA=2" for LimeSDR.

		= Flex decoder spec =
Use -X <spec> to add a flexible general purpose decoder.

<spec> is "key=value[,key=value...]"
Common keys are:
	name=<name> (or: n=<name>)
	modulation=<modulation> (or: m=<modulation>)
	short=<short> (or: s=<short>)
	long=<long> (or: l=<long>)
	sync=<sync> (or: y=<sync>)
	reset=<reset> (or: r=<reset>)
	gap=<gap> (or: g=<gap>)
	tolerance=<tolerance> (or: t=<tolerance>)
	priority=<n> : run decoder only as fallback
where:
<name> can be any descriptive name tag you need in the output
<modulation> is one of:
	OOK_MC_ZEROBIT :  Manchester Code with fixed leading zero bit
	OOK_PCM :         Non Return to Zero coding (Pulse Code)
	OOK_RZ :          Return to Zero coding (Pulse Code)
	OOK_PPM :         Pulse Position Modulation
	OOK_PWM :         Pulse Width Modulation
	OOK_DMC :         Differential Manchester Code
	OOK_PIWM_RAW :    Raw Pulse Interval and Width Modulation
	OOK_PIWM_DC :     Differential Pulse Interval and Width Modulation
	OOK_MC_OSV1 :     Manchester Code for OSv1 devices
	FSK_PCM :         FSK Pulse Code Modulation
	FSK_PWM :         FSK Pulse Width Modulation
	FSK_MC_ZEROBIT :  Manchester Code with fixed leading zero bit
<short>, <long>, <sync> are nominal modulation timings in us,
<reset>, <gap>, <tolerance> are maximum modulation timings in us:
PCM/RZ  short: Nominal width of pulse [us]
         long: Nominal width of bit period [us]
PPM     short: Nominal width of '0' gap [us]
         long: Nominal width of '1' gap [us]
PWM     short: Nominal width of '1' pulse [us]
         long: Nominal width of '0' pulse [us]
         sync: Nominal width of sync pulse [us] (optional)
common    gap: Maximum gap size before new row of bits [us]
        reset: Maximum gap size before End Of Message [us]
    tolerance: Maximum pulse deviation [us] (optional).
Available options are:
	bits=<n> : only match if at least one row has <n> bits
	rows=<n> : only match if there are <n> rows
	repeats=<n> : only match if some row is repeated <n> times
		use opt>=n to match at least <n> and opt<=n to match at most <n>
	invert : invert all bits
	reflect : reflect each byte (MSB first to MSB last)
	decode_uart : UART 8n1 (10-to-8) decode
	decode_dm : Differential Manchester decode
	match=<bits> : only match if the <bits> are found
	preamble=<bits> : match and align at the <bits> preamble
		<bits> is a row spec of {<bit count>}<bits as hex number>
	unique : suppress duplicate row output

	countonly : suppress detailed row output

E.g. -X "n=doorbell,m=OOK_PWM,s=400,l=800,r=7000,g=1000,match={24}0xa9878c,repeats>=3"

		= Output format option =
  [-F log|kv|json|csv|mqtt|influx|syslog|trigger|null] Produce decoded output in given format.
	Without this option the default is LOG and KV output. Use "-F null" to remove the default.
	Append output to file with :<filename> (e.g. -F csv:log.csv), defaults to stdout.
	Specify MQTT server with e.g. -F mqtt://localhost:1883
	Add MQTT options with e.g. -F "mqtt://host:1883,opt=arg"
	MQTT options are: user=foo, pass=bar, retain[=0|1], <format>[=topic]
	Default user and password are read from MQTT_USERNAME and MQTT_PASSWORD env vars.
	A base topic can be set with base=<topic>, default is "rtl_433/HOSTNAME".
	Supported MQTT formats: (default is all)
	  events: posts JSON event data
	  states: posts JSON state data
	  devices: posts device and sensor info in nested topics
	Any topic string overrides the base topic and will expand keys like [/model]
	E.g. -F "mqtt://localhost:1883,user=USERNAME,pass=PASSWORD,retain=0,devices=rtl_433[/id]"
	With MQTT each rtl_433 instance needs a distinct driver selection. The MQTT Client-ID is computed from the driver string.
	If you use multiple RTL-SDR, perhaps set a serial and select by that (helps not to get the wrong antenna).
	Specify InfluxDB 2.0 server with e.g. -F "influx://localhost:9999/api/v2/write?org=<org>&bucket=<bucket>,token=<authtoken>"
	Specify InfluxDB 1.x server with e.g. -F "influx://localhost:8086/write?db=<db>&p=<password>&u=<user>"
	  Additional parameter -M time:unix:usec:utc for correct timestamps in InfluxDB recommended
	Specify host/port for syslog with e.g. -F syslog:127.0.0.1:1514

		= Meta information option =
  [-M time[:<options>]|protocol|level|noise[:<secs>]|stats|bits] Add various metadata to every output line.
	Use "time" to add current date and time meta data (preset for live inputs).
	Use "time:rel" to add sample position meta data (preset for read-file and stdin).
	Use "time:unix" to show the seconds since unix epoch as time meta data. This is always UTC.
	Use "time:iso" to show the time with ISO-8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD"T"hh:mm:ss).
	Use "time:off" to remove time meta data.
	Use "time:usec" to add microseconds to date time meta data.
	Use "time:tz" to output time with timezone offset.
	Use "time:utc" to output time in UTC.
		(this may also be accomplished by invocation with TZ environment variable set).
		"usec" and "utc" can be combined with other options, eg. "time:iso:utc" or "time:unix:usec".
	Use "replay[:N]" to replay file inputs at (N-times) realtime.
	Use "protocol" / "noprotocol" to output the decoder protocol number meta data.
	Use "level" to add Modulation, Frequency, RSSI, SNR, and Noise meta data.
	Use "noise[:<secs>]" to report estimated noise level at intervals (default: 10 seconds).
	Use "stats[:[<level>][:<interval>]]" to report statistics (default: 600 seconds).
	  level 0: no report, 1: report successful devices, 2: report active devices, 3: report all
	Use "bits" to add bit representation to code outputs (for debug).

		= Read file option =
  [-r <filename>] Read data from input file instead of a receiver
	Parameters are detected from the full path, file name, and extension.

	A center frequency is detected as (fractional) number suffixed with 'M',
	'Hz', 'kHz', 'MHz', or 'GHz'.

	A sample rate is detected as (fractional) number suffixed with 'k',
	'sps', 'ksps', 'Msps', or 'Gsps'.

	File content and format are detected as parameters, possible options are:
	'cu8', 'cs16', 'cf32' ('IQ' implied), and 'am.s16'.

	Parameters must be separated by non-alphanumeric chars and are case-insensitive.
	Overrides can be prefixed, separated by colon (':')

	E.g. default detection by extension: path/filename.am.s16
	forced overrides: am:s16:path/filename.ext

	Reading from pipes also support format options.
	E.g reading complex 32-bit float: CU32:-

		= Write file option =
  [-w <filename>] Save data stream to output file (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)
  [-W <filename>] Save data stream to output file, overwrite existing file
	Parameters are detected from the full path, file name, and extension.

	File content and format are detected as parameters, possible options are:
	'cu8', 'cs8', 'cs16', 'cf32' ('IQ' implied),
	'am.s16', 'am.f32', 'fm.s16', 'fm.f32',
	'i.f32', 'q.f32', 'logic.u8', 'ook', and 'vcd'.

	Parameters must be separated by non-alphanumeric chars and are case-insensitive.
	Overrides can be prefixed, separated by colon (':')

	E.g. default detection by extension: path/filename.am.s16
	forced overrides: am:s16:path/filename.ext

```

Some examples:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `rtl_433` | Default receive mode, use the first device found, listen at 433.92 MHz at 250k sample rate. |
| `rtl_433 -C si` | Default receive mode, also convert units to metric system. |
| `rtl_433 -f 868M -s 1024k` | Listen at 868 MHz and 1024k sample rate. |
| `rtl_433 -M hires -M level` | Report microsecond accurate timestamps and add reception levels (depending on gain). |
| `rtl_433 -R 1 -R 8 -R 43` | Enable only specific decoders for desired devices. |
| `rtl_433 -A` | Enable pulse analyzer. Summarizes the timings of pulses, gaps, and periods. Can be used with `-R 0` to disable decoders. |
| `rtl_433 -S all -T 120` | Save all detected signals (`g###_###M_###k.cu8`). Run for 2 minutes. |
| `rtl_433 -K FILE -r file_name` | Read a saved data file instead of receiving live data. Tag output with filenames. |
| `rtl_433 -F json -M utc | mosquitto_pub -t home/rtl_433 -l` | Will pipe the output to network as JSON formatted MQTT messages. A test MQTT client can be found in `examples/mqtt_rtl_433_test_client.py`. |
| `rtl_433 -f 433.53M -f 434.02M -H 15` | Will poll two frequencies with 15 seconds hop interval. |

## Security

Please note: We aim to make `rtl_433` safe to use, but it should not be assumed secure.
There is no reason to e.g. run with `sudo`, we do read and write files without any checks.

The output is literally pulled from thin air, it's not to be trusted.
If you feed downstream systems with data make sure edge cases are checked and handled.
Network inputs and outputs are for use in a trusted local network, will contain unfiltered data, and might overload the recipient
(know that e.g. the MQTT output can be controlled by anyone with a radio sender).

## Troubleshooting

If you see this error:

```
Kernel driver is active, or device is claimed by second instance of librtlsdr.
In the first case, please either detach or blacklist the kernel module
(dvb_usb_rtl28xxu), or enable automatic detaching at compile time.

```

then

```
sudo rmmod rtl2832_sdr dvb_usb_rtl28xxu rtl2832

```

or add

```
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu

```

to /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

## Man-in-the-Middle Trucking Attack

[Clever](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/08/truckers/):

> For over three years the pair hacked into a Department of Transportation website called Safersys.org, which maintains a list of licensed interstate-trucking companies and brokers, according to an [affidavit](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/files/lakes_complaint.pdf) (.pdf) filed by a DOT investigator. There, they would temporarily change the contact information for a legitimate trucking company to an address and phone number under their control.
>
> The men then took to the web-based “load boards” where brokers advertise cargo in need of transportation. They’d negotiate a deal, for example, to transport cargo from American Canyon, California, to Jessup, Maryland, for $3,500.
>
> But instead of transporting the load, Lakes and Berkovich would outsource the job to another trucking company, the feds say, posing as the legitimate company whose identity they’d hijacked. Once the cargo was delivered, the men invoiced their customer and pocketed the funds. But when the company that actually drove the truck tried to get paid, they’d eventually discover that the firm who’d supposedly hired them didn’t know anything about it.

Actually, not so clever. I’m amazed it went on for three years. You’d think that more than a few of the subcontracters would pick up the phone and call the original customers—and they’d figure out what happened. Maybe there are just so many trucking companies, and so many people who need cargo shipped places, that they were able to hide for three years.

But this scheme was bound to unravel sooner or later. If the criminal middlemen had legitimately subcontracted the work and just pocketed the difference, they might have remained undiscovered forever. But that’s much less profit per contract.

This reminds me: a decade or so ago I remember seeing a demonstration in front of Congress (outside) where some reformed car thieves dismantled (ie stripped) a 5-year old Cadillac in about 5 minutes while the onlookers watched. The total value of the parts recovered (they took everything but the chassis/unibody) was supposedly ~$50,000. They had paid about $15,000 for the car.

So my question was: why don’t they just buy the cars instead of stealing them? It would give them a smaller profit margin, true; until you add in the costs of hiding, sneaking, stealing, arrest, court/jail time, fights with other car thieves, etc. Plus you could still get additional value from the big pieces that werent strippable (crush/recycle the chassis).

It’s a well known fact that the majority of criminal activity is uneconomic by any measure. Freakonomics had a good section on this IIRC. You could build an economically useful arbitrage business out of the above scenario, but no, they had to shoot the goose that laid the golden egg. Dumb.

It’s always struck me that the fundamental flaw in most criminals is that, given the choice, they take the bigger short term (non-sustainable) profit rather than smaller long term (sustainable) profit; they also never know when to stop.

@ Bruce,

“Actually, not so clever. I’m amazed it went on for three years. You’d think that more than a few of the subcontracters would pick up the phone and call the original customers — and they’d figure out what happened. Maybe there are just so many trucking companies, and so many people who need cargo shipped places, that they were able to hide for three years.”

Have you considered that being “riped off” is an industry norm?

Or the state of the economy is making this to be just noise in the general “non payment”.

I have worked in some business areas where “10% of turnover” fraud levels where considered part and parcel of doing business and the cost of reclaiming to high so it just got added into customer fees.

“…It’s a well known fact that the majority of criminal activity is uneconomic by any measure….”

True. The ultimate motive is not rational, but emotional. This applies to nearly all legal business activity as well.

Criminals generally commit crimes out of laziness – it is easier to make an immediate profit by disregarding risk than to assess that risk and act for longer-term profits. Acting as an unlawful middle-man and only keeping residual profits “looks like work”, which is a primary reason why criminals don’t do it.

Seems like they’d last a lot longer if they paid the sub-contractor and pocketed the earnings. Much less lucrative, but over a longer time might net a lot more money.

$50k is probably the retail price of the parts, NEW from the dealer. The cost of the parts, used, would be significantly less. It’s possible that, yes, all the parts sold separately would be worth more than the cost of the car… IF you can sell all the parts. Problem is there is a high demand for certain parts; side windows, side mirrors, door and quarter panels. But how many people need to replace interior seats? Doesn’t make it worth while to buy a car for $15k if you’re only getting $10k from selling the high value parts and having to junk the rest.

The car thing is also a good example of the economists’ $20 Bill Theorem (there are no $20 bills on the sidewalk, because if there were someone would have picked them up already). If car theft miraculously stopped, and all the replacement parts had to come from dealer stock, junkers or cars purchased used, the price of the used cars would rise until the profit from chopping them up was in line with the profits from other legitimate sources of parts.

@William

“Acting as an unlawful middle-man and only keeping residual profits “looks like work”, which is a primary reason why criminals don’t do it.”

You missed the biggest reason criminals refuse to do it.

If they DID do it legitimately, then they would be regular workers at a regular job and NOT criminals … and therefore there would not be a story about them doing it.

@Uk Visa

“It’s always struck me that the fundamental flaw in most criminals is that, given the choice, they take the bigger short term (non-sustainable) profit rather than smaller long term (sustainable) profit; they also never know when to stop.

This case supports both observations.”

You just never hear about the ones who choose the smaller, long term, sustainable profit.

My guess is that many of the subcontractors were ‘unlicensed’ drivers. There is a large market of drivers who for whatever reason aren’t currently licensed or insured but have worked out an economy of doing jobs on the side etc. They may own their own rig, or borrow one from somewhere to get a job done (that rig itself may only be licensed or insured for local travel and not interstate work).

By using these third parties to do the work, you are pretty sure that few of them are going to mention it because well they could be doing hard time themselves if they ask too many questions. Of course you have to then worry about angry drivers with crowbars finding you.

The other case that comes up is that the sub-contracted company may call and be told that that is a contract dispute between you and company they were fooled by. In most cases the goods have been delivered so the first company has no interest in calling the Feds etc about it.

I guess the scam works because they were quoting prices below the cost of doing the job: arbitrage wouldn’t work in that case, they’d lose money on every deal. But, as they never pay for the work…

Actually, considering the scam started 3 years back, considering the rare cases in which the subcontractor might call the original customer, how significant will the cargo transport company be in the conversation given that the cargo is satisfactorily delivered to serve its purpose? Even when the first such glitches in protocol might ‘ve surfaced, the feds must’ve needed the time for sufficient incidents to occur, to frame a credible court case 🙂

Besides laziness and short time horizons, another significant reason for crime is that criminals are inveterate optimists, that bad stuff is never going to happen to them, once it does it ain’t going to happen again. <http://williambswift.blogspot.com/2009/03/optimism-is-not-necessarily-as.html>

Not that I’m condoning this in the least, clever as though it may be, but I sure am glad this was about making a few bucks, as opposed to say, running off with large shipments of dangerous materials…

Hopefully shipments of anything that might pose a threat are dealt with a little more carefully.

Are they even criminals anymore in this case? other than “hijacking” the name/reputation of an existing company, what’s illegal about subcontracting the work and keeping the difference. Sounds like a legitimate business model to me…

Well, if they started their own website and got famous so everyone went to their site to look for works, then it’s perfectly legal. Although people may starting to know how to avoid their “tax” by contacting the companies directly.

“You’d think that more than a few of the subcontracters would pick up the phone and call the original customers — and they’d figure out what happened.”

Remember: Many truck drivers are independant owners/operators. Not all truck drivers are associated with a trucking company.

---

I would say it falls under the theft through deception category. People think they are directly paying the trucking company $10,000 when they are just paying someone else $2,000 to pay the company $8,000. Without the deception, they would just go straight to the trucking company for the $8,000. More than the reputation/name is hijacked.

Not necessarily. We usually find the patient ones in city halls, capitol buildings, and Wall Street.

That remains, however, true.

There was an interesting phrase I heard last week, that does seem to ring true:

“Chicago’s politicians are corrupt, but competent at governance.”

It’s an interesting thing to think about, and pretty true. There’s no doubt places like Chicago, Providence, Boston have high levels of corruption. But they’re also pretty well run cities.

Compare that to Detroit or New Orleans where corruption is combined with complete lack of competency.

Does that mean being competent in what you do is more important then being ethical?

Sorry to intervene, but there might be something to say in favour of the choice of those becoming criminal. That’s the initial funding needed. There is a large number of humans in almost everey country that cannot afford (or borrow) the initial 15k$ necessary to buy the car in the first place.

I think at least some of those ripping parts off of cars are quite happy if they somehow aquired the tools to do so. (Which is another investment to be made beforehand.)

The posted reasons for becoming a criminal might be true as well, but at least one should allow for the slight opportunity that there are more “positive” reasons for why people stride from the path of legal business.

As usual, many of the earlier posters are right on.

@ Clive Robinson “..being ripped off is the industry norm.”

@Hjohn, @Vipool.. @Stephen.. also very good insights.

In one of my many careers, I worked in trucking operations, both Import / full load & LTL loads.. for several now-defunct companies.

We always looked for ways – and were taught or encouraged at all levels of management- to save money by skirting the laws. Whether we could move loads through subs/arbitrage.. (rather than union drivers or drivers who were over legal hours).. teach drivers ‘creative bookkeeping’ so they could squeeze one more run into their ‘legal hours of service’ or so they could balance the mileage/fuel tax sheets better.. or how to buy a midnight load of home heating oil (untaxed) to fill our diesel rigs.. or knowingly disguise/hide damaged freight just to get the customer’s signature and avoid a damage claim..

It was all crooked, and all done fairly openly. Even when cheating, we still ran at best a 2-3% margin, usually a 3-4% loss.

This crime takes advantage of the good reputations of some carriers (id theft), and the greed of many others. Unfortunately, the guy working the hardest -the driver delivering the freight- is the one who can least afford getting ripped off.

I hope the people who learn about this will all confirm future contracts out-of-band or some other way.

@ Exit14

Nice critique of deregulated markets.

I actually found the story most interesting because it resulted in a mental-illness debate. The accused drifted into an opportunity, and then acquired the means. Their motive was simply income and the article ends with a plea from the convicted to drive trucks and paint houses…if only that opportunity had presented itself earlier as a more feasible one than crime.

Davi Ottenheimer, I have a hard time sqauring the idea of “skirting the laws” with the idea of a “deregulated market”.

I could describe it as “poorly-regulated”, “unenforced regulation”, or possibly even “unenforcable regulation”, but not “deregulated”.

Maybe this would work at a Sonic.

You pull into the Sonic, and someone comes up saying the speaker is broken and takes your order. They go in, bring your food back and tell you it is $15. Later you find out, they weren’t an employee and the meal was really $12. Most people would think it was theft… you thought you were dealing directly with the source, and they presented themselves that way. It certainly could not be called a legitimate business model. If someone offered to pay them $3 to get them $12 worth of food, perhaps, but not in the deceit. (I know, I know, check receipts… not the point, just an illustration.)

Similar to the man in the middle. They injected themselves into the process through deceit resulting in scamming money out of someone who was mislead as to who they were.

I saw a Nightline a few years back about a (bank robber?) who just couldn’t understand why he was so “unlucky”. It took going to prison and learning chess to teach him that most of his life was determined by his actions. Now he works with kids, using chess to try to pass on the same lessons.

What these guys did was essentially, front-run the market.

For them it required a significant amouint of work and risk, however, they were doing almost exactly what goldman sachs has just been shown to be doing to the US stock exchange.

Goldman, however, have a privileged position, legitimated access to the servers and let the computers do the work.

I’m sure, somewhere in there, is the distinction between legal and illegal. The effect on the global economy however, is orders of magnitude different.

@HJohn: That’s straightforward fraud. These guys were offering services on an open exchange for contracts, which allows price discovery. A more accurate analogy would be driving up to your Sonic (I take it that’s a burger chain?) and there’s a line of a dozen guys: they all offer you a price and you pick the best one.

### About Bruce Schneier

![](https://149400697.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Bruce-Schneier.jpg)

I am a [public-interest technologist](https://public-interest-tech.com/), working at the intersection of security, technology, and people. I've been writing about security issues on my [blog](/) since 2004, and in my monthly [newsletter](/crypto-gram/) since 1998. I'm a fellow and lecturer at Harvard's [Kennedy School](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/faculty/bruce-schneier), a board member of [EFF](https://www.eff.org/), and the Chief of Security Architecture at [Inrupt, Inc.](https://inrupt.com/) This personal website expresses the opinions of none of those organizations.

Under their "prevention" section they say manufacturers should use rolling codes. This implies these FOBs don't use them, but per my previous understanding, they do. Perhaps there is more to the setup of this CVE than they're talking about. Is it possible they're doing a rolljam attack + replay? The CVE is really scant on details, so while I believe they did manage to get this to work, they don't really say how. If rolling codes are implemented, it should be pretty simple with the right gear to prove it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [belter](user?id=belter) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30808082)   | [parent](#30806776) | [next](#30807358) [–]  "...To better understand the impact of this vulnerability and Honda's plans to address the flaw, BleepingComputer reached out to Honda. Honda told us, multiple automakers use legacy technology for implementing remote lock-unlock functionality, and as such may be vulnerable to "determined and very technologically sophisticated thieves." "At this time, it appears that the devices only appear to work within close proximity or while physically attached to the target vehicle, requiring local reception of radio signals from the vehicle owner's key fob when the vehicle is opened and started nearby," a Honda spokesperson told BleepingComputer. Note, in their statement to us, Honda explicitly mentions it has not verified the information reported by the researchers and cannot confirm if Honda's vehicles are actually vulnerable to this type of attack. But should the vehicles be vulnerable, "Honda has no plan to update older vehicles at this time," the company tells BleepingComputer..."

That's pretty surprisingly recent! I understand that, in general, door locks aren't considered to be very high-security in vehicles: doors can be opened in other ways.

If you want to see what's possible with modern cars, keywords like "VVDI" or "Abrites" and "All Keys Lost" will show you what aftermarket tools are capable of. Generally speaking, the capabilities in these tools are roughly equivalent to those the most sophisticated criminals have, as they're usually just stealing the techniques from one another in a big circle. The level of security varies heavily from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, most modern VW cars require using an ECU exploit (which depending on the specific ECU, almost always requires physically removing the control unit and sometimes requires opening it) to extract encryption key data (CS/MAC) or physical extraction of the instrument cluster EEPROM. However other manufacturers like Toyota seem to be more vulnerable to other exploits (I only research VW for the most part, so I frankly have no idea what's going on here), including a bizarre process which seems to require disassembling the steering column and unplugging a connector. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [PaulHoule](user?id=PaulHoule) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30806506)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30806189) | [next](#30806894) [–]  I look at the enrollment problem on Zigbee networks and similar things and it's hard for me to resist the conclusion that the most practical architecture is to have a private key in the hub and a private key in the device and have these authenticate against a central server and have the central server give them both a shared key -- as much as people hate the central control, lack of interoperability, etc. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Teever](user?id=Teever) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30807799)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30806506) | [next](#30806894) [–]  I think people hate mandated central control.

He was later told by locals that if he had been seen by law enforcement his penalty would have been much more severe than the thief's.

I'm not sure what the effect of that observation is, though - key and immobilizer security is extremely important still, because cars which are stolen by any mechanism (tow, stolen key, transponder relay, etc) then need to be resold or broken down for parts. Especially in Europe where control module security is generally both more robust and more insurance regulated, many parts on a stolen vehicle are increasingly not valuable unless the immobilizer / key enrollment system can be bypassed. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [taneq](user?id=taneq) [on March 26, 2022](item?id=30808831)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30806894) | [prev](#30806972) | [next](#30806932) [–]  This has the added advantage that once the front of the car is lifted past a certain point the car assumes it's being legitimately towed and disables its alarm... | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [petre](user?id=petre) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30806932)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30806894) | [prev](#30808831) | [next](#30805650) [–]  Unless the victim has a GPS tracker installed on the vehicle. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [wildzzz](user?id=wildzzz) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30807932)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30806932) | [next](#30805650) [–]  But that would track any kind of theft.

You don't need existing keys for either system. The trick (used to be) at the time that BMW keys were difficult to cut, and the key cutters were well controlled. This isn't the case any more, and in reality if a key was the deterrent you could always just program an immobilizer chip from another key, tape the key/chip to the column, and then use a pry bar and screwdriver to break the key tumbler and turn the switch without a key. This is neither rare nor hard to do -- and it used to be the defacto way to steal pre-immobilizer Hondas (breaking the column/tumbler, that is). It was common enough that an in-joke at the Honda dealership I worked at was that a flathead screwdriver could be referred to as a 'lazy CRX key', a majority of those era cars encountered were so worn that a flat head would turn most of their tumblers by the time I got to work on them.

He comes out and goes "Oh I haven't done one of these in a while..." pulls a blank key out of his toolbox, sticks it in the door tumbler, and opens it right up. So now I have an 80 and an 81 Accord... and I have also interchanged keys between them. The 80 doesn't open as easily, as I think it's less worn out.

It might not be worth it to fix the car. Alternative option is to sell the car to someone in a state that does not require emissions testing. Also, if someone steals your catalytic converter, and there is not much damage, it is possible to “straight pipe” it for cheap and just not put in a catalytic converter.

They're almost certainly using a CAN bus (modern cars have both, OBD-2 strictly for legacy emissions testing and multiple CAN buses for everything else). Not that a CAN bus is any less accessible or more secure, but in almost all cases to do anything non-trivial over CAN like key programming requires the $20k dealer computer system (which is specific to every manufacturer and sometimes even model of car) or some serious reverse engineering chops and weeks of time to figure it out. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bri3d](user?id=bri3d) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805893)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30805866) | [next](#30806438) [–]  The OBD port exposes diagnostic interface on most cars, either K-Line or CAN. And indeed, many cars in the early 2000s supported key enrollment without cryptographic material using diagnostic tools, so it was only a matter of sniffing a dealership tool. More modern cars from most manufacturers require cryptographic material from a central server to enroll keys. These systems are still often broken (look up XHorse for a popular product in this space) but generally require more in-depth physical access or complex software exploits to bypass the signing process or extract private key material from hardware. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [qbasic\_forever](user?id=qbasic_forever) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805953)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30805893) | [next](#30806438) [–]  My '05 Holden has multiple buses and I imagine every car of that era and beyond is the same. One is OBD-2 and accessible under the steering wheel. It \_only\_ has the mandated emissions equipment info connected to it, like oxygen sensor readings and such. It has an entirely separate and different physical connector for a CAN bus, one in the engine bay and another under the driver seat IIRC. This one has all the goodies--locks, entertainment system, full engine diagnostics and sensors, etc. I actually have the full factory service manual for the car and key programming is only possible with GM's tech 2 computer system connected to the CAN bus, not OBD-2. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bri3d](user?id=bri3d) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30806068)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30805953) | [next](#30806438) [–]  This split-connectors model is actually quite uncommon. Many newer cars have either a single CAN bus, a "Gateway" module which bridges Diagnostic CAN accessible through the OBD port to the various CAN buses used inside of the car, or Ethernet / DoIP exposed over "unused" pins on the OBD connector. For example, on modern VW AG cars, key programming is performed over the OBD connector, using specific UDS readLocalIdentifier and writeLocalIdentifier requests, but the data involved in the Immobilizer is both signed and encrypted using secret keys on a VW server (called FAZIT) over a subscription system called GeKo. The dealer diagnostic tool essentially sets up a tunnel over UDS between the Immobilizer software module in a control unit and the FAZIT server. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [myself248](user?id=myself248) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30806438)   | [root](#30805377) | [parent](#30805866) | [prev](#30805893) | [next](#30806019) [–]  I'm in the industry and most cars 2008-2017 or thereabouts have multiple CAN buses exposed on the OBD2 port. One (powertrain CAN) on the regulated 6/14 pins which is guaranteed to answer the emissions messages but probably exposes other stuff too, and then others (body CAN, infotainment CAN, etc) on other pairs of pins. Post-2018-ish, they tend to have a gateway module, and accessing anything interesting requires you to get into the wiring "behind" the gateway where all the internal buses are. But that's also trivial, in most cars it takes about 20 seconds once your wrist knows the way. > requires the $20k dealer computer system Or knowing the messages it sends.

I wonder how hard could it be to measure response latency instead? That should solve the problem. I thought about selling those for a while (and got a few requests), but realized I can't easily design them for the many kinds of key fobs out there. I suppose the manufacturers are not adding them themselves because that would hurt the image of "security" of these key fobs. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hulitu](user?id=hulitu) [on March 26, 2022](item?id=30810099)   | [prev](#30805630) | [next](#30805649) [–]  > A hacker can gain complete and unlimited access to locking, unlocking, controlling the windows, opening the trunk, and starting the engine of the target vehicle I think those guys shall make some research before.

When I did this at my office car park, well-meaning people would call security and ask them to help the person with open windows by earning them they were open. Or if they knew it was my car they’d seek me out to warn me that my windows were down. The reason they gave was always that they were worried someone would steal stuff from the car. There was nothing in it to steal. Eventually I got sick of wasting other people’s time for them and left my windows closed. So many of them complained that their cars were hot, and/or had them broken into by people looking to steal things. I think the only real solution would be for me to buy a car that lets me take the roof off.

Sort of violates the idea of a "smash and grab" though. You want to minimize the noise generated and time spent and maximize the potential profit gained. Typically, you just inspect what is in plain view of the vehicle and if there's anything that has value (ie, backpack, clothes, cell phones) then it's a good target. If there's nothing in plain view, then there's no point in attracting attention and increasing the chances of getting caught. Of course, there are some municipalities that have decriminalized or refuse to prosecute this type of theft so that negative reinforcement no longer applies and you just get people that smash all windows and search entire vehicles. Anecdotally, just following the idea of "nothing in value being in plain view" has worked wonderfully for me. Works locally in my somewhat big city and when traveling to other big cities. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ctoth](user?id=ctoth) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805724)   | [prev](#30805649) | [next](#30805640) [–]  Unrelated but does anyone know of a good and available replacement for the HackRF One?

Given general trends, it's probably more common in Europe than in the US. More to your question though, the issue is that proximity key systems rely on the limited radio transmission range. If a thief uses something like an SDR to "amplify" or repeat the transmissions, they can get the car to think the key is much closer than it is... and potentially unlock the car in your driveway by "using" your key fob inside your house. A faraday pouch makes this very difficult by significantly attenuating the signal from the key fob. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rmetzler](user?id=rmetzler) [on March 26, 2022](item?id=30810378)   | [root](#30805941) | [parent](#30807059) | [prev](#30807265) | [next](#30807336) [–]  A faraday cage or faraday pouch blocks electric radio. For example a cellphone will not be able to communicate with the base station if you wrap it aluminium foil and the new car fobs work similar. The fob just needs to be in close distance to the car for someone to open the door or starting the car. A relay attack puts two radio devices between the car fob and the car, so thieves can open and start a car just by relaying the radio signal to the car fob behind the closed door. A replay attack will record the radio signals transmitted between fob and car and just replay them. And both attacks are absolutely possible. You can find videos on youtube for both. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [asdff](user?id=asdff) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30807336)   | [prev](#30805941) | [next](#30812851) [–]  It seems like there is a lot of security in just physical stuff. A car that needs you to use a key to unlock the door vs a signal that can be intercepted. A scrap of unimportant looking paper containing passwords vs a compromised password manager. It makes the attack surface so much smaller since, unless you are some VIP, chances are no one is going to ever root around your home for internet account passwords on scraps of paper. Software used by thousands of people presents an attractive target given the work vs reward ratio is so much more favorable, and imo its not a matter of if, but when, these systems do end up compromised. Maybe security in the future starts looking less like obfuscated software solutions, and more like simple analog solutions that ultimately require an operator on location, and are therefore too expensive to carry out to the scale that electronic crime has taken place in the past few decades. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hoppla](user?id=hoppla) [on March 26, 2022](item?id=30812851)   | [prev](#30807336) | [next](#30807094) [–]  I had an issue where I could not unlock the car or disable the electronic theft prevention. I guess I pressed the alarm button too many times while I was away from the car, and it went out of sync with the car. This was a tx only key fob. This would mean that the car needed to keep track of the rolling code, but to not lock the user out if he accidentally press the button while away from the car, it will need to accept current rolling code state plus some more (a window of accepted codes). Once the car gets a code within the window, it knows the state counter on the key fob and can synchronize. Not sure what to do, I kept pressing the key until I saw the car alarm turn off - it must have been hundreds of presses.

Much like how infotainment software can vary from one model year to the next while the hardware remains mostly unchanged--they're usually not giving you the option to just stop by the dealer for an update, much less let you do it yourself via USB or OTA. To be fair though, my example isn't absolute--as far as infotainment goes, Chevrolet has done free Android Auto/Carplay retrofits in the past if your older model hardware supported it, and Ford SYNC is upgradable by the consumer via USB. I don't know of any Toyota models that offer that same though. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pards](user?id=pards) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805570)   | [parent](#30805484) | [prev](#30809851) | [next](#30805942) [–]  Or reducing/eliminating the $800 keyfob replacement cost on my 2018 Rav4.

After we were done (and us kids had stressed her out), she opened up the car, parked in the mall car park, put us in the back of the car, checked we put on the seat belts, and then started to reverse out of the parking space, when all of a sudden she stopped, looked visibly confused for some moments, drove back in and took us out of the car again. Turns out it wasn't our car, just the same new VW Golf model in the same color, and her key worked for it for whatever reason. She only noticed because the actual owner had put some stuff on the rear window, which she only noticed when looking back to reverse out of the parking space. I have no clue if VW had the same keys for all/many cars back then, or if it was a huge coincidence that the key fit well enough.

It means vehicle X consistently relies on "the same" (unchanging) signal X, vehicle Y consistently relies on "the same" (unchanging) signal Y etc. As written, it sounds like every single honda of the same year & make uses *one, shared signal* which is not what is meant, unless I'm mistaken. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rovr138](user?id=rovr138) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30807176)   | [parent](#30807141) | [next](#30808106) [–]  I thought the same, but upon reading, I agree with your interpretation. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [arajesh](user?id=arajesh) [on March 26, 2022](item?id=30808106)   | [parent](#30807141) | [prev](#30807176) | [next](#30805708) [–]  Yes, you’re right! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rdtwo](user?id=rdtwo) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805708)   | [prev](#30807141) [–]  If a newer car gets stolen it’s just an inconvenience because it’s likely insured. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rurp](user?id=rurp) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30806076)   | [parent](#30805708) | [next](#30805720) [–]  Oh great, so all you have to worry about is: - the deductible cost - the risk of the insurance company not paying, or low-balling the payout - loss of all personal items in the vehicle - time and monetary cost of temporary transportation - future insurance premium increases - having to buy a new car We must have dealt with different insurance companies if your expectation is that it will be a quick, satisfactory, process. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ska](user?id=ska) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30806284)   | [root](#30805708) | [parent](#30806076) | [next](#30805720) [–]  Also, if you don't have replacement cost coverage you're either eating depreciation to buy new again, or hoping you can find a used one in the right cost/quality window. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [p1mrx](user?id=p1mrx) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805720)   | [parent](#30805708) | [prev](#30806076) | [next](#30805983) [–]  Even if that's true, new cars tend to become old cars. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kube-system](user?id=kube-system) [on March 25, 2022](item?id=30805983)   | [parent](#30805708) | [prev](#30805720) [–]  This doesn't enable anyone to steal the car, unless they also have a tow truck.

**Re: Why can another civic's key, crank up my Civic?? (Brian Hinson)**

Its nothing about the car. its about the pattern of the key. It happens in alot of cars suprisingly and also surprisingly alot of home locks!. my grandmother did this once on accident where she got into the car next to hers (same color, make, model) and she only noticed it wasnt hers b/c there was no junk in the seat.

back on topic, it all has to do with the lining up of the pins in the lock. Check his key next to yours and see how the pattern differs.

finally if you think its ur ignition, check if his key will open ur locked door. if so then you may want to have it checked.

I bought my car on christmas eve last year. 3 days later someone tried to steal it. It's sad you cant have anything nice. Did you ever replace your ignition? Mines is still hanging? I bought the plastic caeing that goes around the steering column. Havn't put it on yet.

You're in JC/Hobo right?

I'm not suprised.

My old 944 was stolen in Newark. NEVER recovered...never got paid by the insurance and lost the suit, I got screwed.

Anyway, You can't do \*\*\*\* about it...I wouldn't even worry about it.. I would rather someone steal my car with a key then bust everything possible.

pic any number from 1-10. write it down and do it again so you have 4 numbers. how many different combinations can you get before you start repeating combinations??

same thing with keys. even the keyless entry has been known to open different cars. not just another civic either.

This would be true but he also said his friends wouldnt open the lock.

however, i am curious about one thing. I would take you're friends key, and if you have your valet key check and see if they are similar

Just to chime in here, I ordered a new key for my car today from the dealer by my vin number. The new key has the same BASIC shape as my key ive been using but the new one has far more kaged edges to it, to the point it looks like it wouldent work. Surprisenly enough it does.

I won't park my hatch into the 201 unless I know it's safe, the prelude is the only thing I would park there cause I could care less about it.

My prelude was broken into once in Jamaica...Then I got a ticket for "obstruction of view" cause they cracked the windshield.

I have a civic and prelude, civic got stolen 3 weeks ago and prelude got broken into last night. They stole bull \*\*\*\* from the lude but I'm starting to hate having a honda. With these thieves its like trying to beat a magician at there own game. They know all the tricks and more.

RIP 92 EJ

## Summary:

This is a proof of concept for [CVE-2022-27254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27254), wherein the remote keyless system on various Honda vehicles send the same, unencrypted RF signal for each door-open, door-close, boot-open and remote start(if applicable). This allows for an attacker to eavesdrop on the request and conduct a replay attack.

## POC videos:

Remote.start.sequence.mp4

Door.unlock.sequence.mp4

Door.lock.sequence.mp4

## Vehicles Affected:

• 2016-2020 Honda Civic(LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, Type R)

## Important Notes:

```
 •Key fob FCC ID: KR5V2X

 •Key fob frequency: 433.215MHz

 •Key fob modulation: FSK

```

## Tools used:

```
       •FCCID.io
       •HackRF One
       •Gqrx
       •GNURadio

```

## Prevention:

* Manufacturers:

  1. Manufacturers must implement Rolling Codes, otherwise known as hopping code. It is a security technology commonly used to provide a fresh code for each authentication of a remote keyless entry (RKE) or passive keyless entry (PKE) system.
* Consumers:

  1. Utilize a Faraday Pouch for the key fob.
  2. Use the PKE as opposed to the RKE, this would make it significantly harder for an attacker to clone/read the signal due to the proximity they would need to be at to do so.

⚠️ The precautions mentioned above ARE NOT foolproof ⚠️

If you believe that you are a victim of this attack, the only current mitigation is to reset your key fob at the dealership.

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

You can receive signals from these sensors using a cheap SDR dongle and a program called rtl\_433. However, out of the box the process is bit messy and requires tweaking and interpretation. So I wrote a bash script that wraps rtl\_433, guides you through the process in an easy-to-understand way and summarizes the results. A program like this is not full automation, but it greatly reduces the cognitive overhead of doing this task. Now when I suspect a sensor is bad, I can just pull out the script without having to get back up to speed on how to orchestrate the component programs and interpret the results. It's like having a well-designed jig for a woodworking task, hanging on the wall for later use. Writing tiny programs like this is really satisfying because the scope is small enough that I can carefully consider all decisions. I spent a lot of time reading through guides and code samples, considering dependencies vs pure bash, understanding shellcheck warnings, and making the code conform to a style guide. All not strictly necessary to achieve the goal, but I learned a lot and take satisfaction in a small, but refined result. | | --- | --- | --- |  | |  |  | [el\_benhameen](user?id=el_benhameen) [on March 9, 2022](item?id=30620768)   | [next](#30620818) [–]  Do you have the code for this living anywhere?

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

How customer reviews and ratings work

Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.

To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzed reviews to verify trustworthiness.

##### This Little Alarm is Ear-Splitting LOUD !

Wow this is a great little alarm, very loud, so loud it will wake the dead who will be very angry that you disturbed their RIP, that's how loud it is. I purchased 2 of these and installed them on our eBikes, under the seat, see photo.When you press the activate button on the remote you hear a brief 1 sec melody that it's initiating, then after about 2 seconds you hear one beep letting you know it's activated and ready. If it's bumped or otherwise senses motion two loud beeps sound as a warning, and if it's bumped or moved again then the alarm wails extremely loud for about 30 seconds, then stops. Or if it continues to sense motion then the loud alarm sound wails continuously until it senses no motion at which time it stops.No anti-theft alarm is perfect, but this little guy will definitely be a big and immediate surprise to any would be thief, who no doubt will reconsider what he's doing, while also being concerned about people in the vicinity who no doubt have turned to look towards the alarm noise.The alarm requires 3 AAA batteries and the remote requires one 12V/27A small cylindrical battery. The instructions are really bad, but some reviewers explain more clearly how to operate this alarm. The good news is that the factory default is already set for the loudest level and the most sensitive motion detection, so if you're okay with that (I am), then it's all set to install. Regardless, it's a great little alarm that is ear-splitting LOUD! So I purchased a 3rd one for our RV travel trailer entry door (mounted on inside of door, still very loud from outside, will definitely make its presence known).Yeah I really like this Super Duper Ear-Splitting LOUD Alarm!MoreHide

  Reviewed in the United States on December 9, 2024[Verified Purchase](/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_rvw_avp?nodeId=G8UYX7LALQC8V9KA)
  Edited Review: This is a great product. Very loud and effective theft deterrent. The original instructions were hard to understand & all but impossible to figure out how to adjust any of the settings - but the company reached out after I posted my original review & sent me a little pdf with a much clearer "How To" guide & I'm pleased to say it works like a charm now! Since it comes shipped to you on the highest settings, the alarm is blaring & the sensitivity is way too high. Now that I was able to figure out how to adjust it, it works great. Someone actually complimented me on it at a store the other day. This is well worth the money you will spend on it, & it comes from a company who cares about their reviews and its customers. 2 thumbs up. :)

  I fitted this to my dream motorbike to help keep it safe from tampering and theft. Easy to install, unobtrusive and it works very well. The unit is configurable with easy to understand instructions included. You can adjust the sensitivity of the accelerometer and also the tone and volume of the alarm. I recommend you add this to your arsenal of anti theft devices for your motorbike.

  I've used this alarm for around 9 months now. It gives me great peace of mind when I have to take my eyes off my bike for a couple minutes. It still works good-as-new even now. Let's talk about the details:

  INSTALLATION
  The alarm comes with zipties to attach to your bike. I have a very well-concealed black part of my frame that works nicely for this. Underneath your seat is another good option. If you want extreme protection, you can use metal zipties. Keep in mind that you will need to eventually replace the battery, and you might need to cut through the metal zipties to do so. Have the necessary tools ready (probably a Dremel).

  SETTING THE ALARM
  Easy enough, just press the big round button on the remote. You can be pretty far away to do so. One complaint: the alarm makes a loud beep when you set it. This makes sense: you want to know the alarm's going to be loud. It's not so great for crowded places though: expect a lot of attention. I wish there was a quieter beep when you set the alarm and a separate "test" functionality that let you inspect the loudness of it.

  TRIGGERING THE ALARM
  The alarm is extremely sensitive. The smallest touch will set it off. It will allow some movement after initially setting the alarm though. Triggering the alarm causes with a moderately loud warning beep, followed by an ear-splittingly loud alarm if you keep moving the bike around.

  UNSETTING THE ALARM
  Works just like setting the alarm. Again: it makes a loud noise, and I really wish it made a quieter one so I didn't have to disturb other people around me.

  MAINTENANCE
  This is a pretty simple device. You don't need to do much to maintain it. At some point (9 months for me) the alarm will start making a warning beep for low battery. The alarm itself takes 3 AAA batteries. It can be kind of hard to open: the alarm comes with a special plastic triangle for prying it open. This is another thing I would improve: why not just have some Phillips-head screws?

  IMPORTANT: replace the remote's battery whenever you replace the alarm's battery. The remote will not alert you if it has low battery. It will last longer than the alarm batteries, though. So once the alarm alerts you of low battery, replenish it and the remote. The remote takes a single A27 battery. This is a standard battery size that's easy to find. It's very easy to replace the remote's battery with a small Phillips-head screwdriver.

  I have it on my Honda PVC and it works great. If you touch the bike it will worn you and if you persist the alarm will go off. The batteries last a long time and will alert you when they are getting low. I bought a second one for my bmw which is all electronic and works with a fob. I wanted something to warn people not to touch my vehicle. It’s a bargain and it really works

  I feel so much safer now. I use it as a personal alarm since I got mugged and robbed in LA. I use it by remote if I feel I’m being attacked. I tried it when it arrived and works good! Nice and loud and I love the multiple alarm settings. Thankfully I haven’t had to use it yet! I also use it because I am a concert violinist who carries a Stradivari everywhere I go and I do a lot of travelling so this alarm unit is good for me and my violin! Thank you for the quick ship and a very good product! Highly recommend

  ##### *5.0 out of 5 stars* Scare Away/ Slow Down Bike Thieve’s Device

  On opening up the alarm to try out the batteries and the device, I had a concern. The screw seemed really cheap, as did the screw driver. I was worried about stripping the screw itself or the plastic. But I used my own Phillips screw driver and gently got that screw out to proceed to the next step of opening up the alarm box. They give you a plastic device that looks like a guitar pick and that was useless in trying to open up the alarm box. I got two slot head screw drivers and used those to wedge away at the tightly sealed plastic. I ended up chipping the plastic a bit opening up the two halves.

  Next, was installing the three triple A batteries. They looked real cheap, so I threw those away and used high quality batteries I purchased separately. The batteries installed securely. Everything looked intact inside, so I put the alarm box together again to try it out.

  Next, was trying to read the very, very small print instructions with my big magnifying glass. I gave up on that and went to You Tube to find instructions there and I did. So I slowly went through setting up the remote control’s three buttons. That went well and discovered, an excellent bike horn. The seven different high pitched alarm to chose from in pitch and the three different types of noise was a perfect deterrent noise.

  I don’t get my new e-bike until May and can’t install/ try it out until then. But I’ll install the alarm with the tie wraps and the two-sided stickers provided. The location will be under my seat in the posterior direction to keep it drier.

  Once you activate your alarm, by the remote button. The first disturbance (dependent on sensitivity setting you chose. I suggest the 4th level) your alarm sounds a warning short beep. On the SECOND disturbance of your bike, then the continued alarming begins. The noise definitely will attract onlookers and annoy your bike thief. This remote is effective for 60 feet away. My Apple Air Tag will be located under the bike seat, just inches away from this alarm - under black Gorilla Tape. The remote control will be located by my right thumb on the handle bar, because of that cool sounding horn. I use my plastic rescue whistle as well and a flicker bell alarm to warn people ahead, I am coming behind them. Then I announce verbally, “passing to your left” and carefully pass other hikers on the bike pathways.

  The color black blends into my seat and bike rack color and the looks of the alarm appears esthetically good for my bike. Overall, I am confident the alarm/ horn will endure a long time and will do its job to SCARE AWAY THE THIEF or at least slow down the bike thief. Even though the bike horn will be located under my bike seat, I am again confident pedestrians and other bikers will hear this horn. So good price and apparently good, effective bike alarm!!

  La alarma la instalé en un lugar poco visible de la moto con las bridas que lleva conjuntamente. Cuando está activada al mínimo movimiento de la moto o golpe se activa emitiendo un pitido. Si continúas moviéndola empieza a sonar con los distintos sonidos que emite la alarma. La recomiendo para las motos que duermen tanto en garaje como en la calle cerca de la vivienda del dueño para saber si te están robando la moto. Lo único que no me ha gustado es que las instrucciones no vienen en español. A pesar de ello la alarma es muy intuitiva y fácil de manejar.

4. Network Sniffing

# Network Sniffing

Adversaries may passively sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.

Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay](/techniques/T1557/001), can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.

Network sniffing may reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent [Lateral Movement](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0008) and/or [Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0005) activities. Adversaries may likely also utilize network sniffing during [Adversary-in-the-Middle](/techniques/T1557) (AiTM) to passively gain additional knowledge about the environment.

In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to.[[1]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/traffic-mirroring-how-it-works.html)[[2]](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/packet-mirroring)[[3]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-tap-overview) Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic.[[4]](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/abusing-vpc-traffic-mirroring-in-aws/)[[5]](https://posts.specterops.io/through-the-looking-glass-part-1-f539ae308512) The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic.[[4]](https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/aws/abusing-vpc-traffic-mirroring-in-aws/)

On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures using [Network Device CLI](/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `monitor capture`.[[6]](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA18-106A)[[7]](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ios-nx-os-software/ios-embedded-packet-capture/116045-productconfig-epc-00.html)

If you're driving a Honda Civic manufactured between 2016 and 2020, this newly reported key fob hijack should start your worry engine.

Keyless entry exploits are nothing new. Anyone armed with the right equipment can sniff out a lock or unlock code and retransmit it. This particular issue with some Honda vehicles is just the latest demonstration that auto manufacturers haven't adapted their technology to keep up with known threats.

This security weakness, tagged [CVE-2022-27254](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-27254), was discovered by Ayyappan Rajesh, a student at University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, and someone with the handle HackingIntoYourHeart. Their [research](https://github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254) indicated that Honda Civic LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, and Type R vehicles manufactured between 2016 and 2020 all have this vulnerability.

According to the duo, who thanked professors Hong Liu and Ruolin Zhou and mentor Sam Curry, "various Honda vehicles send the same, unencrypted RF signal for each door-open, door-close, boot-open and remote start. This allows for an attacker to eavesdrop on the request and conduct a replay attack."

The GitHub page created for the vulnerability hosts three separate proof-of-concept videos showcasing their results. Essentially, it's shown that you can wait nearby for an owner to wirelessly open or start their vehicle, record that signal over the air, and later on you transmit that data again to perform the same action for yourself.

Attackers only needed a few easily sourced components to execute their attack: a laptop, the GNURadio development toolkit, Gqrx software-defined radio (SDR) receiver software, access to the FCCID.io website, and a HackRF One SDR. The only cost associated with the attack (besides owning a laptop) is purchasing the [HackRF One](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/one/), which retails in the mid-$300 range. All software used in the attack is free and open source.

### A common problem

The CVE page for this vulnerability makes mention of another, [CVE-2019-20626](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-20626), the same vulnerability found in 2017 Honda HR-V vehicles, which Paraguayan security researcher Victor Casares demonstrated in a 2019 Medium post.

An unrelated but similar problem in 2012 Honda Civics allows for a [similar attack](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-46145), but with a different cause: a non-expiring rolling code and counter resync. This isn't just a Honda problem either. In 2016, *The Register* [reported](https://www.theregister.com/2016/08/11/car_lock_hack/) on an experiment in which researchers cloned a Volkswagen key fob and were able to use it to potentially unlock 100 million vehicles.

The researchers involved in this latest discovery said that vehicle owners don't have a lot of protection options as long as manufacturers continue using static codes. Rolling codes that change at each press of the button are "a security technology commonly used to provide a fresh code for each authentication of a remote keyless entry (RKE) or passive keyless entry (PKE) system," the researchers said.

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4ew7CqfLBQIO550D_83OgAAAQg&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4ew7CqfLBQIO550D_83OgAAAQg&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

Speaking of PKE systems, the researchers say that those are a significant improvement over RKE systems. Instead of relying on the fob to broadcast, the vehicle itself continually searches for a passive RF fob, like a door keycard, and once close enough the vehicle automatically unlocks. The close proximity required makes this attack far trickier.

Ultimately, the researchers say the only way to mitigate the problem if you're a victim is to head to the dealership and have them reset the key fob. As for prevention, the researchers go back to basics on this one: put your keys in a Faraday pouch.

# Have You Heard About OBD III?

With the recent approval of regulations governing on-board diagnostics (OBD) information availability, the Automotive Service Association (ASA) has been pleased with the cooperation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the development of information transfer to repairers. ASA was a strong advocate of independent service shop owners and technicians having access to the same information accessible to new car dealers. The EPA protected these rights in its draft information availability rule and in the final rule published last summer.

One area of concern has been the recent discussion surrounding a waiver of federal preemption to permit California to implement its own OBD regulations. The serious question for independent repairers has been whether our rights will be protected as strongly as in the federal regulations. This is an issue ASA is discussing with regulators and other members of the aftermarket. ASA will make a decision in the near future as to a California strategy on the waiver.

As the OBD II (federal OBD uses the same basic technical standards as California OBD II) debate comes to a close, speculation is already mounting about an OBD III concept in California. OBD III is being discussed as a program to minimize the delay between the detection of an emissions malfunction by the OBD II system and the actual repair of the vehicle. This includes a reading of stored OBD II information from in-use vehicles and the direction to owners of vehicles with fault codes to make immediate repairs. In this concept, faults are picked up by a monitoring technology and reported to a regulator, and the vehicle owner is then directed to get further testing and possible repairs. The debate over controlling vehicle emissions may soon move from what type of testing facilities and test methods are most effective to the complete on-board cycle of fault detection, notification and follow-up testing and repair being discussed in the OBD-III concept.

What types of technology can be used to detect and relay data pertaining to emissions malfunctions? Options include roadside readers, local station networks or satellites. The roadside reader has been tested by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) since 1994. It is capable of reading eight lanes of bumper-to-bumper traffic at 100 miles per hour. It can be used from a fixed location with portable units or a mobile unit. If a fault is detected by a reader unit, it has the capability of sending the vehicle identification number (VIN) plus the fault codes to the regulator. (The term regulator is used broadly here--patrol officers, private contractors or others could be involved, depending on how a program is structured.) The local station network has not been tested by CARB, but would allow a location and monitoring service.

The satellite system can be used with a cellular phone hookup or location monitoring technology. The vehicle would receive an alert via a cellular phone or the monitoring technology. The location, date, time, VIN and OBD II data would be returned to a satellite beacon.

Several issues surround the OBD III concept. From a regulatory perspective, all of the technologies used, other than roadside technology, require a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license. The possibility of interference with other signals in the same band is of concern. The issues of commercial operators, law enforcement, jurisdiction among state agencies, Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems, etc., have to be addressed before OBD III is a reality.

How would an OBD-III program prompt further testing and possible repair? An OBD-III program could be incorporated into the current inspection and maintenance (I/M) program. OBD III might also be used to generate an "out-of-cycle" inspection. Once a fault is detected, a notice could be mailed to the vehicle owner requiring an out-of-cycle inspection within a certain number of days or at the next registration or resale, or a citation would be issued. Penalties might include court appearances or fines related to vehicle registration.

A roadside pullover might work this way: the monitoring technology detects a fault, a law enforcement officer stops the vehicle with the fault code, and a technician working with the officer at the scene verifies that a code is set. A citation is then issued requiring testing at a test center, with a time limit for the vehicle owner to do this before a penalty is incurred.
What legal issues arise under OBD III? There seems to be some question as to the "suspicionless mass surveillance" of private property. There is no opportunity to confront or rebut the results; no notice that the vehicle will be tested. Fourth Amendment search and seizure issues tend to arise.

There are obviously technologies and enforcement procedures available to support the OBD III concept. Do the public health arguments as to controlling the severity of air pollution override the constitutional privacy questions involved? What about consent? These are questions that will undoubtedly arise, and could bring a court challenge.

After several court battles with OBD II, the issues are still unsettled as to the California waiver. I/M programs are still to be finalized in several states and the threat of congressional action looms. The concept of bringing all the issues under one program will certainly be controversial, but is being discussed as far as a long-term policy. Independent repairers need to prepare for the next waive of emissions and information issues as they continue to participate in the current debate involving the same.

ASA is working with regulators and other members of the aftermarket to ensure that the independent repairers' interests are included as longterm policies are developed.

Researchers have disclosed a 'replay attack' vulnerability affecting select Honda and Acura car models, that allows a nearby hacker to unlock your car and even start its engine from a short distance.

The attack consists of a threat actor capturing the RF signals sent from your key fob to the car and resending these signals to take control of your car's remote keyless entry system.

The vulnerability, according to researchers, remains largely unfixed in older models. But Honda owners may be able to take some action to protect themselves against this attack.

## From wireless unlocking to keyless engine start

This week, multiple researchers disclosed a vulnerability that can be used by a nearby attacker to unlock some Honda and Acura car models, and start their engines wirelessly.

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2022-27254, is a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack or more specifically a replay attack in which an attacker intercepts the RF signals normally sent from a remote key fob to the car, manipulates these signals, and re-sends these at a later time to unlock the car at will.

A [video](https://github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254) shared by the researchers also demonstrates the remote engine start aspect of the flaw—although no technical details or proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code were shared at this time:

The researchers credited with discovering the vulnerability are computer scientist [Blake Berry](https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/), and researcher [Ayyappan Rajesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayyappan-rajesh/).

According to researchers, the vehicles impacted by this bug primarily include the 2016-2020 Honda Civic (LX, EX, EX-L, Touring, Si, Type R) cars.

In a GitHub repository, Berry shared that it was also possible to manipulate the captured commands and re-transmit them to achieve a different outcome altogether.

For example, in one of his [tests](http://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty), Berry recorded the "lock" command sent by the key fob, which consisted of the following bits.

653-656, 667-668, 677-680, 683-684, 823-826, 837-838, 847-850, 853-854

Berry then "flipped" and re-sent these bits to the vehicle, that in turn had the effect of unlocking the vehicle.

This isn't the first time that such a flaw has been reported in cars either.

In 2020, Berry had reported a similar flaw (CVE-2019-20626) affecting the following Honda and Acura models but alleged that Honda ignored his report and "continued to implement 0 security measures against this very simple 'replay/replay and edit' attack."

* 2009 Acura TSX
* 2016 Honda Accord V6 Touring Sedan
* 2017 Honda HR-V (CVE-2019-20626)
* 2018 Honda Civic Hatchback
* 2020 Honda Civic LX

The researchers' recommendation for the vehicle manufacturers is that they implement 'rolling codes,' also known as hopping codes. This security technology provides fresh codes for each authentication request, and as such these codes cannot be 'replayed' by an attacker at a later time.

In January 2022, researcher *Kevin2600* had also disclosed a similar vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2021-46145](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-46145), but [mentioned](http://tiger-team-1337.blogspot.com/2022/01/honda-civic-keyfob-system-affected-by.html) that the particular keyless system used rolling codes, therefore making the attack far less effective:

> So plus the one [CVE-2021-46145] I found a few months ago, we now have at least 3 CVEs related to Honda <https://t.co/HoVahGCbtA> Well done! [@Honda](https://twitter.com/Honda?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) :p

## Honda has 'no plan' to update older models

To better understand the impact of this vulnerability and Honda's plans to address the flaw, BleepingComputer reached out to Honda.

Honda told us, multiple automakers use legacy technology for implementing remote lock-unlock functionality, and as such may be vulnerable to "determined and very technologically sophisticated thieves."

"At this time, it appears that the devices only appear to work within close proximity or while physically attached to the target vehicle, requiring local reception of radio signals from the vehicle owner's key fob when the vehicle is opened and started nearby," a Honda spokesperson told BleepingComputer.

Note, in their statement to us, Honda explicitly mentions it has not verified the information reported by the researchers and cannot confirm if Honda's vehicles are actually vulnerable to this type of attack.

But should the vehicles be vulnerable, "Honda has no plan to update older vehicles at this time," the company tells BleepingComputer.

"It's important to note, while Honda regularly improves security features as new models are introduced, determined and technologically sophisticated thieves are also working to overcome those features."

Further, the company argues that a nearby thief can use other means to access a vehicle, as opposed to relying on hi-tech hacks like these and there is no indication that the type of interception device in question is widely used. Although, the remote engine start aspect of the flaw remains problematic as it goes well beyond a simple door unlock hack.

The researchers suggest that consumers store their key fobs in signal-blocking 'Faraday pouches' when not in use, although that approach still won't protect against a determined attacker eavesdropping on signals when the fob is used.

Another suggestion made by the researchers is for consumers to opt for [Passive Keyless Entry (PKE) as opposed to Remote Keyless Entry (RKE)](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Remote-keyless-entry-RKE), which would make it "significantly harder for an attacker to clone/read the signal due to the proximity they would need to be at to do so."

"If you believe that you are a victim of this attack, the only current mitigation is to reset your key fob at the dealership," conclude the researchers.

*Update March 26th, 01:48 AM ET: Credits for the vulnerability have been updated as requested by the researchers. An earlier version of the GitHub repository with the demo videos credited the researchers [differently](http://web.archive.org/web/20220325194331/https%3A//github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254/blob/main/README.md) but this was later [revised](http://github.com/nonamecoder/CVE-2022-27254/commit/2d01cbc228e158deedd1c8e782deefc90f1fd165).*

  Maybe just use some sort of physical key, that you turn in a lock? Modern cars should give up on wireless locks.
