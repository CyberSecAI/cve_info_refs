- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function in the `SecureBrowseFile` functionality of the OAS Platform, allowing unauthenticated access to file system information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306). The application does not require authentication to perform the `SecureBrowseFile` action.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Disclosure of sensitive information such as directory listings, exposing the file structure and potentially revealing configuration files or other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network request to the OAS Platform's configuration port (TCP/58727 by default).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target system on the specified port. No prior authentication is required.
