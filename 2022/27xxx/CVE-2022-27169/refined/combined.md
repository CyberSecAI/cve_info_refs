# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1494

## Open Automation Software Platform Engine SecureBrowseFile information disclosure vulnerability

##### May 25, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-27169

### Summary

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the OAS Engine SecureBrowseFile functionality of Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112. A specially-crafted network request can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. An attacker can send a network request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Open Automation Software OAS Platform V16.00.0112

### Product URLs

OAS Platform - <https://openautomationsoftware.com/knowledge-base/getting-started-with-oas/>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.5 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-306 - Missing Authentication for Critical Function

### Details

The OAS Platform was built to facilitate the simplified transfer of data between various proprietary devices and applications. It can be used to connect products from multiple different vendors, connect a product to a custom application, and more.

By sending a properly-formatted unauthenticated configuration message to the OAS Platform, it is possible to get a directory listing at any location permissible by the underlying user. By default this message can be sent to TCP/58727 and, if successful, will be processed by the user `oasuser` with normal user permissions. When a `SecureBrowseFile` command is successfully processed, the response will contain the output of a command similar to `ls`. This will provide a response similar to the following:

```
### Mitigation

The easiest way to mitigate attempts to exploit this vulnerability is to prevent access to the configuration port (TCP/58727 by default) when not actively configuring the OAS Platform. Additionally, use a dedicated user account to run the OAS Platform and ensure that user account does not have any more permissions than absolutely necessary.
