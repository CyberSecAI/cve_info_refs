Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27376:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The NetApp advisory NTAP-20220519-0007 explicitly mentions "CVE-2022-27376 MariaDB Vulnerability in NetApp Products". This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.
   - The description in the NetApp advisory also confirms it: "MariaDB Server versions through 10.6.5 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
    - The root cause is a vulnerability within the MariaDB Server versions through 10.6.5. The vulnerability is located within the `Field::set_default` function that leads to an ASAN use-after-free error in `Item_args::walk_arg` function.
   - The provided Jira issue [MDEV-26354](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-26354) further details the crash in `Field::set_default` and the ASAN (AddressSanitizer) error, indicating a use-after-free vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
    -  Use-after-free vulnerability: A memory corruption issue where memory is accessed after it has been freed, leading to a crash.
    -  The vulnerability lies within the MariaDB server code specifically related to handling default values within tables.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successful exploitation is a Denial of Service (DoS). This is confirmed by both the NetApp advisory ("Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS)") and the provided ASAN report from the Jira issue ("==1434754==ABORTING" ). The provided crash log also indicates the crash of the MariaDB server.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - The vulnerability can be triggered by specially crafted SQL queries.
   - The specific steps to trigger the vulnerability using SQL queries are outlined in the Jira issue. These steps involve creating a temporary table with a complex default value, inserting data, altering the table's character set and then performing insert/select operations that utilize indexes and complex expressions, which ultimately trigger the bug.
     - `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE v0 ( v2 LONG VARBINARY DEFAULT ( USER ( ) REGEXP 'x' IS NULL IS NULL IS UNKNOWN ) NOT NULL , REPAIR BINARY , LIST TIMESTAMP , v1 INT ) ;`
     - `INSERT IGNORE INTO v0 VALUES ( v1 , 'x' , ( CONVERT ( v2 * ( 47347653.000000 - v1 ) * FALSE * 83516185.000000 , DATETIME ) SOUNDS LIKE 'x' ) , 'x' ) ;`
     - `ALTER TABLE v0 CONVERT TO CHARSET BINARY ;`
     - `INSERT HIGH_PRIORITY INTO v0 SELECT * FROM v0 USE INDEX FOR JOIN ( ) GROUP BY v1 , CONVERT ( v1 IS FALSE , BINARY ( 6934439.000000 ) ) IS NULL HAVING DEFAULT ( v2 ) NOT REGEXP 'x' IS NULL IS FALSE ;`
     - `INSERT INTO v0 SELECT SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS * FROM v0 WHERE v2 SOUNDS LIKE CURRENT_USER IS TRUE ORDER BY UTC_DATE LIKE FALSE ESCAPE 'x' IS NULL IS TRUE DESC ;`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
    - **Network Access:** The advisory states the attack vector as `AV:N`, meaning that it is exploitable over a network.
    - **No Authentication Required:** The attack vector also states `PR:N` which means that no privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
    -  **No User Interaction:** The attack vector also states `UI:N` which means no user interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
