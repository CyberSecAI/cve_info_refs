{
  "CVE-2022-27387": {
    "Description": "A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the decimal_bin_size function in MariaDB Server versions through 10.7, triggered during a SELECT statement with GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses. This overflow can lead to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the `decimal_bin_size` function, which is triggered during the execution of a specific SQL query.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Global-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted SQL query that includes GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses, which triggers the vulnerable code path in `decimal_bin_size` function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute arbitrary SQL queries on a vulnerable MariaDB server. No special privileges are required.",
    "Affected versions": [
      "10.3 (EOL)",
      "10.4 (EOL)",
      "10.5",
      "10.6",
      "10.7 (EOL)"
    ],
    "More details": "The provided ASAN report pinpoints the overflow occurring at `/experiment/mariadb-server/strings/decimal.c:1551` in `decimal_bin_size`, due to a read of size 4 at an address outside the boundaries of the global variables `dig2bytes` and `frac_max`. The PoC provided shows the query which triggers the vulnerability."
