GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The OpenV2G project provides an open source implementation of the latest draft of the ISO/IEC Vehicle-
to-Grid Communication Interface (V2G CI) standard. Based on the OpenV2G library you are able to
exchange the standardised XML-based messages between a Plug-In Electrical Vehicle (PEV) and an
Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE).

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-27242

The OpenV2G EXI parsing feature is missing a length check when parsing X509 serial numbers. Thus,
an attacker could introduce a buffer overﬂow that leads to memory corruption.
