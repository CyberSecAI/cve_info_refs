- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OpenV2G EXI parsing feature lacks a length check when parsing X509 serial numbers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the missing length check during the parsing of X509 serial numbers, leading to memory corruption. Specifically, it is a "Classic Buffer Overflow" (CWE-120).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trigger memory corruption which leads to a denial of service (availability impact).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be performed locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges are required (PR:N), no user interaction is required (UI:N)
