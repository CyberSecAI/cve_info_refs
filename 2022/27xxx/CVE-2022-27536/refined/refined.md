Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-27536:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `crypto/x509` package of the Go programming language, specifically within the `Certificate.Verify` function.
*   The issue occurs when verifying certificate chains that contain certificates not compliant with RFC 5280.
*   On macOS, this non-compliance can lead to a panic within the `Certificate.Verify` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The `crypto/x509` package does not properly handle malformed certificates on macOS, leading to a crash instead of graceful error handling.
*   The specific issue is related to how macOS handles certificate verification and a failure of `CFRelease` on an invalid CFArray reference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote TLS server can send a malformed certificate chain to a Go TLS client, causing the client application to crash.
*   The crash occurs due to a panic within the `crypto/x509` library.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote TLS Server:** A malicious TLS server can send the crafted, non-compliant certificate during the TLS handshake.
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited over the network using the TLS protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control a TLS server that communicates with a vulnerable Go client.
*   The attacker needs the ability to send arbitrary certificate chains to the client during the TLS handshake.
*   No specific user interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Go versions 1.18.x prior to 1.18.1.
*   It is specific to macOS systems.
*   The issue was discovered by Tailscale due to "doing weird things".

**Affected Products (from NetApp advisory):**

* BeeGFS CSI Driver

**Unaffected Products (from NetApp advisory):**
* NetApp lists numerous products as not being affected.

**Siemens Advisory:**

*   Siemens also lists this CVE as affecting their "Brownfield Connectivity - Gateway" product in versions before V1.10.1.
*   They note the same CVSS score and impact of DoS and recommend updating to the latest version of the affected product.

**Resolution:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Go version 1.18.1 and 1.17.9.
*   NetApp is advising customers to update or check for updates for affected products.
