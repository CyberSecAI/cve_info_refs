Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Brownﬁeld Connectivity – Gateway collects data from the conﬁgured clients and forwards the data to
other connected systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

We have just released Go versions 1.18.1 and 1.17.9, minor point releases.

These minor releases include three security fixes following the security policy:

* encoding/pem: fix stack overflow in Decode

  A large (more than 5 MB) PEM input can cause a stack overflow in Decode, leading the program to crash.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost who reported the error.

  This is CVE-2022-24675 and <https://go.dev/issue/51853>.

* crypto/elliptic: tolerate all oversized scalars in generic P-256

  A crafted scalar input longer than 32 bytes can cause P256().ScalarMult or P256().ScalarBaseMult to panic. Indirect uses through crypto/ecdsa and crypto/tls are unaffected. amd64, arm64, ppc64le, and s390x are unaffected.

  This was discovered thanks to a Project Wycheproof test vector.

  This is CVE-2022-28327 and <https://go.dev/issue/52075>.

* crypto/x509: non-compliant certificates can cause a panic in Verify on macOS in Go 1.18

  Verifying certificate chains containing certificates which are not compliant with RFC 5280 causes Certificate.Verify to panic on macOS.

  These chains can be delivered through TLS and can cause a crypto/tls or net/http client to crash.

  Thanks to Tailscale for doing weird things and finding this.

  This is CVE-2022-27536 and <https://go.dev/issue/51759>.

View the release notes for more information:
    <https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
    <https://go.dev/dl/>

macOS binary artifacts for Go 1.18.1 are not available at this time due to an [issue](https://go.dev/issue/52317).
We are working on providing them as soon as possible. Sorry for the inconvenience.

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.18.1" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
Dmitri and Cherry for the Go team

# Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202208-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Go, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/go** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18.5** |

### Background

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Go. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Go users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/go-1.18.5"

```

In addition, users using Portage 3.0.9 or later should ensure that packages with Go binaries have no vulnerable code statically linked into their binaries by rebuilding the @golang-rebuild set:

```
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose @golang-rebuild

```
