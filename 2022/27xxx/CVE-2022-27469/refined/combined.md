#### What is Monsta FTP?

Monsta FTP is a web-based FTP client, developed in PHP & AJAX, you can use to manage your website through your browser, edit code, upload and download files, copy/move/delete files and folders - all without installing any desktop software.

#### Why is it better than desktop FTP software?

Monsta FTP is your file manager in the cloud. Traditionally, FTP software is downloaded and/or purchased and installed on the user's desktop. Every time a user upgrades their desktop this process needs to be repeated. In situations where you're using a third-party desktop, such as at an Internet cafe, you may not be able to install your own software. With Monsta FTP you can access your install from any device, anywhere.

#### Is it secure?

We recommend using your Monsta FTP install over SSL to protect your data while transiting your network, however FTP itself is not secure, so we always recommend using Monsta FTP's SFTP/SCP (secure FTP) connection option, where possible.

#### Is it customizable?

With the [Business Edition](/upgrade) you can completely customize the user interface, including: fixing your host address/es; disabling any login form, toolbar, and menu options; restricting access to specific IP addresses; and more. In the [Host Edition](/upgrade) you can also add your own logo and color scheme, and enable logging in directly from your own customer panel.

#### Is it free to use?

Our [Lite Edition](/download) includes basic FTP functionality, like file and folder uploading/downloading, and is free to use, always. If you're looking for more functionality, like on-screen file editing, customizable interface, and rebranding, we have paid [upgrade options](/upgrade) available.
