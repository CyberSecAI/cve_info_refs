**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to unknowingly submit a malicious request.
*   The attacker doesn't need direct access to the WordPress admin panel.
