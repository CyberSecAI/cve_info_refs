The provided content relates to CVE-2022-27984.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `/administrator/templates/default/html/windows/right.php` file of CuppaCMS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.
- The `menu_filter` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, which could lead to:
  - Database information disclosure
  - Data manipulation
  - Potential privilege escalation or full system compromise depending on database configuration and permissions.
  - The attacker could read the entire database and potentially modify it

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `menu_filter` parameter in the URL when accessing the vulnerable `right.php` file.
- The attacker would craft malicious SQL queries embedded in the `menu_filter` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable CuppaCMS application.
- No authentication is mentioned as required for the vulnerable endpoint

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter is `menu_filter`.
- The following payloads are provided in the issue as proof of concept.
  - Boolean true payload: `menu_filter=2' and '1'='1`
  - Boolean false payload: `menu_filter=2' and '1'='2`
  - Exploit payload example: `menu_filter=2'+and(ascii(substr((select(database())),1,1))>50)#`
- The attacker demonstrates the ability to exfiltrate the database name.
