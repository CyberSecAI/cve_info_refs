- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe After Effects.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction (UI:R) is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and requires the user to interact (e.g., by opening a malicious file) with a crafted input that causes the buffer overflow.
