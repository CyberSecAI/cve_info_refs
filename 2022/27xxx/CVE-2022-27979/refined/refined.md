Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper sanitization of user input within the ToolJet application. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied comments in the Job Editor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means that malicious code injected by an attacker is persistently stored within the application and executed when other users interact with the affected component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An authenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through the comment component.
*   When other users interact with the comments 'submenu', the injected JavaScript will be executed within their browser session.
*   This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the comment component of the ToolJet Job Editor.
*   An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of ToolJet.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript within a comment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a valid user with an authenticated session on the ToolJet application.
*   No other special permissions or elevated privileges are explicitly needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates the vulnerability using the following payload: `<img style="visibility:hidden" onerror="console.log\`xss\`" src="__">`
*   This payload uses an `<img>` tag with a non-existent `src` attribute and an `onerror` event handler. The `onerror` handler will execute the provided JavaScript (`console.log('xss')`) when the image fails to load.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is resolved in ToolJet version 1.11.0 or higher.
*   Users are advised to upgrade to the latest version to patch the vulnerability.

**Timeline:**

*   **2022/03/21:** The vulnerability was reported to the developers.
*   **2022/04/22:** A fix was released in version 1.11.0.
