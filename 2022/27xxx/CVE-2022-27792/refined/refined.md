The provided content is a security bulletin from Adobe that includes information about CVE-2022-27792.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write, which allows writing data outside the intended memory bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:** Local access and user interaction are required for successful exploitation. The CVSS vector specifies the attack complexity is low, no privileges are required for the attacker and that a user interaction is required. The specific manner of interaction to trigger the vulnerability is not detailed but the document states that user interaction is required which usually means opening a malformed file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the target system and must be able to trick the user into opening a specially crafted file.
