{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect assumption in the `njs_array_prototype_concat` function, specifically that the 'this' array would always be a fast array when appending a fast array. This assumption was incorrect because previous appends might have converted the 'this' array to a slow form. The function `njs_array_add` expects fast arrays.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect assumption about array type within the `njs_array_prototype_concat` function.",
      "Improper handling of slow arrays when fast arrays are expected by `njs_array_add` function."
    ],
    "impact": "A segmentation fault (SEGV) due to an attempt to write to an invalid memory address which leads to a denial of service. Specifically, this occurs in `memcpy` during the `njs_array_add` operation which is called in the `njs_array_prototype_concat` function.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafting specific JavaScript code that triggers the `concat` method on an array where the `this` array has been converted to a slow form."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute crafted JavaScript code within the NJS environment."

    "affected_components":[
        "NJS (nginx JavaScript module)",
        "njs_array.c",
