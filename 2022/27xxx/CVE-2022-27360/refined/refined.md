- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the use of `${}` in mybatis mapper XML, which directly includes user-controlled input as a SQL attribute name without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  -  SQL Injection: The application constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input within the `${ew.customSqlSegment}`, which is then used to build the where clause of the SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
  -  Lack of input sanitization: The application doesn't validate or sanitize the input before using it to construct SQL queries, allowing for malicious code to be injected.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  -  Arbitrary SQL execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, allowing them to access, modify, or delete sensitive data.
  -  Data exfiltration: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database using techniques like union-based SQL injection.
  -  Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers could cause delays using `sleep()` functions in the query, or potentially crash the system.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - HTTP request parameters: The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP requests to `/api/blade-user/export-user`. Specifically, the 'account' and 'realName' parameters are vulnerable
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  -  The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
  -  Knowledge of the application's API structure and the vulnerable parameters is required.

**More Detail than CVE Description**:
- The provided content details multiple ways to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability, including time-based blind injection using `sleep()`, error-based injection using `updatexml()`, boolean-based blind injection using `if()`, and union-based injection.
- The content shows detailed examples of crafted payloads for each injection method.
- The content provides details on how to exploit the vulnerability through the 'account' parameter and explains how to bypass the parameter precompilation through injection into the parameter name, not just the value.
- The content also shows how to perform union based injection, including bypassing the time-stamp field to retrieve other data
