The provided content contains a commit that introduces a function called `sanitize_xss` to a PHP application. This commit is related to the effort of addressing cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The commit aims to mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Before this commit, user inputs might not have been properly sanitized, leading to potential XSS attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prior to this commit, the application was likely vulnerable to XSS attacks due to a lack of sanitization of user inputs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An XSS vulnerability can allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application which are then executed in the browser of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through any user input fields in the application that were not being sanitized before being displayed to other users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script in any of the vulnerable application's input fields.

The commit introduces the following sanitization function in `app/Util.php`:
```php
public static function sanitize_xss($value)
{
    return htmlspecialchars(strip_tags($value));
}
```
This function uses `strip_tags` to remove HTML and PHP tags, and `htmlspecialchars` to convert special characters to HTML entities, which is designed to prevent the execution of injected scripts in the browser.
