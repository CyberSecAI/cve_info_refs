The provided content is related to the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `unserialize()` without proper restrictions on allowed classes. Specifically, the code was using `@unserialize()` without explicitly setting the `allowed_classes` option. This allows for the deserialization of arbitrary PHP objects, potentially leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe deserialization of user-provided data.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization of serialized data.
- Usage of `@` operator to suppress errors, which might mask potential vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution. An attacker can craft malicious serialized data to be stored and later unserialized, potentially executing arbitrary code on the server.
- Information disclosure/modification depending on the crafted malicious object.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to find endpoints that store data using `serialize()` and later retrieve and `unserialize()` it.
- The attacker crafts malicious serialized data (PHP objects) and submits it to the application to be stored.
- When the application retrieves and unserializes the malicious data, the attacker-controlled code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the application to be serialized and stored.
- The attacker needs to identify the endpoints that subsequently unserialize the stored data.
- No privilege escalation is needed, as the vulnerability occurs due to the lack of input sanitization on the application level.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of PHP object serialization and its potential vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**
The commit addresses this issue by adding a try/catch block and explicitly setting the `allowed_classes` option to `false` when unserializing data. This prevents the deserialization of arbitrary objects, mitigating the risk of remote code execution.
```php
try {
    $unserialised = unserialize($set['reviews'], ['allowed_classes' => false]);
    if ($unserialised !== false) {
      $set['reviews'] = $unserialised;
    }
} catch (Exception $ex) {
    $set['reviews'] = array();
}
```
