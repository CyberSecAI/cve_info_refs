  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The phonograph2 service in Foundry was exposing data in logs, which were being captured by the build2 service. Specifically, RemoteException stacktraces were being treated as 'Safe' content for logging.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information leak due to improper handling of RemoteException stacktraces in logging mechanisms.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exposure of customer data in logs. Arbitrary data could be leaked into logs from vulnerable services.",
  "Attack vectors": "Log analysis of the build2 service. Any service running Spark jobs that result in RemoteException stacktraces could expose customer data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Access to the logs of the build2 service. No specific attacker position described beyond this."
