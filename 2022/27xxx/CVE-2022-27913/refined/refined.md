- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate filtering of potentially malicious user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by other users.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by reflecting user input within the headings of various components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious user input that will be reflected by the application. This could be done through manipulated URLs or other user-controlled parameters.
