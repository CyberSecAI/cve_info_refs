Purchased the PRO version of this plugin and have found it to be exactly what I was looking for. There is nothing out there like it! The backend is extensive and after about 15 minutes of playing around with it, I was able to create and customize the look, feel and function to exactly what I wanted.
In addition, the support was amazing when needed. Very quick and efficient. The creator also updates the plugin often which I love. Always improving it! Would highly recommend!

Lot of very good futures with tons of option, BUT: The UI is terrible at the back- and front end too:- design comes from ages of Netscape Navigator- incredible long options pages without tabs- can’t manage default settings- in the free version can’t hide pro options, what’s have very frustrating green backgroundI spent hours for testing, but I can’t find setting of upload qty limitation – maybe thanks for the ui.This plugin need deep knowledge, but the documentation is very-very pure.This plugin is very potent, but in this form useless for our photoclub.Sorry. We will not buy the pro (and not use the free too).

I started this year with the second Rigid Inflatable Boat Photo Contest based on the plugin. The reasons are:
Adequate after sales support: fast response and always correct solutions.
Client-centered
The jury members find it easy to vote and comment.
A few remarks:
As an admin the UI needs some getting used to.
There are many ways to sort but I would really like to sort alphabetically as well.
The search function needs some attention, it can be more accurate.
Overall
I’ve searched for plugins to have a competition on my website and this one ticks all the boxes for me. Congrats to the developers and the helpdesk.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
