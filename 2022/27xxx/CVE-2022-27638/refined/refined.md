- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Uncontrolled search path element in the Intel Advanced Link Analyzer Pro and Standard edition software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly control the search path used to locate necessary files, allowing an attacker to potentially introduce malicious files in locations where the software searches, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an authenticated user to escalate their privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for exploitation. The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system. The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning the user must perform some action to trigger the vulnerability, such as executing the vulnerable software or performing an action that causes the software to use the manipulated search path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be an authenticated user. The attacker must also be able to place a malicious file in a location where the vulnerable software will search.
