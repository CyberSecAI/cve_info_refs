Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27473:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the erroneous use of the "$" symbol in the `mapper/TopicDao.xml` file, specifically at line 130. This indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability due to improper handling of user input within the SQL query construction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The incorrect usage of the "$" symbol suggests that user-supplied data is directly concatenated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Insecure Query Construction:**  The vulnerability highlights that the application is not using parameterized queries or prepared statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially reading sensitive information such as user passwords (as demonstrated in the provided exploit examples).
- **Data Modification or Deletion:** It could also allow the attacker to modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted user input that is then used to build the SQL query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send malicious input that will be used by the vulnerable query. It appears that the attacker requires no special privileges to exploit this vulnerability, which is likely reachable through a web application user interface.
- The attacker needs to know which input fields are vulnerable.

**More details than the official CVE:**
- The provided content offers specific file and line numbers for the vulnerability location (`mapper/TopicDao.xml:130`).
- It also includes example SQL injection payloads using `extractvalue` and `updatexml` functions to extract the password from the `admin_user` table.
- The content provides screenshots demonstrating the results of the successful exploitation.
