#### We are proud to present the *new* **jDownloads series** **3.9.**This should be your choice when you are starting with jDownloads.

Our aim for the new version is, as far as possible, to support the new and recently added functions of the current Joomla! Version 3.9 and to integrate them into jDownloads.  But it was also necessary to remove or change some of the older parts of jDownloads.  This means that version *3.9* will *not* be backwards compatible with version *3.2*.

If  you are upgrading from an existing *3.2* installation to the new version *3.9.x* please see the **upgrading [guide](https://www.jdownloads.net/documentation-for-v3-9/getting-started-v3-9/upgrading-from-jdownloads-3-2-to-3-9)** (opens in new window/tab).  It is an easy, multistep upgrade, not complicated a migration!

If you are installing jDownloads for the *first time* then see the article **[first time installation](https://www.jdownloads.net/documentation-for-v3-9/getting-started-v3-9/first-time-installation-jd3-9)** (opens in new window/tab).

Developers whose Joomla extensions support jDownloads in any way, or have developed their own plugins or modules for this purpose, will need to rework their extensions a little bit to be compatible with jDownloads 3.9. If you find and [report a bug](/index.php/support-forum.html?board=129.0), we aim to fix it as quickly as possible.  This will be helped when reporting a bug by giving relevant details so we are able to reproduce the problem.

***Important**: This version is not compatible with Joomla 4.x.* A compatible version is in work and will be published in 2022.

#### New major features in version 3.9.x

* The same*look and feel* for the downloads and categories as the articles and categories in Joomla!
* Uses the Joomla! style *Options* in place of the Configuration
* The same *search*, *filtering* and *sort* methods as the core extensions in Joomla!
* Newly designed backend*control panel* with more information together with quick and easy data access
* Reworked and faster *monitoring tool* with many new options in the jDownloads control panel
* Support for Joomla *field groups* and *fields* in jDownloads (replaces the previous jDownloads own custom fields)
* New *multilingual association* function directly in jDownloads
* Wide support for *language placeholders* such as {fr-FR} ... {/fr-FR}  in layouts
* Enhanced support for *single user access* to Downloads
* Support for Joomla! *User Actions Log* function
* Optional *inquiry form* for users to complete before downloading
* Installation checks for overrides, correct Database level and other key issues
* Support for the Joomla Smart Search extension
* Support for RTL languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, etc
* and much more

#### Enhancements

* Improved User Groups Settings layout
* More front end user group settings
* Better Limits setting page in User Groups Settings
* Enhanced Single User Access
* Wide support for language placeholders such as {fr-FR} ... {/fr-FR}  in layouts
* More features in 'Check Downloads' area
* Additional Layouts for jDownloads 3.9
* Planned support for 'modern' style links and for a 'shop' facility

# HackerHood, il gruppo di bug-hunter di RHC emette la prima CVE

[Articoli](https://hackerhood.redhotcyber.com/category/articoli/)
[Aprile 6, 2022](https://hackerhood.redhotcyber.com/2022/04/06/)

* **Ricercatore: [Massimo Chirivì](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mchirivi/)**
* **URL Disclosure: <https://hackerhood.redhotcyber.com/cve-2022-27909-jdownloads>**
* **NVD Link: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-27909>**

[HackerHood](https://hackerhood.redhotcyber.com/), l’iniziativa di Red Hot Cyber che ha unito in un gruppo di hacker etici una serie di ricercatori di sicurezza che effettuano “bug hunting”, ha iniziato a scaldare i motori ed ha emesso la sua prima CVE.

La CVE in questione riguarda jDownloads, un completo Download Manager per il premiato Content Management System (CMS) Joomla. È un’estensione GPL gratuita con molte funzioni speciali che semplifica la gestione dei download.

![](https://www.redhotcyber.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05bc0df7-a060-4d2b-9c00-2bdb38d60f2d-1024x597.jpg)

Pannello di amministrazione di jDownloads

## La vulnerabilità rilevata

La vulnerabilità rilevata era su un componente relativo al noto CMS Joomla. Il componente è stato oggetto di analisi da parte del team di Hackerood durante un’attività di ricerca. La vulnerabilità permette ad un utente registrato di poter visualizzare (ma non scaricare) i nomi dei file riservati di altri utenti.

Una volta rilevata, il ricercatore di sicurezza Massimo Chirivì, ha immediatamente prodotto il report di disclosure inviandolo al vendor, avviando in questo modo la Coordinate Vulnerability Disclosure.

Nel frattempo ha registrato la nuova CVE in stato reserved presso il National Vulnerability Database degli Stati Uniti D’America.

Nel momento in cui scriviamo l’articolo, la vulnerabilità risulta in valutazione della Severity da parte del ***National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)***

## Cosa è HackerHood

All’interno della community di Red Hot Cyber, [prende forma l’iniziativa “HackerHood”](https://hackerhood.redhotcyber.com/).  Si tratta di un gruppo di hacker etici **appassionati di divulgazione e condivisione**, che hanno accettato di far accrescere la consapevolezza al rischio informatico, attraverso una serie di iniziative pratiche.

Tutto questo (in completa aderenza [al manifesto di RHC Communication](https://www.redhotcyber.com/manifesto/)), consentirà di incentivare le persone alla condivisione delle informazioni, in modo professionale ed etico, promuovendo innovazione e ricerca in ambito IT.

L’Open Source “invece” ci ha insegnato che questo modello ha il suo valore per un tempo limitato e che dopo è costretto a sgretolarsi; questo perché molte persone non hanno compreso che **“condividere è un dovere etico” per ognuno di noi,** ovvero mettere a disposizione le proprie esperienze per consentire alla community di innalzare il livello di consapevolezza al rischio informatico, e questo non è mai stato tanto vero come in questo difficile periodo storico, soprattutto in Italia.

Le iniziative che sono state previste all’interno di Hacker Hood in questo momento sono le seguenti:

1. **Divulgazione tecnico scientifica:** redazione di guide e tutorial per poter far accrescere la cultura nell’ethical hacking, con dei corsi pratici anche per i neofiti, in modo da far appassionare i più piccoli e far scattare quella “scintilla” che permetterà di hackerare il loro e il nostro futuro;
2. **Analisi di sicurezza in regime “responsible disclosure”:** effettuare attività di analisi sulla sicurezza perimetrale delle aziende pubbliche/private italiane, qualora abbiano attivato una politica di “responsible disclosure”. Tale modello permetterà di migliorare la cyber-posture delle aziende, oltre che fornire un ritorno in termini di sicurezza informatica delle infrastrutture italiane;
3. **Ricerca di vulnerabilità non documentate:**effettuare attività di bug hunting su prodotti eterogenei, con lo scopo di individuare nuove falle di sicurezza, dando modo alle aziende di aggiornarli prima della pubblicazione della vulnerabilità. Tale attività si svolgerà in pieno regime di Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD).

Questo modello open source, **consente di superare la logica del titolo di studio e della certificazione** in ambito technical assessment, lasciando spazio ai singoli tester**di dimostrare in campo** il proprio valore e le proprie capacità, fornendo nel contempo a tutta la community italiana ed internazionale un grande servizio, oltre che ad un messaggio molto profondo.

Tutti vedono oggi la cybersecurity come un business, un modello di espansione, quando invece la cybersecurity è collettività, collaborazione, etica e incentivazione. Si tratta di un bene di primaria necessità come l’acqua e il pane ed è per questo che Hacker Hood vuole sottrarre un po’ di business dalle aziende, regalando il nostro sapere alla comunità, in quanto tutti oggi tutti devono avere accesso alla conoscenza del rischio informatico.

RHC sta gettando un “piccolo seme” in un terreno poco fertile, con la speranza che possa germogliare anche con un cielo gonfio di nuvole nere e di piogge acide.

Per poter partecipare al programma, devi essere in possesso di esperienze in ambito Pentesting , developement exploit, bug hunting e malware analysis ed inviarle alla casella di posta **redhotcyber@hotmail.com**.
