Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27909:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the jDownloads component for Joomla, specifically related to how it handles file access permissions for registered users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is that a registered user could view the names of files that were meant to be restricted to other users. This indicates a failure in proper access control mechanisms within the jDownloads component. While users could see the filenames, they could not download the files themselves, according to the provided content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to information disclosure, as filenames of restricted files are exposed to unauthorized users, potentially revealing sensitive information about the available files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a registered user browsing the jDownloads component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered user on the Joomla website using the vulnerable jDownloads component. No specific administrative or higher privileges are required; they only need a valid account.
