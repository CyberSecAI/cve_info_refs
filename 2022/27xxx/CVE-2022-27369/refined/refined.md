Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `news_News.php_hy` file of the Cscms music portal system v4.2. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the GET request to restore articles from the recycle bin is not properly sanitized, leading to SQL injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL blind injection. The application directly uses user-supplied input (`id` parameter) in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by crafting SQL injection payloads.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** It could allow an attacker to modify or delete data in the database, which includes, but is not limited to, news articles, user information, and configurations.
    *   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** In some cases, depending on the database configuration and permissions, a successful SQL injection might be leveraged to achieve remote code execution.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `/admin.php/news/admin/news/hy` endpoint, specifically targeting the `id` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have administrator login access to the Cscms portal to perform operations required to move and restore articles from the recycle bin.
    *   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some level of SQL knowledge to craft the injection payloads.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

1.  **Vulnerability Location:** `news_News.php_hy` file in Cscms v4.2.
2.  **Injection Point:** The `id` parameter in a GET request when restoring a deleted news article.
3.  **Payload Example:** The provided example `GET /admin.php/news/admin/news/hy?id=5)and(sleep(5))--+` demonstrates a blind SQL injection using the `sleep()` function to confirm the vulnerability and the `--+` to comment out the remainder of the query
4.  **Vulnerable Code:** The provided screenshot of the source code `\News::hy` is where the unsanitized user controlled 'id' parameter is used.

**Summary**

The content provided highlights a SQL blind injection vulnerability in the Cscms music portal system v4.2. The vulnerability allows an attacker with admin access to inject SQL code into a database query by manipulating the `id` parameter when restoring articles from the recycle bin. This can lead to data exfiltration, manipulation, or potentially remote code execution.
