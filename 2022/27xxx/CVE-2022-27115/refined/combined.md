| **Describe the bug** Filename bypass leading to Remote Code Execution  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:   1. Upload a file with `a<?php phpinfo();?>` named shell.php, Note: the letter 'a' at the beginning of the content cannot be omitted. 2. Add two dots after the file name like this `shell.php..`. 3. The shell file is successfully uploaded by bypassing detection and can be accessed via `files/shell.php`. 4. This vulnerability can only be exploited on windows systems.   **Screenshots** [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56918579/154855112-eb89c442-5a07-4165-91b3-2de41d7c7bd7.png)  **Desktop (please complete the following information):**   * OS: Windows |

| Hi there,  It did indeed create a `shell.php` file on the filesystem but the file is empty. Do you have the same problem ?  Elfinder version : 2.1.60 |

| [@Bingoyyj](https://github.com/Bingoyyj) It seems that the Windows server treats it as if there is no dot at the end of the file name. However, the control with the extension doesn't seem to work, so I'll fix this. |
