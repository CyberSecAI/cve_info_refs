How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I’ve been using The Events Calendar for years. Since I am redesigning my site I thought I would try MEC — it has features that requires coding experience to get in TEC.
I can’t even get the basics going on it. Features are missing and support is useless, unless going in circles is your thing.
Their admin demo last for only two hours so you will be stuck asking support a bunch of questions and reading answers that do not apply to your question; or, answering your own questions by buying add-ons with the intent of getting refund after you figure it out.
I think I will stick with TEC and get someone on fiverr for some customization

If you are going to use the calendar, just as a calendar, then ok. But the moment you want to start integrating things, then everything goes wrong. The new version does not work with gravity forms installed, site breaks. Even their own plugins do not work well together, the API plugin and the divi builder module, 2 of their own plugins, break each other and you site looks like total garbage. The tickets and invoice module is useless as far as invoices go and their woocommerce plugin basically does what it wants after each update, deleting entries, eliminating paypal keys etc. the list goes on. Support is mainly a bot, when they do get back to you, they ask you to describe the issue IN DETAIL, I don’t have the time to do your work, test your stuff before you send out updates. Every update just causes chaos, which then takes hours to fix. Perhaps I should bill you for my time as well. Avoid these plugins where possible.

Just spent nearly 3 weeks going around and around with their support team on an issue we were having with their Facebook Import/Export as well as the Google Calendar Synchronization with no resolution.
We’ve had a paid license for over 2 years now and waited sometimes for days for an answer from them that was subpar at best. The plugin has always had issues and functionality constantly shifts, causing you to grow increasingly impatient as they gaslight you into thinking that “the plugin never worked like that”.
Such a waste of time. Moving to a different solution. Good riddance.

despite the Free plug-in M.E. Calendars Lite is a good app and offers lot of functionality. It would be a benchmark to other so called Free Plug-ins.
Not only the software is good, but also the Support! even the M.E. Calendar Lite support is swift and good.
All comments above are based on experiences we have had during a year with a non Profit Website.
Go for a commercial calendar? than GO the Professional Plug-in! M.E. Calendar the best and hope wil become leading in future!
