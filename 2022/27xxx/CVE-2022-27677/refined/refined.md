- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Failure to validate privileges during the installation of AMD Ryzen Master.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate privilege validation during installation allows modification of files.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A low-privileged attacker can modify files, potentially leading to privilege escalation and code execution with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs during the installation process of the AMD Ryzen Master software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have low-level privileges on the system where AMD Ryzen Master is being installed.
