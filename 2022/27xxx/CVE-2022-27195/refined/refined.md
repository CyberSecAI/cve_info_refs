Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Parameterized Trigger Plugin captures environment variables, including password parameters, passed to builds.
*   These values are then stored unencrypted in the `build.xml` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unencrypted Storage:** Sensitive data (passwords) are stored in plain text, making them easily accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the unencrypted password parameters.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** Attackers require access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the `build.xml` files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins Controller Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the file system of the Jenkins controller to read the files. This is typically restricted, but could be accomplished through compromised accounts, or via other vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory indicates the plugin version 2.43.1 addresses the issue by not storing these values.
* Existing build.xml files will not be updated.
*  The plugin will report environment variables stored in `build.xml` as unloadable data in the Old Data Monitor.

This analysis provides more details than the initial CVE description, specifically outlining the method of storage, the location of the sensitive data, and the actions taken to resolve the vulnerability.
