{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The BattlEye service, BEService, has an unquoted service path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unquoted service path",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local user can insert malicious code in a directory within the service path, which could potentially be executed during application startup or reboot with elevated privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access. An attacker needs to be able to place an executable in the path before the service executable.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access with the ability to write to a directory within the service path."
