Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.19.1 and 1.18.6, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 2 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: handle server errors after sending GOAWAY

  A closing HTTP/2 server connection could hang forever waiting for a clean shutdown that was preempted by a subsequent fatal error. This failure mode could be exploited to cause a denial of service.

  Thanks to Bahruz Jabiyev, Tommaso Innocenti, Anthony Gavazzi, Steven Sprecher, and Kaan Onarlioglu for reporting this.

  This is CVE-2022-27664 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/54658>.
* net/url: JoinPath does not strip relative path components in all circumstances

  JoinPath and URL.JoinPath would not remove ../ path components appended to a relative path. For example, JoinPath("<https://go.dev>", "../go") returned the URL <https://go.dev/../go>, despite the JoinPath documentation stating that ../ path elements are cleaned from the result.

  Thanks to @q0jt for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-32190 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/54385>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.19.1>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.19.1` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Michael and Heschi for the Go team

## Description

![@neild](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/52544?u=41bff20219d93918578944360c3930f30df4693b&v=4&size=48)[neild](https://github.com/neild)opened [on Aug 24, 2022](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/54658#issue-1349837521)

A closing HTTP/2 server connection could hang forever waiting for a clean shutdown that was preempted by a subsequent fatal error. This failure mode could be exploited to cause a denial of service.

Thanks to Bahruz Jabiyev, Tommaso Innocenti, Anthony Gavazzi, Steven Sprecher, and Kaan Onarlioglu for reporting this.

This was a PRIVATE issue for [CVE-2022-27664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-69cg-p879-7622 "CVE-2022-27664") tracked in <http://b/219507101>.

Backport issues: [#53977](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/53977) [#54376](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/54376)

(I forgot to create the non-backport issue when making the backports, doing so now.)
