Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `net/http` package of the Go programming language. Specifically, a closing HTTP/2 server connection could enter a hung state. This occurs when a clean shutdown is initiated but is then preempted by a subsequent fatal error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hanging Connection:** The core weakness is the server's inability to properly handle errors after sending a GOAWAY frame, leading to a persistent hang. This means a closing HTTP/2 connection can get stuck indefinitely.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to hang, preventing it from handling new connections or requests and effectively making the server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves exploiting the HTTP/2 connection closing sequence. It requires triggering a specific sequence of events where a clean shutdown is initiated, and then a fatal error occurs which prevents proper termination of the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the vulnerable server. Specifically, the attacker would need to be able to establish and close HTTP/2 connections with the targeted server.
*   **HTTP/2 knowledge:** the attacker must understand the intricacies of HTTP/2 connection closing mechanism.
