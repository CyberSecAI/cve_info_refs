Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `dance_Dance.php_hyDetails` functionality of the Cscms music portal system v4.2. This vulnerability is triggered when restoring songs from the recycle bin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`id` parameter) when constructing SQL queries, leading to a blind SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries ( demonstrated by extracting the database name).
- **Data Manipulation:**  An attacker might be able to modify or delete database records if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `/admin.php/dance/admin/dance/hy` endpoint, specifically manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be logged into the administrator panel of the Cscms music portal system.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker must know the vulnerable URL and the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL statements.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit examples use time-based blind SQL injection, by using `sleep()` function and `if()` conditions in SQL to verify the injection is working and perform information extraction.
- The vulnerability exists in the `dance/admin/dance/hy` functionality and is triggered while restoring songs from the trash.
