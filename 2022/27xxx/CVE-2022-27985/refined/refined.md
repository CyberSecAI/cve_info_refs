Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-27985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an SQL injection that stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `params[group]` parameter in the `/administrator/alerts/alertLightbox.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses user-supplied input within an SQL query without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Disclosure:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, allowing them to potentially access and disclose all data stored in the database, including sensitive information.
- **Database Manipulation:**  The attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into the `params[group]` parameter of the HTTP GET request sent to `/administrator/alerts/alertLightbox.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic HTTP Understanding:** The attacker needs to be able to construct HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
