- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit has a service listening on UDP port 55050 that allows for submission of XCMDs (commands). This service does not perform any authentication checks and dispatches the received XCMDs to the same function used by the trusted XMPP connection, which does perform authentication checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control (CWE-284). The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication on the UDP/55050 service. The device assumes that all commands received over the XMPP connection are authentic and trustworthy. This assumption is extended to the UDP service, allowing for unauthenticated command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can send a malicious XML payload to the UDP/55050 port to execute arbitrary XCMDs, leading to several negative security impacts. The attacker can arm/disarm the system, read/write sensitive configuration values, reboot the device, enable the local web interface, and change the local web interfaceâ€™s administrative account username and password.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An unauthenticated attacker who can communicate to the UDP/55050 port of the device can send arbitrary XCMDs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device and be able to communicate with it on UDP port 55050. No authentication is required.
