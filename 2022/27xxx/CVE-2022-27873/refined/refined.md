Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Autodesk Fusion 360 parses SVG files, specifically during the 'Insert SVG' procedure. It allows an attacker to inject malicious XML External Entities (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **XXE Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection flaw. The application improperly handles external entities within the SVG file, allowing an attacker to potentially control the data being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary HTTP Requests:** An attacker can force the victim's device to perform arbitrary HTTP requests in the Wide Area Network (WAN).
-   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially obtain the victim's public IP address and possibly other sensitive information.
-   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability could potentially lead to remote code execution on the affected system.
-   **Denial-of-Service:** Exploitation could lead to denial-of-service attacks against the software and the user's device.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Malicious SVG Files:** The attack vector involves using specially crafted SVG files containing malicious XML external entities.
-   **'Insert SVG' Procedure:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user attempts to insert the malicious SVG file using the 'Insert SVG' function within Autodesk Fusion 360.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to craft malicious SVG files.**
-   **Ability to have the victim open a crafted SVG file using the affected function.**
