Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-27378:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `Create_tmp_table::finalize` function in MariaDB. Specifically, it is triggered when a temporary table is created as part of a `SELECT DISTINCT` query with a combination of `DEFAULT` function calls in the SELECT list. The issue arises due to incorrect handling of temporary table creation and finalization, leading to a crash during the `finalize` step.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of temporary tables during complex queries involving `DISTINCT` and `DEFAULT` function calls.
- Memory corruption or access violation during the finalization of the temporary table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the MariaDB server, effectively denying service to users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a specific SQL query involving `CREATE TABLE`, `SHOW DATABASES`, and `SELECT DISTINCT` operations with specific `DEFAULT` function calls. This can be triggered by a malicious user or application that is able to submit such a query to a vulnerable MariaDB instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to send SQL queries to a vulnerable MariaDB server. No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, based on the provided details.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects MariaDB versions through 10.7.
- The specific problematic SQL query is provided in the `MDEV-26423` issue description:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE v0 ( v2 DATE DEFAULT ( v1 MOD 68321183.000000 ) , v1 DATETIME NULL ) ;
  SHOW DATABASES LIKE 'x' ;
  SELECT DISTINCT v2 , v1 , DEFAULT ( v2 ) FROM v0 ;
  ```
- The crash occurs during the execution of the final `SELECT DISTINCT` query.
- The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20220526-0004) lists this CVE along with others as affecting MariaDB instances incorporated in their products but explicitly notes that none of their listed products are vulnerable to this CVE.
- Debian also lists this CVE as being fixed in their mariadb-10.3 update (DLA 3114-1).
