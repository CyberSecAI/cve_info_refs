Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding of user-supplied data in various parameters within the application's admin interface. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the application's response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Multiple **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities are present.
- The application does not properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input before displaying it in the HTML output.
- Vulnerable parameters include `select`, `input`, `wd`, and `repeat` in different admin panel URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session, typically a logged-in administrator.
- This could lead to:
  - Cookie theft: The attacker can steal administrator cookies, gaining full control over the application.
  - Session hijacking: The attacker can impersonate the administrator and perform malicious actions.
  - Data exfiltration: The attacker can steal sensitive data from the application.
  - Defacement: The attacker can modify the appearance of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters.
- The attacker must entice a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious URL. This could be done through phishing or other social engineering tactics.
- The attacker can also use other techniques such as network interception, or injecting malicious code through other vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must identify the vulnerable parameters and craft malicious URLs.
- The attacker needs to somehow lure a logged-in administrator to click on the malicious URLs.

**Vulnerable Versions:**
- The vulnerabilities affect versions v2021.1000.1081 up to v2022.1000.3029.

**Specific Vulnerable URLs and Parameters:**
- `<http://127.0.0.1/maccms10/admin.php/admin/art/data.html?select=&input=&type=&status=&level=&lock=&pic=&order=&wd=>` (Affected parameters: `select` & `input`)
- `<http://127.0.0.1/maccms10/admin.php/admin/website/data.html?select=&input=&type=&status=&level=&lock=&pic=&order=&wd=>` (Affected parameters: `select` & `input`)
- `<http://127.0.0.1/maccms10/admin.php/admin/plog/index.html?type=&wd=>` (Affected parameter: `wd`)
- `<http://127.0.0.1/maccms10/admin.php/admin/ulog/index.html?mid=&type=&wd=>` (Affected parameter: `wd`)
- `<http://127.0.0.1/maccms10/admin.php/admin/vod/data.html?repeat=>` (Affected parameter: `repeat`)

**Mitigation:**
- The suggested repair methods are:
  -  HTML escaping input data to prevent it from being recognized as an executable script.
  - Filtering input data against a whitelist of allowed tags and attributes, removing executable script elements like `<script>` tags and `onerror` attributes.
