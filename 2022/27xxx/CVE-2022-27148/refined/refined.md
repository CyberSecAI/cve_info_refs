Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Signed integer overflow

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The code in `media_tools/av_parsers.c` at line 5271 performs a multiplication operation where the result exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a signed integer. Specifically, the multiplication `160041545 * 16`, `551209680 * 16`, and `414855863 * 16` results in an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The signed integer overflow leads to a runtime error detected by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
*   The program crashes with an "Aborted (core dumped)" error, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file.
*   The specific input files `poc_file`, `poc_3`, `poc_9`, and `poc_19` are mentioned as triggering the crashes. `poc.zip` is a later version.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to provide a malicious MP4 file that, when processed by `MP4Box`, causes the overflow.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute `MP4Box` with the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was detected using UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
*   The issue was reported on Jan 26, 2022, and a fix was committed on Jan 27, 2022, with commit hash `0cd19f4`.
*   The affected GPAC version is 1.1.0-DEV-rev1663-g881c6a94a-master.
* The issue occurs in the function parsing media files (`media_tools/av_parsers.c`).
* The `poc.zip` contains the correct test files.
