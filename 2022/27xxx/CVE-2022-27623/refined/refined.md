- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function in the iSCSI management functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication leading to arbitrary file read/write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can read or write arbitrary files on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Unspecified vectors via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required, but the attack complexity is high
