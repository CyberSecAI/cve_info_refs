Thanks to [@uncomfyhalomacro](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro) who packaged swhkd from open suse repos, a [multitude of security vulnerabilities](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/14/1) were discovered by [@mgerstner](https://github.com/mgerstner) which primarily arose due to my incompetence and lack of careful review of all pull requests. I apologize for this.

The following CVE's have been fixed in this release:

```
CVE-2022-27815
CVE-2022-27814
CVE-2022-27819
CVE-2022-27818
CVE-2022-27816

```

Only [CVE-2022-27817](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h5wh-7h2j-h999 "CVE-2022-27817") remains as it is a genuinely difficult problem to solve for us right now. After a short conversation with Kenny Levinsen ( author of seatd ) we came to the conclusion that it's not possible to get access of a seat without complete control of the session hence any compositor which is launched after swhkd won't work. We can however get the fd's of the devices, release the seat, and then pass it along to evdev but that will require a complete application rewrite.

[@mgerstner](https://github.com/mgerstner) did suggest to try systemd context switching with elogind for supporting various inits. As far as I can tell this implementation will have a time complexity of O(2^n) so as the number of seats increase, swhkd will start to lag because there is a considerable amount of cold start to swhkd after which the application runs fine.

I'd also like to point out that the above solution will **NOT** be portable. Distributions that decide to not build elogind support into their init systems will not be able to run swhkd and hence it's not a path that I'd fancy even if it were to fix the problem.

For now [CVE-2022-27817](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h5wh-7h2j-h999 "CVE-2022-27817") will probably remain stale. For single user ( single seat ) systems swhkd will function just fine.

Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in swhkd hotkey helper for Wayland

Hello list,

swhkd [1] is a pair of programs that allow to configure arbitrary
keyboard hotkey definitions for the Wayland graphics system, written in
the Rust programming language. The RPM package integration
submitted for openSUSE Tumbleweed contained an unusual Polkit rules
definition file that required a review by the SUSE security team [2].

As a result of the review multiple security issues have been identified.
The individual issues are described in the following detailed report.

1) Introduction
===============

1.a) swhkd Design and Operation
-------------------------------

swhkd consists of two components: `swhks` ("server") which runs in the
context of the unprivileged user to execute hotkey actions and `swhkd`
("daemon") which runs with root privileges to interact with keyboard
devices on uinput API level. The two components communicate with each
other via a UNIX domain socket.

It is a bit unclear if `swhkd` allows other modes of operation. The
function `permission_check()` is somewhat confusing in this regard. In
the end the only way to get it running is doing it as root, and the
README also points to `pkexec` for running it. So this is the only setup
that I analyzed for this report.

1.b) Scope of Review
--------------------

The target of this review was version 1.1.5 of swhkd.

1.c) Polkit pkexec Usage
========================

In version 1.1.5 of swhkd a Polkit rules file
"/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/swhkd.rules" is used containing the
following rule snippet:

```
polkit.addRule(function(action, subject) {
      if (action.lookup("program") == "/usr/bin/swhkd") {
                return polkit.Result.YES;
      }
})
```

This means that any user in the system independently of a session
context is able to execute /usr/bin/swhkd as root via pkexec passing
arbitrary parameters e.g. also a compromised 'nobody' user account could
do it.

According to my recommendation upstream switched to using a Polkit
policy file instead that only allows local users in an active session to
run swhkd as root.

2) Security Issues
==================

2.a) Use of Fixed Temporary File in /tmp/swhkd.pid (CVE-2022-27815)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The daemon running as root uses this path to record its own PID for
instance monitoring. This fixed path has the following issues:

- local application DoS: if an attacker places the PID of an existing
  process there (e.g. PID 1), other users cannot start the daemon any
  more.

- local information leak if the kernel's symlink protection is turned
  off. The daemon logs the *full* content of the PID file to stdout.
  Example output of a run with a symlink pointing to a private root
  owned file containing the string "secret":

      [2022-03-21T15:44:28Z DEBUG swhkd] Previous PID: secret

- local system DoS if kernel symlink protection is off. The daemon will
  overwrite the target file with its own PID. This could also create a
  world-readable file in interesting locations that allow for further
  attack vectors in other programs.

- functional issue: such a setup is not suitable for multiple users
  using the software in parallel.

### Bugfix

The issue has been fixed upstream via the following commit:

<https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/pull/93/commits/ee3534b401cba71fddf378f7e1cb18ada0e6fa75>

The PID file is now placed into /etc, which fixes the issue, albeit is
an incorrect location. I suggested upstream to place this file in /run
instead.

2.b) The `-c` Daemon Command Line Parameter Allows for Arbitrary File Existence Tests (CVE-2022-27814)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example exploitation:

    $ pkexec /usr/bin/swhkd -d -c /root/.somefile
    [2022-03-22T12:32:25Z ERROR swhkd] "/root/.somefile" doesn't exist

    $ pkexec /usr/bin/swhkd -d -c /root/.bash_history
    [...] (daemon starts "normal" operation)

### Bugfix

Upstream tries to fix this via the following commit:

<https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/pull/105/commits/3c111663f2dcf8f28214ff1907169aa669fcf791>

This commit now uses the external `cat` program to read in the
configuration file. Actually this is just a workaround, because the fix
for issue 2.c) is incomplete (only the root UID is dropped, not the root
GID, see [3]).

2.c) The `-c` Daemon Command Line Parameter Allows to Parse Arbitrary Files (CVE-2022-27819)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The file passed to `swhkd` via `-c` will be completely read in by
`swhkd`. Any privileged file can thus also be processed. The daemon only
outputs the contents if something that looks like a hotkey definition is
found in the file, however. Since this syntax is pretty complex the
involved information leak is rather hard to exploit. Something like

    $ pkexec /usr/bin/swhkd -d -c /dev/sda

causes the daemon to "parse" the complete block device, exhausting
memory and causing high I/O load.

### Bugfix

Upstream addressed this by dropping privileges to the invoking user via
the following commit:

<https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/8ddd40fdc0f1a356816671d6a91f067c112e4724>

The privilege drop is still incomplete, because the root group ID
privilege is not dropped.

The security stance of swhkd can still be improved by dropping
privileges to the invoking user by default and only raising them for
privileged operations. I recommended this to upstream for follow up
changes of the codebase.

2.d) The Daemon Connects to a Fixed UNIX Domain Socket in /tmp/swhkd.sock (CVE-2022-27818)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For connecting to the unprivileged swhks sibbling process the swhkd
daemon connects to the fixed domain socket path /tmp/swhkd.sock. This
causes the following issues:

- local DoS: If an attacker pre-creates this pathname then the daemon
  cannot send out hotkey events and the unprivileged server component
  cannot start up successfully.
- local information leak: If an attacker places its *own* UNIX domain
  socket there, then the attacker will receive hotkey events instead of
  the legitimate user. The information contains the commands to be
  executed which is depending on the actual hotkey setup. In some cases
  this might even contain sensitive data.

### Bugfix

Upstream addressed this by placing the socket into the unprivileged
user's private /run/user/$UID directory. This is done via the following
commit:

<https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/3187d7fc75fe5833f903b342941eebc1a56e5979>

2.e) Input Events are Consumed For all Keyboard Input Devices in all Sessions (CVE-2022-27817)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The daemon listens for input events on uinput device level. This means
even other users in other Wayland sessions or on the text mode consoles
will be affected by this. In theory this fact could be used to log
passwords and other sensitive information from other users. However,
recognized hotkey events will be discarded by the daemon i.e. if regular
key presses are configured as hotkeys then the keys seem to work no
longer. Therefore it is more like a local DoS for other users.

### Bugfix

This issue has not been addressed by upstream yet. My suggested fix is
as follows:

Establish a systemd Session Context: I think it is possible to determine
the current session the unprivileged user is in via systemd. Then the
daemon should pause its operation as soon as the active session is
changed to another one, and reactivate operation once the original user
session becomes active again.

2.f) The Unprivileged Server Process Uses a Fixed Temporary File in /tmp/swhks.pid (CVE-2022-27816)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This issue is similar to 2.a). The consequences are:

- local application DoS: if an attacker places the PID of an existing
  process there (e.g. PID 1), other users cannot start the server any
  more.
- local user file corruption: if kernel symlink protection is off, then
  the PID file can be a symlink to a private file in the user's home
  directory which will then be overwritten with the PID information.

### Bugfix

Upstream addressed this issue by placing the PID file in the respective
user's private /run/user/$UID directory. This is done in the following
commit:

<https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/4b8442fef512441c9155186956c767a120c12974>

2.g) The Unprivileged Server Process Receives Commands via /tmp/swhkd.sock
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The socket used by the daemon (see 2.d) is created by the unprivileged
server. The daemon sends commands to be executed to this socket and the
server will execute them.

The UNIX socket `bind()` call only succeeds if the target file does not
exist yet and it also doesn't follow symlinks. Therefore an attacker
cannot pre-create this socket, without the server process failing to
`bind()`. For `connect()`ing to the socket the caller needs to have
write permissions on the socket. Therefore arbitrary other users cannot
send commands to the server process if a _sane_ umask is configured.

Should the user starting the server process *not* have a sane umask,
however, then the socket could become writable for other users and
therefore other users could execute arbitrary code in the context of the
unprivileged user:

    $ umask 0
    $ swhks &
    $ ls -lh /tmp/swhkd.sock
    srwxrwxrwx 1 mgerstner users 0 Mär 22 13:46 /tmp/swhkd.sock

Since an overly open umask is an issue in itself I did not request a CVE
for this issue.

### Bugfix

To protect against this scenario the socket file is now placed in the
respective user's private /run/user/$UID directory. Furthermore for
hardening purposes a sane umask is applied. The following upstream
commit contains this change:

<https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/commit/707ea9915c9cf3d68b4a6729ac212a46a486e3fd>

3) Timeline
===========

- 2022-03-22: I reported these findings to upstream privately. I offered
  formal coordinated disclosure, no defined embargo and publication date
  have been established though.
- 2022-03-23: Upstream started quickly to work on bugfixes which have
  been published on GitHub right away. Therefore increasing parts of the
  information has become public over time.
- 2022-03-24: I received CVEs for the issues from Mitre and communicated
  them to upstream.
- 2022-04-13: I asked upstream for permission to publish the full
  report, since most CVEs have already public fixes, some of them still
  incomplete though.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

[Swhkd 1.2.0 ( CVE fix edition )](/waycrate/swhkd/releases/tag/1.2.0)

Thanks to [@uncomfyhalomacro](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro) who packaged swhkd from open suse repos, a [multitude of security vulnerabilities](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/14/1) were discovered by [@mgerstner](https://github.com/mgerstner) which primarily arose due to my incompetence and lack of careful review of all pull requests. I apologize for this.

The following CVE's have been fixed in this release:

```
CVE-2022-27815
CVE-2022-27814
CVE-2022-27819
CVE-2022-27818
CVE-2022-27816

```

Only [CVE-2022-27817](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h5wh-7h2j-h999 "CVE-2022-27817") remains as it is a genuinely difficult problem to solve for us right now. After a short conversation with Kenny Levinsen ( author of seatd ) we came to the conclusion that it's not possible to get access of a seat without complete control of the session hence any compositor which is launched after swhkd won't work. We can however get the fd's of the devices, release the seat, and then pass it along to evdev but that will require a complete application rewrite.

[@mgerstner](https://github.com/mgerstner) did suggest to try systemd context switching with elogind for supporting various inits. As far as I can tell this implementation will have a time complexity of O(2^n) so as the number of seats increase, swhkd will start to lag because there is a considerable amount of cold start to swhkd after which the application runs fine.

I'd also like to point out that the above solution will **NOT** be portable. Distributions that decide to not build elogind support into their init systems will not be able to run swhkd and hence it's not a path that I'd fancy even if it were to fix the problem.

For now [CVE-2022-27817](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-h5wh-7h2j-h999 "CVE-2022-27817") will probably remain stale. For single user ( single seat ) systems swhkd will function just fine.

## SWHKD

**S**imple **W**ayland **H**ot**K**ey **D**aemon

`swhkd` is a display protocol-independent hotkey daemon made in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). `swhkd` uses an easy-to-use configuration
system inspired by `sxhkd`, so you can easily add or remove hotkeys.

It also attempts to be a drop-in replacement for `sxhkd`, meaning your `sxhkd`
config file is also compatible with `swhkd`.

Because `swhkd` can be used anywhere, the same `swhkd` config can be used across
Xorg or Wayland desktops, and you can even use `swhkd` in a TTY.

## Installation and Building

[Installation and building instructions can be found here.](/waycrate/swhkd/blob/main/INSTALL.md)

## Running

```
swhks &
swhkd
```

## Runtime signals

After opening `swhkd`, you can control the program through signals:

* `sudo pkill -USR1 swhkd` — Pause key checking
* `sudo pkill -USR2 swhkd` — Resume key checking
* `sudo pkill -HUP swhkd` — Reload config file

## Configuration

`swhkd` closely follows `sxhkd` syntax, so most existing `sxhkd` configs should
be functional with `swhkd`.
More information about the sxhkd syntax can be found in the official man pages from the [arch wiki](https://man.archlinux.org/man/sxhkd.1).

The default configuration file is in `~/.config/swhkd/swhkdrc` with a fallback to `etc/swhkd/swhkdrc`.

If you use Vim, you can get `swhkd` config syntax highlighting with the
[swhkd-vim](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd-vim) plugin. Install it in
vim-plug with `Plug 'waycrate/swhkd-vim'`.

All supported key and modifier names are listed in `man 5 swhkd-keys`.

## Environment Variables

The environment variables are now sourced using the SWHKS binary, running in the background which are then supplemented
to the command that is to be run, thus emulating the environment variables in the default shell.

The commands are executed via *SHELL -c 'command'*, hence the environment is sourced from the default shell.
If the user wants to use a different set of environment variables, they can set the environment variables
in the default shell or export the environment variables within a logged in instance of their shell before
running the SWHKS binary.

## Autostart

### To autostart `swhkd` you can do one of two things

1. Add the commands from the ["Running"
   section](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd#running) to your window managers
   configuration file.
2. Enable the [service
   file](https://github.com/waycrate/swhkd/tree/main/contrib/init) for your
   respective init system. Currently, only systemd and OpenRC service files
   exist and more will be added soon including Runit.

## Security

We use a server-client model to keep you safe. The daemon (`swhkd` — privileged
process) is responsible for listening to key events and running shell commands.
The server (`swhks` — non-privileged process) is responsible for keeping a track of the
environment variables and sending them to the daemon. The daemon
uses these environment variables while running the shell commands.
The daemon only runs shell commands that have been parsed from the config file and there is no way to
run arbitrary shell commands. The server is responsible for only sending the environment variables to the daemon and nothing else.
This separation of responsibilities ensures security.

So yes, you're safe!
