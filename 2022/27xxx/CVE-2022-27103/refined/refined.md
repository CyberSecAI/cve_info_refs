{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2022-27103",
    "description": "element-plus below 2.0.5 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) when attribute `show-tooltips-overflow` of `el-table-column` is true. The mouseover action will make the text of this column render as html.",
    "affected_versions": "< 2.0.6",
    "patched_versions": "2.0.6",
    "root_cause": "The `el-table-column` component, when `show-tooltips-overflow` is set to true, renders the column's text content as HTML when the user hovers over it. This behavior allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code if the text content contains malicious HTML.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper neutralization of input during web page generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the user's browser session. This could allow an attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing web pages.",
    "attack_vector": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to inject malicious HTML code into the data that is displayed in the `el-table-column`.",
    "user_interaction": "User interaction is required as the XSS is triggered upon mouseover of the table cell.",
