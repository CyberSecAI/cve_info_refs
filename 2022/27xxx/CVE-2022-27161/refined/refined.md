Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and usage of non-parameterized SQL queries. Specifically, the `viewUsers` function in `cszcms/controllers/admin/Members.php`, uses unsanitized input in an SQL query in `cszcms/models/Csz_admin_model.php::getUser`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data manipulation:** An attacker could potentially read or modify data in the database, which could lead to data breaches, data corruption, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Database takeover:** With sufficient database privileges, an attacker may be able to drop tables or entire databases.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/index.php/admin/Members/viewUsers/` endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** A payload is inserted into the URL which is then used to construct a malicious SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, as it can be triggered using the `/index.php/admin/Members/viewUsers/` endpoint.

**Additional details:**

- The provided exploit uses a time-based SQL injection technique.
- The vulnerable code snippets are in `cszcms/controllers/admin/Members.php` and `cszcms/models/Csz_admin_model.php`.
- The provided HTTP request example demonstrates the injection point and crafted payload.
- The attacker uses the `'or(sleep(5))#` payload (URL encoded as `%27%6f%72%28%73%6c%65%65%70%28%35%29%29%23`) to cause a delay, which confirms the vulnerability.
- Mitigation should use parameterized SQL queries and validation.
