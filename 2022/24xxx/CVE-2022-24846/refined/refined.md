- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GeoWebCache disk quota mechanism performs unchecked JNDI lookups.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unchecked JNDI lookups leading to potential class deserialization.
  - Arbitrary code execution vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - For standalone GeoWebCache, an attacker needs access to the filesystem where the GWC configuration is hosted, or the REST API at `geowebcache/rest`.
  - For GeoServer, a user interface to perform JNDI lookups exists that can be accessed remotely through the web GUI (`geoserver/web`) and the REST configuration (`geoserver/rest`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - For standalone GeoWebCache, attacker needs filesystem access or access to the REST API.
  - For GeoServer, admin-level access is required to the GeoServer GUI and REST configuration.
