# Unchecked JNDI lookups in GeoWebCache

Critical

[aaime](/aaime)
published
GHSA-4v22-v8jp-438r
Apr 14, 2022

## Package

maven

GeoWebCache
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< 1.21.0, < 1.20.2, < 1.19.3

## Patched versions

1.21.0, 1.20.2, 1.19.3

## Description

### Impact

The GeoWebCache disk quota mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code execution.

While in GeoWebCache the JNDI strings are provided via local configuration file, in GeoServer a user interface is provided to perform the same, that can be accessed remotely, and requires admin-level login to be used.

### Patches

The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoWebCache 1.21.0, 1.20.2, 1.19.3.

### Workarounds

For stand-alone GeoWebCache, the attacker must not be able to access the file system where the GWC configuration is hosted, as well as not allowing access to the REST API at `geowebcache/rest`.

For GeoServer instead, protection can be achieved by making the GUI (`geoserver/web`) and the REST configuration (`geoserver/rest`) unreachable from remote hosts, in addition to protecting access to the file system where the GeoServer configuration is stored and closing the embedded GeoWebCache REST API at `geoserver/gwc/rest`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
