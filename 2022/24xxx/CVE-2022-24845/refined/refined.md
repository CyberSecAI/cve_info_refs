{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The return value of external contract calls was not being properly validated to ensure it falls within the bounds of the declared type, specifically in complex expressions. This was due to either incorrect type inference or a code path that bypassed runtime checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate input validation of external call return data.",
      "Lack of consistent enforcement of data type constraints, especially in complex expressions."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious contract could return out-of-bounds values that, due to missing validation, would result in unexpected behavior or program crash in the calling contract. For example, an external contract could return a value for an `int128` type that exceeds its bounds, potentially causing overflows or underflows when used in the calling contract.  Additionally, a buffer overflow can occur when returning dynamic byte arrays from a contract defined in a JSON ABI.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious contract, when called by a vulnerable contract, can return carefully crafted out-of-bounds data. This data is then used within the vulnerable contract without proper validation and can cause unexpected results.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to deploy a malicious contract that will be called by a vulnerable Vyper contract, as well as knowledge of the specific vulnerable code patterns in the Vyper contract."
  },
  "affected_versions": "<0.3.2",
  "patched_versions": "0.3.2",
  "more_info": "The fix involved ensuring that returndata is decoded strictly into a newly allocated buffer at the time of the call when validation is needed. This prevents unvalidated data from entering the runtime. The commit also addressed issues with interfaces imported from JSON, where the length of Bytes return types was being incorrectly handled and could result in buffer overruns. The vulnerability was present in how the Vyper compiler handled external calls and their return values, specifically in complex expression contexts, where the clamping of data was not being performed correctly or consistently, especially when interacting with contracts defined through a JSON ABI."
