    "description": "The Hospital Management System v4.0 is suffering from Multiple SQL-Injections via three parameters in function.php, contact.php, and func3.php applications. The attacker can be receiving the all information from the system by using this vulnerability, and also the malicious actor can use sensitive information from the customers of this system.",
    "root_cause": "Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist in the Hospital Management System v4.0 due to insufficient input sanitization.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can retrieve all information from the system, potentially including sensitive customer data. This could also be leveraged to modify or delete data. The described vulnerability can be highly critical if present in external domains, subdomains, or internal networks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerabilities are triggered through HTTP POST requests to the applicationâ€™s vulnerable files"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send crafted HTTP POST requests to the application with the vulnerable parameters."
    ,
    "details": "The SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in the `function.php`, `contact.php`, and `func3.php` files.  Specific vulnerable parameters include `txtName`, `email`, and `username3`. The attacks can be performed using various techniques such as time-based blind injection, error-based injection, and UNION query injection. Payloads are provided demonstrating time-based blind injection in the txtName parameter, error-based and UNION query injection in the email parameter during login, and error-based and UNION query injection in the username3 parameter during doctor login."
