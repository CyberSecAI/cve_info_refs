This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

SECURITY: Category group permissions leaked to normal users.

```
After this commit, category group permissions can only be seen by users
that are allowed to manage a category. In the past, we inadvertently
included a category's group permissions settings in `CategoriesController#show`
and `CategoriesController#find_by_slug` endpoints for normal users when
those settings are only a concern to users that can manage a category.

# Names of groups with restricted visibility may be leaked when viewing a category

Moderate

[nattsw](/nattsw)
published
GHSA-v4c9-6m9g-37ff
Apr 7, 2022

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.8.2; beta <= 2.9.0.beta3; tests-passed <= 2.9.0.beta3

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.8.3; beta >= 2.9.0.beta4; tests-passed >= 2.9.0.beta4

## Description

### Impact

When a group with restricted visibility has been used to set the permissions of a category, the name of the group is leaked to any user that is able to see the category.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse

### Workarounds

To workaround the problem, a site administrator can remove groups with restricted visibility from any category's permissions setting.

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
