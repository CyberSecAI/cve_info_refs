# Manipulated inline images can cause Infinite Loop

Moderate

[MartinThoma](/MartinThoma)
published
GHSA-xcjx-m2pj-8g79
Apr 17, 2022

## Package

pip

PyPDF2
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<=1.27.4

## Patched versions

1.27.5

## Description

### Impact

An attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 user wrote the following code:

```
from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter
from PyPDF2.pdf import ContentStream

reader = PdfFileReader("malicious.pdf", strict=False)
for page in reader.pages:
    ContentStream(page.getContents(), reader)
```
### Patches

[`PyPDF2==1.27.5`](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2) and later are patched.

Credits to [Sebastian Krause](https://github.com/sekrause) for finding ([issue](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/issues/329)) and fixing ([PR](https://github.com/py-pdf/PyPDF2/pull/740)) it.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @sekrause **[sekrause](/sekrause)** commented [Apr 12, 2022](#issue-1202153769)

Recreated pull-request of the accidentally closed PR [#331](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/331).

It fixes [#329](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/329) by raising an exception when the stream ends and we haven't the end token for the inline image.

It also fixes [#330](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/issues/330) by using a more efficient parsing algorithm. For large inline images this change speeds up this method by many orders of magnitude:

* Instead of only reading single bytes from the stream it reads larger chunks of 8 kB and uses Python's really fast `find()` method to check for the `E` the token. Only when the token is found it falls back to the normal algorithm that detects the end of the inline image.
* Instead of using an immutable `data` it uses `BytesIO` to collect the output which support much faster appends.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3451-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Markus Koschany
June 09, 2023                                 <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : pypdf2
Version        : 1.26.0-2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24859
Debian Bug     : 1009879

Sebastian Krause discovered that manipulated inline images can force PyPDF2,
a pure Python PDF library, into an infinite loop, if a maliciously crafted PDF
file is processed.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.26.0-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pypdf2 packages.

For the detailed security status of pypdf2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pypdf2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

### **[sekrause](/sekrause)** commented [Feb 17, 2017](#issue-208420591)

| When you try to get the content stream of [this attached PDF](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/files/783085/malicious.pdf), PyPDF2 will end up in an infinite loop. So this is probably a security issue because it might be possible to denial-of-service applications using PyPDF2.  The reason is that the last while-loop in [ContentStream.\_readInlineImage](https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/blob/2a9d76d1244444f7bdd1e8f42eaeee159eadf7fa/PyPDF2/pdf.py#L2772-L2818) only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. So it's as simple as adding a (broken) inline image that doesn't have an `EI` token at all, like the attached PDF.  You can see the infinite loop by running this test script with the attached PDF:  ``` import sys  from PyPDF2 import PdfFileReader, PdfFileWriter from PyPDF2.pdf import ContentStream  with open(sys.argv[1], 'rb') as f:     pdf = PdfFileReader(f, strict=False)     for page in pdf.pages:         contentstream = ContentStream(page.getContents(), pdf)         for operands, command in contentstream.operations:             if command == b'INLINE IMAGE':                 data = operands['data']                 print(len(data)) ```  I will soon prepare a pull request that fixes this issue. |

Package        : pypdf2
Version        : 1.26.0-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24859
Debian Bug     : 1009879

Sebastian Krause discovered that manipulated inline images can force
PyPDF2, a pure Python PDF library, into an infinite loop, if a maliciously
crafted PDF file is processed.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
1.26.0-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your pypdf2 packages.

For the detailed security status of pypdf2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/pypdf2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
