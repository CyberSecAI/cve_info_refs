        "details": {
          "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper handling of equivalent intents with different keys. An attacker can submit a new equivalent intent with the same priority but different key, overwriting the flow rules of a normal intent. Subsequently, deleting the attacker's intent removes all related flow rules, effectively disrupting the normal application's connectivity despite the intent remaining in the system.",
