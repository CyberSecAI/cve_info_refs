Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$id` parameter in the `/admin/news/sort_ok.php` file before it is used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code directly incorporates the unsanitized `$id` parameter into SQL queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This occurs in both the `mod` (modify) and `del` (delete) actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, allowing them to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gain control over the database server.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Cause disruptions to the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/admin/news/sort_ok.php` endpoint, manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged into the admin panel to access the vulnerable page.
*   **Web Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be capable of crafting HTTP requests (e.g., using tools like Burp Suite) to inject malicious SQL statements in the `id` parameter.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippets are within the `if ($act=='mod')` and `if ($act=='del')` blocks in `/admin/news/sort_ok.php`.
*   The provided example requests demonstrate how to trigger the SQL injection:
    *   `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_ok.php?act=del&id=1'`
    *   `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_ok.php?act=del&id=1 and 1=1`
    *   `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_ok.php?act=del&id=1 and 1=2`
    *   `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_ok.php?act=del&id=1 RLIKE SLEEP(2)`
