Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of GIF files within Sante DICOM Viewer Pro. Specifically, the software fails to properly validate user-supplied data when processing GIF files.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during GIF file parsing. This allows the software to read past the end of an allocated buffer.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information. The advisory also notes that this vulnerability could be combined with others to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious GIF file or visiting a malicious web page containing a specially crafted GIF.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious GIF file or trick the user into visiting a malicious web page hosting the crafted file. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (i.e., the target must open the file or visit the page). The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.

The advisory indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in DICOM Viewer Pro version 11.9.2.
