Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24764:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `pjmedia_sdp_print()` and `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` functions within the PJSIP library. These functions are used to print Session Description Protocol (SDP) data into a buffer.

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow:** The functions copy data into a fixed-size stack buffer without properly validating the size of the data, leading to a potential buffer overflow. Specifically, the loop that iterates through the media format descriptions (`m->desc.fmt`) could write past the end of the provided output buffer `buf`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploitation of the overflow could potentially allow an attacker to overwrite parts of the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution. This is especially critical since it could be exploited remotely.
*   **Denial of service:** Overflowing the buffer could crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SDP manipulation:** An attacker could manipulate SDP data in a way that the `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()` functions process, causing an oversized output to be written into the stack buffer, thus triggering the overflow. This could be achieved through network messages or other external inputs.
*   **Direct API Calls:** Applications that directly call the vulnerable API are at risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** Attackers would need to have the ability to send or influence SDP messages to the vulnerable application, which would be the case in network communication scenarios.
*   **PJSUA2 user or direct API caller:** The vulnerable functions are used by PJSUA2, so apps using this higher-level API are affected. In addition, the exploit is triggered by directly calling  `pjmedia_sdp_print()` or `pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The issue is resolved in version `2.12.1` of `pjproject`.
*   The fix was introduced by commit `560a134` which includes bounds checking before writing the data.

This vulnerability is considered critical due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
