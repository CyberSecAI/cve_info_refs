{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows embedding iframes within the rich text editor, which can load user-uploaded HTML files. If the uploaded HTML file contains a script tag loading another user-uploaded JavaScript file, the JavaScript code can be executed, bypassing the Content Security Policy (CSP) due to the iframe origin and satisfying the CSP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79",
      "Insufficient input sanitization/validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the application, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file and a malicious JavaScript file to the application.",
       "An attacker uses the Rich Text HTML interface to insert an iframe that points to the uploaded malicious HTML file.",
        "When a user views content with the injected iframe, the malicious JavaScript is executed."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to upload files and use the rich text editor to insert iframes. An attacker with write/edit access is needed. No privileged access is needed if the targeted users have permissions to edit/create content that allows rich text.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was fixed by a change in the application's Content Security Policy, and by disabling the live embed in the WYSIWYG editor. The affected versions are < 9.6.1, and the fix was released in 9.7.0."
