### ⚠️ CORS Warning

The previous defaults were very permissive to make getting started as easy as possible, but leaving the CORS settings this open can be a security issue. The [safer default](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12022) is to have it disabled completely, and allow an explicit opt-in (ideally with exact domains, rather than the match-origin true).

To go back to the way things were before this release, set `CORS_ENABLED=true` and `CORS_ORIGIN=true`. That being said, it's highly recommended to use a domain allow-list, like `CORS_ORIGIN=https://directus.io`.

### @rijkvanzanten **[rijkvanzanten](/rijkvanzanten)** commented [Mar 7, 2022](#issue-1161892126)

Allows you to configure the content-security-policy header for the /assets endpoint separately from the regular endpoints. Sets default to zero trust.

# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in directus

High

[rijkvanzanten](/rijkvanzanten)
published
GHSA-xmjj-3c76-5w84
Apr 4, 2022

## Package

npm

directus
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 9.6.1

## Patched versions

9.7.0

## Description

### Impact

Unauthorized JavaScript can be executed by inserting an iframe into the rich text html interface that links to a file uploaded HTML file that loads another uploaded JS file in its script tag. This satisfies the regular content security policy header, which in turn allows the file to run any arbitrary JS.

### Patches

This was resolved in [#12020](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12020) which is released in 9.7.0

### Workarounds

You can disable the live embed in the WYSIWYG by adding `{ "media_live_embeds": false }` to the *Options Overrides* option of the Rich Text HTML interface.

### References

[#12020](https://github.com/directus/directus/pull/12020)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [directus/directus](https://github.com/directus/directus)
* Email us at security@directus.io

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24814

### Weaknesses

[CWE-79](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)
