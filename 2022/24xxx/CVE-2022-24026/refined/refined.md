- **Root Cause:** The `GetValue` function in TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi devices does not validate the size of the destination buffer when copying data from flash memory, leading to a buffer overflow. This occurs because the function retrieves configuration values from flash memory without considering the size of the buffer where it will store the retrieved data.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  - **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow (CWE-120). The `GetValue` function copies data into a fixed-size buffer without checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
  - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address, redirecting program execution to attacker-controlled code.
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - **Configuration Value Modification:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by modifying configuration values via the `cfm` command line utility or remotely via protobuf messages similar to those used by the TCL phone application.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to modify configuration values, either through the command-line utility `cfm` or remotely via protobuf messages, which could require network access to the device.
