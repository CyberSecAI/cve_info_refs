Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-24303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Pillow handles temporary image files when displaying images using `im.show()` and related functions, specifically on Linux and macOS.
- When the path to the temporary directory contains a space character, the removal of the temporary image file fails.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of File Paths with Spaces:** The core issue is that the code responsible for removing temporary files does not correctly handle file paths containing spaces. This leads to the execution of a command with an improperly constructed path, failing to delete the intended temporary file and potentially deleting a file at a path derived by misinterpreting the intended path.
- **Potential for Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the way the path was being interpreted when spaces were present, it could potentially remove a different, unintended file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** The most immediate impact is the unintended deletion of arbitrary files on the user's system, leading to potential data loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image Processing:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious image and tricking a user into opening/displaying it using Pillow's `im.show()` function, if the system's temporary directory path contains a space.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require elevated privileges and only needs to trick a user into using the `im.show()` function with a temporary directory path that contains a space, along with a malicous image to trigger the code execution path.
- The attacker needs to supply a malicious image that will cause the `im.show()` code path to be executed.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability has been present since PIL.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in Pillow version 9.0.1.
- Fedora has backported the fix to older versions of Pillow in their package repositories.
- The vulnerability is described as "Temp image removal"
