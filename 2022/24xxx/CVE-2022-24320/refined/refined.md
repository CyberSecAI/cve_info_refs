  "CVE-2022-24320": {
    "root_cause": "Improper Certificate Validation",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-295"
    ],
    "impact": "Man-in-the-Middle attack, allowing an attacker to observe and modify all data communicated between the client application and the server. This includes login credentials and sensor alarm data.",
    "attack_vectors": "Active traffic interception.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must be in an active traffic interception position and reverse engineer the communications protocol to decrypt and modify the data. They would also need to replace the server's public key with their own.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the client nonce is encrypted with a certificate provided by the server early in the handshake sequence. An attacker can replace the server's public key, decrypt the encrypted client nonce, re-encrypt it with the legitimate server key, and relay messages between the client and server. Mandiant was able to extract plaintext credentials using this vulnerability."
