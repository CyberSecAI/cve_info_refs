- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `NetUSB.ko` module, leading to an integer overflow before buffer allocation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is network-adjacent and requires no authentication.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable TP-Link AC1750 router.
