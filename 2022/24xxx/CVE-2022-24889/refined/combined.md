# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

Seems to work 👍

Maybe we could think about removing the checkbox now that you need to press a button to start the installation of the apps either way:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591237/149324578-a9ac37ff-c0d8-472e-b60e-04f813dcc7ff.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42591237/149324578-a9ac37ff-c0d8-472e-b60e-04f813dcc7ff.png)

Also we could think about renaming the desciption of the button from `Finish installation` to `Continue installation` as this is not the last step if you don't uncheck the `Install recommended apps` checkbox?

Sorry, something went wrong.
