The provided content includes a security bulletin from JetBrains which mentions CVE-2022-24332.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Logout failed to remove the "Remember Me" cookie.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to invalidate the "Remember Me" cookie upon logout.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user could remain logged in even after attempting to log out, potentially leading to unauthorized access or session hijacking if the cookie is intercepted.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially use the still-active "Remember Me" cookie to gain access to a TeamCity instance without proper credentials. This could occur if the attacker has physical or network access to the user's machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to have the "Remember Me" cookie, which could potentially be obtained via:
    - Access to the user's machine or browser.
    - Interception of network traffic.
    - Social engineering.
