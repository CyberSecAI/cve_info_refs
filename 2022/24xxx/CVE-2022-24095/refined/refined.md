- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates the following:
    - **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
    - **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is easily achievable.
    - **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No special privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** The user must perform some action for the attack to succeed.
    - **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability only affects the vulnerable component.
    - **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:H (Integrity: High):** There is a high impact on integrity.
    - **A:H (Availability: High):** There is a high impact on availability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to the system, and the user must perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.
