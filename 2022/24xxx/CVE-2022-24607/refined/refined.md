The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `/admin/news/news_ok.php` file of a web application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `$id` parameter, obtained from the GET request, is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Application Compromise:** The attacker may gain control of the application if the database user has sufficient privileges
- **Denial of Service:** Using specific SQL injection payloads, attackers can cause denial of service by making the database server busy.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP GET request, specifically by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the `/admin/news/news_ok.php` page. This requires authentication within the application's administrative interface, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content but is implicitly required by the statement that access is obtained "after Signing in to the background".
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- **Knowledge of SQL syntax:** Knowledge of SQL syntax is needed to construct malicious payloads.
