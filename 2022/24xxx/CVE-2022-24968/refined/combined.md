## CVE-2022-24968

Affected components:

* mellium.im/xmpp/websocket

Affected versions:

* v0.18.0
* v0.19.0
* v0.20.0
* v0.21.0

Fixed in:

v0.21.1
Assigned CVE:
[CVE-2022-24968](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24968)

If no TLS configuration is provided by the user, the `websocket` package
constructs its own TLS configuration using recommended defaults.
When looking up a WSS endpoint using the DNS TXT record method described in
[XEP-0156: Discovering Alternative XMPP Connection Methods](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0156.html) the
ServerName field was incorrectly being set to the name of the server returned by
the TXT record request, not the name of the initial server we were attempting to
connect to. This means that any attacker that can spoof a DNS record (ie. in the
absence of DNSSEC, DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-HTTPS, or similar technologies) could
redirect the user to a server of their choosing and as long as it had a valid
TLS certificate for itself the connection would succeed, resulting in a MITM
situation.

For more information see [this
email](https://mail.jabber.org/pipermail/standards/2022-February/038759.html) to
the XSF standards list.

Thanks to Travis Burtrum for the initial report.

Package **`xmpp`** provides functionality from the Extensible Messaging and
Presence Protocol.

### Specs

The following specifications are implemented by this package.
For a full list of all specs implemented in the `xmpp` module see
[`docs/xeps`](/docs/xeps).

 RFC || [RFC6120](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6120) |
| [RFC6121](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6121) |
| [RFC7590](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7590) |

### Packages

| Package | Synopsis |
| --- | --- |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/crypto](https://mellium.im/xmpp/crypto/) | Package **`crypto`** contains common cryptographic elements that are used by XMPP.  This package is for XMPP specific cryptographic primitives and elements. As a general rule of thumb, if the cryptography you want to implement would be usable by other projects that have nothing to do with XMPP it belongs in [`mellium.im/crypto`](https://mellium.im/crypto/) instead. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/bin](https://mellium.im/xmpp/bin/) | Package **`bin`** contains a simple.mechanism for requesting small snippets of binary data. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/blocklist](https://mellium.im/xmpp/blocklist/) | Package **`blocklist`** implements blocking/unblocking of JIDs. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/bookmarks](https://mellium.im/xmpp/bookmarks/) | Package **`bookmarks`** implements saving and retrieving a list of channels. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/carbons](https://mellium.im/xmpp/carbons/) | Package **`carbons`** implements carbon copying all messages to every device. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/color](https://mellium.im/xmpp/color/) | Package **`color`** consistent color hashes. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/commands](https://mellium.im/xmpp/commands/) | Package **`commands`** implements executable ad-hoc commands. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/component](https://mellium.im/xmpp/component/) | Package **`component`** is used to establish XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol connections. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/delay](https://mellium.im/xmpp/delay/) | Package **`delay`** implements delayed delivery of stanzas. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/dial](https://mellium.im/xmpp/dial/) | Package **`dial`** contains methods and types for dialing connections. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/disco](https://mellium.im/xmpp/disco/) | Package **`disco`** implements service discovery and entity capabilities. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/examples](https://mellium.im/xmpp/examples/) | The **`examples`** tree contains self-contained examples as separate modules.  They do not need to comply with most Mellium policies since they are separate modules, this means that they may have external dependencies, not have undergone the same level of code review, etc. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/file](https://mellium.im/xmpp/file/) | Package **`file`** contains shared functionality between various file transfer mechanisms. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/form](https://mellium.im/xmpp/form/) | Package **`form`** is an implementation of XEP-0004: Data Forms. |
| [mellium.im/xmpp/forward](https://mellium.im/xmpp/forward/) | Package **`forward`** implements message forwarding. |

[IBB](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0261.html) provides a mechanism for transmitting data over the signaling channel. It provides a useful fallback for other more efficient data transfer mechanisms such as [SOCKS5 Bytestreams](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0260.html) when a connection cannot be negotiated out-of-band. |
