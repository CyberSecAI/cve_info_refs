Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24760:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue in the `DatabaseController.js` file of the parse-server, which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is due to how the server processes incoming data, allowing an attacker to manipulate the prototype of objects.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution: The core weakness is the ability to pollute the JavaScript object prototype, which can lead to unexpected behavior and code execution.
- Unsanitized input:  The server didn't properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads through request data.
-  BSON code execution: The vulnerability is related to the BSON code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server.
- Full system compromise: Successful RCE can lead to full control over the affected server and potentially other systems in the network.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP requests: Attackers can send specially crafted HTTP requests to the parse-server.
- JSON payloads: Malicious payloads are embedded within JSON data sent in the request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable parse-server instance.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided content, but it can be assumed that the attacker needs to have the basic REST API key.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of parse-server <= 4.10.6
- The patch includes a new security feature that scans for sensitive keywords like `constructor`, `__proto__`, and `{_bsontype: "Code"}` in request data and rejects the request if they're found, responding with HTTP 400 and Parse Error 105 (INVALID_KEY_NAME). This is done by default but can be configured by the option `requestKeywordDenylist`.
- The vulnerability is not limited to MongoDB, as the prototype pollution issue is within `DatabaseController.js`, therefore affecting Postgres and potentially any other database backend.
- A workaround is provided, which involves patching the MongoDB Node.js driver and disabling BSON code execution by modifying the `BSON.prototype.deserialize` and `BSON.prototype.deserializeStream` methods.
- The vulnerability has been confirmed on both Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows.
- The fix introduces the `requestKeywordDenylist` option to customize keywords that should be blocked from the request data.
- The fix is available in parse-server version >= 4.10.7.
