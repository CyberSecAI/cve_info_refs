- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`tableName` parameter) used in a raw SQL query within the `GetColumn` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (CWE-564). The `tableName` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query string without proper escaping or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the PostgreSQL database. This could allow them to read sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain control over the database server. The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection using `PG_SLEEP()`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `GET /autoCode/getColumn` endpoint by manipulating the `tableName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated (have a valid JWT) and have network access to the vulnerable endpoint. They also need knowledge of the database system being PostgreSQL.
