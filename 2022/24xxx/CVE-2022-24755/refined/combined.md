Fixes CVE-2022-24755

Previously, when a user logged in via PAM, Bareos did only check for
authentication (i.e. the \"auth\" section in PAM). No authorization checks
were made (the \"account\" section in PAM). This patch now adds the proper
check.
This will break existing PAM configuration!

Previously, when a user logged in via PAM, Bareos did only check for
authentication (i.e. the \"auth\" section in PAM). No authorization checks
were made (the \"account\" section in PAM). This patch now adds the proper
check.
This will break existing PAM configuration!

# Bareos Director does not check authorization when authenticating via PAM

High

[arogge](/arogge)
published
GHSA-4979-8ffj-4q26
Mar 15, 2022

## Package

Bareos Director
(C++)

## Affected versions

< 21.1.0, < 20.0.6, < 19.2.12, 18.2

## Patched versions

21.1.0, 20.0.6, 19.2.12

## Description

### Impact

When Bareos Director >= 18.2 is build and configured for PAM authentication, it will skip authorization checks completely. Expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords can still login.

This problem will affect users that have PAM enabled. Currently there is no authorization (e.g. check for expired or disabled accounts), but only plain authentication (i.e. check if username and password match).

### Patches

Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 implement the authorization check that was previously missing. All users using a PAM Console in Bareos Director should immediately upgrade to one of these versions and check that their PAM configuration works as desired.

Please note that the fix may break currently working PAM configuration! See the [updated documentation](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/PAM.html#configuration) on how to fix this.

### Workarounds

The only workaround is to make sure that authentication fails if the user is not authorized. This may or may not be possible in your scenario.

### References

* [PAM Configuration in the Bareos Documentation](https://docs.bareos.org/TasksAndConcepts/PAM.html#configuration)
* [Report at huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/bounties/480121f2-bc3c-427e-986e-5acffb1606c5/)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Good work!

* bareos-check-sources found some small changes, maybe they can be merged into the changing commits,
