  "CVE-2022-24755": {
    "description": "The Bareos Director, when configured for PAM authentication, skips authorization checks. This allows expired accounts and accounts with expired passwords to log in. It only checks for authentication (username and password match) and not for authorization (e.g., checking for expired or disabled accounts).",
