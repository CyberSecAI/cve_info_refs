# Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in File Upload Facility

Critical

[jens-maus](/jens-maus)
published
GHSA-g7vv-7rmf-mff7
Mar 30, 2022

## Package

RaspberryMatic
(GitHub)

## Affected versions

≤ 3.61.7.20220226

## Patched versions

3.63.8.20220330

## Description

A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the file upload facility of the WebUI interface of RaspberryMatic exists. Due to missing input validation/sanitization and the use of dangerous CGI functionality, the file upload mechanism allows remote unauthenticated attackers with network-wise access to the WebUI interface to achieve arbitrary operating system command execution via shell metacharacters in the HTTP query string.

#### Impact

The vulnerability can be exploited via a simple HTTP request. Injected commands are executed as root, thus leading to a full compromise of the underlying system and all its components. Versions starting from `2.31.25.20180428` until `3.61.7.20220226` are affected.

#### Patches

Users should update to RaspberryMatic version `3.63.8.20220330` or newer which integrates a fix for the aforementioned security issue.

#### Workarounds

There are currently no known workarounds to mitigate the security impact and users are advised to update to the latest version available.

#### Technical details

The file upload CGI script, designed as helper code for uploading firmware updates, is exposed via the WebUI interface of RaspberryMatic on port 80/443 (lighttpd) by default. The script fails to perform adequate input filtering on user-supplied data that is passed to a dangerous function which can be used to execute arbitrary shell code within the general root user context of the WebUI.

The security issue was fixed with commit [3485465](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/commit/34854659a63e9fb3ad529bb413e96978c6450a53).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
