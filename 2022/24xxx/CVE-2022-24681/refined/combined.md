# From Atlanta to the World: How Raxis Became a Penetration Testing Leader

![](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/RaxisChristmas24-12-edited-768x1024.jpg)

## **The Raxis Story**

Back in 2011, Mark Puckett, a cybersecurity guru from Atlanta, had a lightbulb moment—why were so many companies claiming to do penetration testing but doing it so wrong? Frustrated by the stale, predictable methods dominating the industry, Mark decided it was time to shake things up. Armed with a vision and a passion for hacking (the ethical kind), he assembled an elite squad of security pros who shared his belief that pentesting should be smarter, sharper, and way more effective.

While others were busy chasing yesterday’s breaches, Mark and his team were laser-focused on predicting tomorrow’s threats. They didn’t just want to play catch-up; they wanted to outsmart cybercriminals at their own game. By staying ahead of the curve and constantly evolving their techniques, Raxis quickly became known for delivering pentesting that wasn’t just thorough—it was game-changing. The result? A reputation as industry leaders and a client list that spans the globe.

Today, Raxis is a fully remote team of brilliant minds spread across the U.S., all working together to keep businesses safe from cyber threats. And guess what? We love what we do! Whether we’re diving into complex systems or brainstorming over virtual coffee chats, we bring passion, creativity, and a little bit of fun to everything we touch. Want to meet the people behind the hacks?

Check out our [Meet The Team](https://raxis.com/category/meet-the-team/) blog or swing by our [Leadership Team](https://raxis.com/company/leadership-team/) page—we promise they’re as smart as they are cool!

# Atlanta Roots, National Footprint, Global Reach

Raxis proudly calls Atlanta home, but our team’s impact extends far beyond Georgia’s borders. As a fully remote organization, we’ve assembled a talented team of ethical hackers and cybersecurity professionals spread across the United States, enabling us to serve clients globally while maintaining a tight-knit, collaborative culture.

### We foster a collaborative culture that values teamwork, open communication, and mutual support over individual ego.

### **Work Hard, Laugh Harder**

But it’s not all serious business! We know how to have fun while getting the job done. Whether we’re sharing the latest hacking techniques on our Slack channels, catching up over Zoom calls, or joking around during virtual team-building activities, laughter is a vital part of our day. Our work-from-home model doesn’t just give us flexibility; it also allows us to bond over shared interests and experiences, making every day at Raxis feel like a new adventure.

### **Excitement Drives Exceptional Results**

We genuinely enjoy what we do, and that passion translates into exceptional results for our clients. When our team members are excited about their work, they become even more dedicated to finding innovative solutions and delivering top-notch penetration testing services. So, if you’re looking for a place where expertise meets enjoyment, and teamwork reigns supreme, Raxis is the perfect fit!

# CVE-2022-24681: ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

[Exploits](https://raxis.com/blog/category/exploits/)

Posted on

May 17, 2022

[Raxis Administrator](https://raxis.com/blog/author/raxis-sys-admin/)

Raxis lead penetration tester Matt Dunn continues his prolific discovery of new cross-site scripting CVEs. This one affects ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

[![CVE-2022-24681: ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6FE55F91-E0D0-4CAF-89FE-DD6FC3B9BB0E-1.jpeg)](https://raxis.com/blog/cve-2022-24681/)

I’m Matt Dunn, a lead penetration tester here at Raxis. Recently, I discovered a stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Zoho’s ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus.

###### **Summary**

The vulnerability exists in the /accounts/authVerify page, which is used for the forgot password, change password, and unlock account functionalities.

###### **Proof of Concept**

The vulnerability can be triggered by inserting html content, specifically tags that support JavaScript, into the first or last name of an Active Directory user. The following was inserted as a proof of concept to reflect the user’s cookie in an alert box:

```
<img src=x onerror=”alert(document.cookie)”/>
```

An example of this in the Last Name field of one such user is shown here:

![Stored XSS Payload](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure1b-1.png)

The next time that user forgets, attempts to change, or is locked out of their account and they load the authVerify page, their name is presented without being sanitized. The unescaped HTML as loaded can be seen in Figure 2:

![Unescaped JavaScript Tags](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure2-2-1.png)

After the user attempts to reset their password, the malicious content is executed, as shown in Figure 3:

![JavaScript Execution to Display User's Cookie in an Alert Box](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure3-1-1-1024x484.png)

If the user must change their password on login, the malicious content is executed, as shown in Figure 4:

![Payload Execution on Change Password Page](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure4-1-1024x454.png)

If the user attempts to unlock their account, the malicious content is executed, as shown in Figure 5:

![Payload Execution on Account Unlock](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure5-1-1.png)
###### **Affected Versions**

Raxis discovered this vulnerability on Manage Engine AD SelfService Plus 6.1 Build 6119.

# CVE-2022-24681: ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

[Exploits](https://raxis.com/blog/category/exploits/)

Posted on

May 17, 2022

By

[Raxis Administrator](https://raxis.com/blog/author/raxis-sys-admin/)

Raxis lead penetration tester Matt Dunn continues his prolific discovery of new cross-site scripting CVEs. This one affects ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

[![CVE-2022-24681: ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/6FE55F91-E0D0-4CAF-89FE-DD6FC3B9BB0E-1.jpeg)](https://raxis.com/blog/cve-2022-24681/)

I’m Matt Dunn, a lead penetration tester here at Raxis. Recently, I discovered a stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in Zoho’s ManageEngine AD SelfService Plus.

###### **Summary**

The vulnerability exists in the /accounts/authVerify page, which is used for the forgot password, change password, and unlock account functionalities.

###### **Proof of Concept**

The vulnerability can be triggered by inserting html content, specifically tags that support JavaScript, into the first or last name of an Active Directory user. The following was inserted as a proof of concept to reflect the user’s cookie in an alert box:

```
<img src=x onerror=”alert(document.cookie)”/>
```

An example of this in the Last Name field of one such user is shown here:

![Stored XSS Payload](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure1b-1.png)

The next time that user forgets, attempts to change, or is locked out of their account and they load the authVerify page, their name is presented without being sanitized. The unescaped HTML as loaded can be seen in Figure 2:

![Unescaped JavaScript Tags](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure2-2-1.png)

After the user attempts to reset their password, the malicious content is executed, as shown in Figure 3:

![JavaScript Execution to Display User's Cookie in an Alert Box](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure3-1-1-1024x484.png)

If the user must change their password on login, the malicious content is executed, as shown in Figure 4:

![Payload Execution on Change Password Page](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure4-1-1024x454.png)

If the user attempts to unlock their account, the malicious content is executed, as shown in Figure 5:

![Payload Execution on Account Unlock](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Figure5-1-1.png)
###### **Affected Versions**

Raxis discovered this vulnerability on Manage Engine AD SelfService Plus 6.1 Build 6119.

##### what is Penetration Testing?

# **A Deliberate Cyberattack to Revel Weaknesses in Security Defenses**

A penetration test, or pentest, simulates a real-world cyberattack to evaluate your security by pitting skilled ethical hackers against your defenses.

At Raxis, our penetration testers successfully breach systems in approximately 85% of tests, providing a detailed, step-by-step remediation guide for every finding. Once you’ve addressed the vulnerabilities, we conduct a retest to ensure all issues have been resolved and your security is stronger than ever.

*Example attack using a Dirty Pipe exploit (CVE-2022-0847) to escalate privileges on a Linux system.*

## Don’T Fear the Penetration Test

We won’t break anything, and Raxis’ Tim Semchenko explains why in this video.

## [PENETRATION TESTING](https://raxis.com/strike/) IS A SIMULATED, REALISTIC CYBER ATTACK USING THE SAME TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES AS A REAL HACKER

### **RAXIS PENETRATION TESTING MENTIONS DATA EXFILTRATION.  WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT?**

Data exfiltration is the act of stealing critical data from an organization, usually due to a system breach. As a proof of concept, Raxis will attempt to gain access to a small portion of restricted data, capture it via a screenshot, and redact any private information before storage or transmission. This is an important step as it demonstrates value to key stakeholders and proves the urgency in following our recommended remediation steps. Rest assured that we will take every precaution to avoid data loss or exposure during the test.

### **CAN YOU DO PENETRATION TESTS REMOTELY?**

Yes, we can, thanks to a little device called [Transporter](https://raxis.com/transporter/). No need to setup a virtual machine that someone may forget about. We can access everything needed for a penetration test from our simple-to-install device. Once we’re done, you simply turn it off and ship it back with the prepaid form. If your network is 100-percent virtual private cloud (VPC), we have a remote access solution that can access your VPC as a malicious insider. Supports AWS, Microsoft Azure, Digital Ocean, Rackspace, and others.

### **WHY HAVE RAXIS PERFORM MY PENETRATION TEST?**

Raxis is an elite team with a wide range of skills and years of experience. We are security professionals, software and app developers, help-desk veterans, radio hobbyists, models, farmers, and race car drivers. What we have in common is that we are all innovators with savant-like abilities to hack or talk our way past some of the best security in the world.

### **WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO OBTAIN A QUALITY PENETRATION TEST?**

Real cybercriminals range from lone, dorm-room pranksters to teams of state-sponsored hackers. The quality of your penetration test is determined by how well it prepares you to meet and defeat any of these threats. And how well you’re prepared depends on the talent of the team coming to test you.

### **WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PENETRATION TEST AND A RED TEAM ATTACK?**

Penetration testing is a crucial process for companies looking to secure their networks and protect sensitive information. Its focus is on identifying any existing vulnerabilities in the system and testing its defenses against potential attacks. By leveraging a combination of methodologies, a much wider range of potential weak points can be identified, and proper remediation measures can be taken to improve overall security. In contrast, a red team attack involves a more aggressive approach, using any means necessary to break through a network’s defenses and gain access to critical assets. Both methods have their merits and can greatly benefit organizations seeking to enhance their security posture.

### **DO I NEED A PENETRATION TEST IF I ALREADY KNOW I HAVE PROBLEMS?**

Yes, absolutely. First, you likely don’t know all of the problems, the severity of the problems, and how to prioritize your remediation effort. Also, a lot of our customers need help obtaining appropriate budget and resources to remediate the findings, and a penetration test makes it absolutely clear what damage could potentially occur. Sometimes, we find that customers need training before testing. In cases where a test would only uncover basic, obvious faults, we recommend having our specialists come in for consultations, training, or tabletop exercises first.

Learn how Raxis approaches web application testing and how it differs from network penetration testing. Lead penetration tester Matt Dunn explains in this post.

[![What is Web Application Penetration Testing?](https://raxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/6FA9699F-250C-4907-83C5-2F9E30B574EC-1.jpeg)](https://raxis.com/blog/web-application-testing/)

**I’m Matt Dunn, a lead penetration tester at Raxis. In this series of posts, I’m going to introduce you to the Raxis method of penetration testing web applications. We’ll start with a look at what a web app test involves and how it differs from the network testing we do.**

By their very nature, web apps deserve special scrutiny because they are designed in most cases to be accessible to a broad base of users, often with different roles that convey higher levels of privilege or access. Additionally, they are often used to perform wide ranging functionality, from shopping and banking transactions, to accessing healthcare data. With that accessibility and functionality comes exposure to a wide range of threats from malicious actors who want to exfiltrate data, modify the application, or otherwise disrupt its operation.

When Raxis performs a [web application penetration test](https://raxis.com/blog/web-app-test), we typically approach it from the viewpoint of both unauthenticated and authenticated user roles. In many cases, some of the app’s functionality is going to be behind some form of authentication. We’ll go into greater detail about authenticated and non-authenticated tests in a subsequent post. For now, however, we’ll limit the discussion to tests in which we are given credentials for all user roles.

Armed with the appropriate credentials, we examine all the functionality of the app to find out what features are accessible to users and how the application is intended to work. Can users’ profiles be changed? Are users allowed to upload files? Where can the user input their own content? What is each user *supposed* to be allowed to do? These are just some of the questions we’re looking to answer in the beginning of the test.

Once we know what the app *should* do, we’ll test all these features to see if the business logic is correct. For example, an app may allow only administrators to delete uploaded files. So, we’ll attempt to circumvent that restriction and see if we can accomplish that with lower-privileged credentials.

Raxis approaches a web application test from the perspective of unauthenticated users and authenticated users in multiple roles when more than one role exists.

Next, we will try to exploit the app’s features. For instance, we’ll test the various input fields to see if we can insert malicious code. If so, the app may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) – a topic I’ve covered extensively on our [blog](https://raxis.com/blog/cross-site-scripting) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfxrwht5irDtk9f8idb5UboGLDvaTlHhY). In a similar manner, we’ll test areas where we can upload files to see if we can upload malicious content as part of an attack.

One question we get from time to time is whether web application testing is included as part of our network penetration tests. The answer is no, for two reasons: First, it’s unlikely that, within the time of a well-scoped network test, we will be able to find credentials to all roles and parts of your web app. Second, network tests are broader in scope and identify the highest risk vulnerabilities across the entire network (as time allows). Depending on other findings, we often test the accessible pages as well as the authentication features. These include logins and “forgot password” pages, to name just a couple. Our goal is to see if we can gain unauthorized access, perform [account enumeration](https://raxis.com/blog/account-enumeration), or attack the application externally. But we won’t test as a verified user unless we’re able to gain authenticated access, and even then, we will not focus on the web app in the same depth as we would in a web app test.

That’s what makes web application testing so important. And with so many companies relying on (or even built around) web apps, it makes sense to conduct these tests regularly and address the findings in order of priority. Even if you are already performing network penetration tests, I strongly recommend that you conduct specific web application tests as well.
