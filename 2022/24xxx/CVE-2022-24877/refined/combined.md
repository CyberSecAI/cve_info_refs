# Improper path handling in Kustomization files allows path traversal

Critical

GHSA-j77r-2fxf-5jrw
May 4, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/fluxcd/flux2
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v0.29.0

## Patched versions

v0.29.0

gomod

github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

< v0.24.0

v0.24.0

## Description

The kustomize-controller enables the use of Kustomize’s functionality when applying Kubernetes declarative state onto a cluster. A malicious user can use built-in features and a specially crafted `kustomization.yaml` to expose sensitive data from the controller’s pod filesystem.

In multi-tenancy deployments this can lead to privilege escalation if the controller's service account has elevated permissions.

### Impact

Within the affected versions, users with write access to a Flux source are able to use built-in features to expose sensitive data from the controller’s pod filesystem using a malicious `kustomization.yaml` file.

### Patches

This vulnerability was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.24.0 and included in flux2 v0.29.0 released on 2022-04-20. The changes introduce a new Kustomize file system implementation which ensures that all files being handled are contained within the Kustomization working directory, blocking references to any files that do not meet that requirement.

### Workarounds

* Automated tooling (e.g. conftest) could be employed as part of a user's CI/CD pipeline to ensure that their `kustomization.yaml` files conform with specific policies, blocking access to sensitive path locations.

### Credits

The Flux engineering team found and patched this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
