# Onapsis Security Advisory 2022-0004: Missing Authentication check in SAP
Focused Run (Simple Diagnostics Agent 1.0)

## Impact on Business

Because the Simple Diagnostic Agent (SDA) handles several important
configuration and critical credential information, a successful attack
could lead to the control of the SDA, and therefore affect:
  * Integrity, by modifying the configuration.
  * Availability, by stopping the service.
  * Confidentiality and Scope changing, by decrypting all stored
credentials. Then
accessing the SAP Focused Run system as well as the SAP system managed by
the
SDA.

## Advisory Information

- Public Release Date: 06/21/2022
- Security Advisory ID: ONAPSIS-2022-0004
- Researcher(s): Yvan Genuer

## Vulnerability Information

- Vendor: SAP
- Affected Components:
  - SIMPLE\_DIAGNOSTICS\_AGENT 1.0

  (Check SAP Note 3145987 for detailed information on affected releases)

- Vulnerability Class: CWE-306
- CVSS v3 score: 9.3 AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
- Risk Level: Critical
- Assigned CVE: CVE-2022-24396
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3145987

## Affected Components Description

SAP Focused Run is a spin-off from SAP Solution Manager concentrating on the
specific needs of high volume system and application monitoring, alerting
and
analytics needs.
(<https://support.sap.com/en/alm/sap-focused-run/expert-portal/>)

## Vulnerability Details

Vulnerability 1:

No authentication is required to interact with the Simple Diagnostic Agent
http
service on port 3005 by default. Therefore, unauthenticated attackers will
have
full access to either administrative or other privileged functionalities.
Leveraging
this access, they would be able to read, modify or delete sensitive
information and
configurations with sapadm OS user privileges.

Vulnerability 2:

A path traversal exists in the Simple Diagnostic Agent service listening, by
default, on localhost port 3005. A local attacker, without particular
privileges,
can abuse this flaw in order to display the content of any OS directory
which ```sapadm```
has access to. Leading to information disclosure of potentially sensitive
data.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3145987 which provide patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3145987>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.

 - 02/02/2022: SAP provides internal ID
 - 03/08/2022: SAP releases SAP Note fixing the issue.
