Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24004 and CVE-2022-24127:

**CVE-2022-24004**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Lack of input sanitization in the REDCap messenger functionality when editing the conversation title.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML. This could lead to disclosure of sensitive application and survey data, potentially by redirecting the user to a malicious website controlled by the attacker, which may ultimately lead to credential harvesting or the downloading of malware.
*   **Attack vectors:**  A malicious user can inject arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code into the messenger conversation title field. The JavaScript/HTML payload is stored within the application and is executed when other users in the conversation toggle the messenger sidebar.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered and authenticated user of the REDCap application.

**CVE-2022-24127**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Lack of input sanitization in the project title field in the project administration interface.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML. This could potentially redirect the user to a malicious website controlled by the attacker, which may ultimately lead to credential harvesting or the downloading of malware.
*  **Attack vectors:**  A malicious user can inject arbitrary JavaScript/HTML code into the project title field within the project's settings, via a POST request to `edit_project_settings.php`. The payload is stored and executes when users access the project administration page where the project title is reflected in the page's title tag.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated REDCap user with project administration permissions (ability to modify project settings).

**Additional Details from the Content**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by LRQA.
*   The affected software is Vanderbilt REDCap versions 12.0.11 and below.
*   Vanderbilt promptly released a remediated version of REDCap (12.0.13) to fix the XSS issues.
*   The content provides the affected files and parameters for each vulnerability
    *   CVE-2022-24004:
        *   Vulnerable page: `Messenger_ajax.php`
        *   Vulnerable parameter: `new_title`
    *   CVE-2022-24127:
        *   Vulnerable page: `edit_project_settings.php`
        *   Vulnerable parameter: `app_title`
*   LRQA enhanced the Proof-of-Concept by having the XSS trigger automatically on page load, scraping data and sending it to a remote server to demonstrate the impact.
*   A timeline for the discovery and remediation of both vulnerabilities is given.
