{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `$id` parameter in `/admin/link/link_mod.php` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Depending on database user permissions, this could also lead to more severe impacts such as taking over the database or underlying system.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request with a malicious `id` parameter in the URL, e.g., `http://xx.xx.com/admin/link/link_mod.php?id=1'`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They need to be logged into the backend/admin panel to access `/admin/link/link_mod.php`"
