        "source": "www.usenix.org_f28d03e6_20250114_222832.html",
        "vulnerability": "The `purge-intent` operation, although designed to remove an intent, does not properly handle topology change events after a purge request. This occurs because the `IntentManager` in ONOS immediately withdraws device management upon receiving a purge request, before the intent is actually removed. Consequently, subsequent topology changes that should trigger a recompilation of the intent are ignored because the device information has already been removed, thus disrupting connectivity.",
        "root_cause": "The `IntentManager` in ONOS prematurely withdraws device management upon a purge request, leading to an inconsistent state where the intent is no longer managed but is not fully removed.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect handling of intent lifecycle and state transitions",
           "Lack of proper synchronization between intent removal and device management",
          "Failure to re-evaluate intents based on topology changes following a purge operation"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can disrupt the connectivity of an installed `PointToPoint` intent by requesting a purge on the intent. While the intent might appear to be functioning at the time of the purge, any subsequent network topology changes (such as link failures) will not be reflected in the intent, leading to connectivity disruption.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Control plane access (e.g., through an application or REST client)"
         ],
        "attacker_capabilities": [
          "Ability to submit intent operations to the ONOS controller."
        ]
      }
    ],
    "summary": "The vulnerability is present in the intent framework of ONOS. Specifically, when a `purge-intent` operation is requested on an installed `PointToPoint` intent, the intent is prematurely removed from device management, causing subsequent topology change events to be ignored. This results in a failure to recompile and reinstall the intent, disrupting connectivity."
