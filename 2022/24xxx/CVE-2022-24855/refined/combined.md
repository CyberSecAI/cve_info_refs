# XSS vulnerability in /\_internal endpoint

Moderate

[diogormendes](/diogormendes)
published
GHSA-wjw6-wm9w-7ggr
Apr 14, 2022

## Package

Metabase OSS and Enterprise
(Metabase)

## Affected versions

<x.42.3 <x.41.6, <x.40.7

## Patched versions

0.42.4,1.42.4,0.41.7,1.41.7,0.40.8,1.40.8

## Description

### Impact

Metabase ships with an internal development endpoint `/_internal` that can allow for cross site scripting (XSS) attacks, potentially leading to phishing attempts with malicious links that could lead to account takeover.

### Mitigation

Either upgrade immediately, or block access in your firewall to `/_internal` endpoints for Metabase. We have patched versions of Metabase that remove `/_internal` from production builds.

### Patches

The following patches (or greater versions) are available:

* 0.42.4 and 1.42.4
* 0.41.7 and 1.41.7
* 0.40.8 and 1.40.8

Please upgrade immediately if mitigation cannot applied.

All releases are available on <https://github.com/metabase/metabase/releases>

### Credits
