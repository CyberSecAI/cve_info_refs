Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how Sante DICOM Viewer Pro parses DCM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files. Specifically, crafted data within a DCM file can cause the software to read beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing DCM files.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to potentially disclose sensitive information by reading memory outside of the intended buffer.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The advisory suggests that this vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This would allow an attacker to potentially take full control of the affected system.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted malicious DCM file. This could be done either by:
    *   **Social Engineering:** The user could be persuaded to open a malicious DCM file sent to them.
    *   **Malicious Website:** The user could be lured to a website that automatically downloads and opens a malicious DCM file via the vulnerable application.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs user interaction, specifically the user opening a malicious DCM file, to trigger the vulnerability.
    *  **File Creation/Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create/manipulate a DCM file in such a way that it triggers the out-of-bounds read.

* **Additional Details:** The vulnerability was fixed in DICOM Viewer Pro version 11.9.2.

This information aligns with the description of CVE-2022-24060, which is described as an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Sante DICOM Viewer Pro.
