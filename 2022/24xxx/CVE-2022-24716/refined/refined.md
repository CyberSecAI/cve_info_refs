Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-24716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a path traversal issue in how Icinga Web 2 handles requests for static library files. Specifically, the application was not properly validating the requested file path, allowing access to files outside of the intended asset directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal flaw. By manipulating the `assetPath` parameter in a request, an attacker could access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem that the web server user has permissions to read.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application lacked proper validation and sanitization of user-provided input (`assetPath`) when constructing the file path to retrieve static assets. The code only checked if the resulting path was readable and a file, not if the path was actually within the allowed directory structure.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability could be exploited by unauthenticated users, making it a more significant risk.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to read the contents of local files on the system, such as configuration files containing sensitive information.
*   **Exposure of Credentials:** A key risk is the potential to expose `icingaweb2` configuration files that contain database credentials, potentially leading to further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious HTTP requests to the `icingaweb2` web interface, manipulating the `assetPath` parameter to include directory traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside of the intended web directory.
*   **Unauthenticated Access**: An attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the path traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server running Icinga Web 2.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability. They can perform the attack by sending crafted requests to the web server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Icinga Web 2 versions from 2.9.0 up to 2.9.5.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in versions 2.9.6 and 2.10.
*   The fix included a new check that ensures the resolved path is within the allowed directory structure.
*   The advisory recommends rotating database credentials after applying the patch, indicating the potential for leaked credentials.
