Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24905:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Argo CD login screen's handling of messages when Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled. The login screen allows for the display of arbitrary messages if the user visits a specially crafted URL, which can be exploited to spoof error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Message Spoofing: The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary messages into the login screen.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The login screen doesn't properly sanitize or validate the message content passed through the URL.
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The main impact is the ability to spoof error messages on the login screen. This could be used for phishing attacks or to confuse users.
- It should be noted that according to the Argo CD team, it's not possible to inject active content like Javascript or clickable HTML links, which limits the severity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- An attacker needs to craft a special URL containing the spoofed message.
- The victim needs to be tricked into visiting this malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a specific URL with a malicious message and trick the victim into clicking the link. No specific access to the Argo CD instance is needed.
- The attacker does not need any privileges and can perform the attack over the network.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is considered low severity with a CVSS score of 3.1.
- Patched versions of Argo CD are: 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15.
- No workarounds are available, so it is advised to update to a patched version.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Naufal Septiadi.
- This information provides more detail than the official CVE description, as it explains the specifics of the message spoofing, the constraints of the attack, the affected and fixed versions, and the lack of a workaround.
