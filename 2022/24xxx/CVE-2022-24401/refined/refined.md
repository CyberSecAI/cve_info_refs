Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24401:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Air Interface Encryption (AIE) keystream generator relies on the network time, which is publicly broadcast in an unauthenticated manner.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The use of unauthenticated network time in the AIE keystream generation process
- Lack of proper authentication of the network time broadcasts

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Loss of confidentiality
- Loss of authenticity
- Allows for decryption oracle attacks

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker can intercept the publicly broadcast, unauthenticated network time.
- The attacker uses this information to conduct decryption oracle attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  Active attacker, able to intercept radio communications.
-  Attacker needs to have access to an attacker platform (e.g. instrumented base station) to conduct the attack.
