# Stored XSS vulnerability in primary group name

Low

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-rgcm-xgvj-5mqh
Feb 23, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.20.0.5646

## Patched versions

1.20.0.5646

## Description

### Impact

ttUser.class.php in Time Tracker versions prior to 1.20.0.5646 was not escaping primary group name for display. Because of that, it was possible for a logged in user to modify primary group name with elements of JavaScript. Such script could then be executed in user browser on subsequent requests on pages where primary group name was displayed.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.20.0.5646.

### Workarounds

Modify getUserPartForHeader function in ttUser.class.php to use an additional call to htmlspecialchars when printing group name.

`$user_part .= ', '.htmlspecialchars($this->group_name);`

### For more information

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/anuko/timetracker/>
* Email us at support at anuko dot com

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24708

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
