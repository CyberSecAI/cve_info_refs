Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of a CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) proxy feature in flyteconsole. This proxy, designed to facilitate communication with a FlyteAdmin service on a different domain, could be exploited by malicious actors to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SSRF Vulnerability:** The `corsProxy` implementation in `corsProxy.js` allowed attackers to make requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs through the flyteconsole server.
- **Header Passing:** The proxy passed along the headers, which, combined with the SSRF, could potentially reveal sensitive information.
- **Unnecessary CORS Proxy:** The CORS proxy was deemed unnecessary for the console, highlighting a redundant component that became a liability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access to Internal Resources:** An attacker could access the internal metadata server or other unauthenticated internal URLs, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Headers:** The proxy forwards headers, which could expose sensitive details to unauthorized targets.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** SSRF can be a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks, like data exfiltration or pivoting to other internal systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access to the flyteconsole instance. If the flyteconsole is exposed to the general internet, it is vulnerable.
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker would need to craft malicious requests with target URLs that the flyteconsole server would then make on their behalf.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the flyteconsole instance.
- **Understanding of the Application:** Knowledge about the proxy endpoint and how to craft malicious requests would be needed to effectively exploit the SSRF.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by removing the `cors_proxy` in version v0.52.0.
- **Yanked Versions:** All prior versions of flyteconsole were retracted and deleted to emphasize the severity of the issue.
- **Workaround:** Disabling the flyteconsole's internet accessibility was provided as a temporary workaround.
- **Severity:** The advisory classified the vulnerability as "Critical".
