|  |  | ## CORS Proxying: Recommended Setup |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In the common hosting arrangement, all API requests will be to the same origin |
|  |  | serving the client application, making CORS unnecessary. However, if you would like |
|  |  | to setup your local dev enviornment to target a FlyteAdmin service running on a different |
|  |  | domain you will need to configure your enviornment to support CORS. One example would be |
|  |  | hosting the Admin API on a different domain than the console. Another example is |
|  |  | when fetching execution data from external storage such as S3. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | The fastest (recommended) way to setup a CORS solution is to do so within the browser. |
|  |  | If you would like to handle this at the Node level you will need to disable authentication |
|  |  | (see below). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | \_NOTE:\_ Do not configure for both browser and Node solutions. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | These instructions require using Google Chrome. You will also need to identify the |
|  |  | URL of your target FlyteAdmin API instance. These instructions will use |
|  |  | `https://different.admin.service.com` as an example. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | 1. Set `ADMIN\_API\_URL` and `ADMIN\_API\_USE\_SSL` |
