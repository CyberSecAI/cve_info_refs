Subject: CVE-2022-24294: ReDoS in Apache MXNet RTC Module

Severity: low

Description:

A regular expression used in Apache MXNet (incubating) is vulnerable
to a potential denial-of-service by excessive resource consumption.
The bug could be exploited when loading a model in Apache MXNet that
has a specially crafted operator name that would cause the regular
expression evaluation to use excessive resources to attempt a match.
This issue affects Apache MXNet versions prior to 1.9.1.

Mitigation:

Users that depend on MXNet 1.x are advised to upgrade to MXNet>=1.9.1,<2

Credit:

Apache MXNet would like to thank Dwi Siswanto for reporting this issue.
