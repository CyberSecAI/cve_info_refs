# UNION SQL injection and time-based blind in Puncher plugin

Moderate

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-wqx7-95fx-wjxj
Feb 23, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.20.0.5642

## Patched versions

1.20.0.5642

## Description

### Impact

UNION SQL injection and time-based blind injection vulnerabilities existed in Time Tracker Puncher plugin in versions prior to 1.20.0.5642. This was happening because the Puncher plugin was reusing code from other places and was relying on not checked date parameter in POST requests. Because the parameter was not checked, it was possible to craft POST requests with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database.

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.20.0.5642 with a better fix in 1.20.0.5643 when the Puncher plugin was re-coded.

### Workarounds

An upgrade is highly recommended. If upgrade is not practical, introduce a check for the date parameter in the access checks portion of the puncher.php as in version 1.20.0.5642. Note that this check is no longer needed if you use an updated Puncher plugin as in version 1.20.0.5643.
