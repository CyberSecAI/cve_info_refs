Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24707:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Time Tracker Puncher plugin reusing code from other parts of the application.
*   The plugin was not properly validating the `date` parameter in POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **UNION SQL injection:** Attackers could inject malicious SQL code into the `date` parameter of POST requests due to the lack of input validation.
*   **Time-based blind SQL injection:** Attackers could potentially infer data by exploiting time delays caused by injected SQL queries, although this is less explicit than the UNION SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers could potentially manipulate the Time Tracker database.
*   This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted POST requests to the Time Tracker Puncher plugin.
*   The malicious SQL code is injected within the `date` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers need the ability to send POST requests to the Time Tracker application, specifically targeting the vulnerable Puncher plugin.
*   They do not necessarily need to be authenticated users of the system, as the vulnerability is present in a part of the plugin handling external requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.20.0.5642 with a more comprehensive fix in 1.20.0.5643.
*   A temporary workaround was to introduce a check for the `date` parameter in the `access checks` portion of the `puncher.php` file, which was implemented in version 1.20.0.5642.
* The fix is visible in the diff of puncher.php, where a check for date parameter is introduced `if ($date && !ttValidDbDateFormatDate($date))`.
* The affected versions are `< 1.20.0.5642`
