Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Smokescreen processes URLs when applying its deny list feature. Specifically, the deny list could be bypassed by:
1. Appending a dot (`.`) to the end of a user-supplied URL.
2. Providing the URL in a different letter case.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application did not properly normalize or sanitize URLs before checking them against the deny list. This allowed for simple bypass techniques like appending a dot or altering the case of the URL.
- **SSRF Prevention Bypass**: The primary security mechanism of the smokescreen proxy is to prevent Server Side Request Forgery. This flaw bypasses the intended protection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker could bypass the deny list, potentially gaining the ability to make requests to internal or otherwise restricted resources.
- **Confidentiality breach:** By making unintended requests to internal resources an attacker can get access to restricted information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network. An attacker can send crafted requests to the Smokescreen proxy.
- **Malformed URLs:** The attack vector involves crafting a URL with a dot appended or using a different letter case to bypass the deny list.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send requests to the Smokescreen proxy.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the bypass technique to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected versions:** Versions of Smokescreen prior to 0.0.3 are affected.
- **Patched versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.0.3 and later.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.8 (Moderate), with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N
- **Reported by:** Grzegorz Niedziela is credited for reporting the vulnerability.
- **CWE:** No CWE was explicitly assigned to this vulnerability in the provided information.
