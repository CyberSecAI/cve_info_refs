# Smokescreen [Test](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/actions?query=workflow%3ATest+branch%3Amaster) [Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/github/stripe/smokescreen?branch=master)

Smokescreen is a HTTP CONNECT proxy. It proxies most traffic from Stripe to the
external world (e.g., webhooks).

Smokescreen restricts which URLs it connects to:

* It uses a pre-configured hostname ACL to only allow requests addressed to certain allow-listed hostnames,
  to ensure that no malicious code is attempting to make requests to unexpected services.
* It also resolves each domain name that is requested, and ensures that it is a publicly routable
  IP address and not an internal IP address. This prevents a class of attacks where, for instance,
  our own webhooks infrastructure is used to scan Stripe’s internal network. Smokescreen
  can also be further configured to allow or deny specific IP addresses or ranges.

Smokescreen also allows us to centralize egress from Stripe, allowing us to give
financial partners stable egress IP addresses and abstracting away the details
of which Stripe service is making the request.

In typical usage, clients contact Smokescreen over mTLS. Upon receiving a
connection, Smokescreen authenticates the client's certificate against a
configurable set of CAs and CRLs, extracts the client's identity, and checks
the client's requested CONNECT destination against a configurable per-client
ACL.

By default, Smokescreen will identify clients by the "common name" in the TLS
certificate they present, if any. The client identification function can also
be easily replaced; more on this in the usage section.

## Dependencies

Smokescreen uses [go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) to manage dependencies. The
linked page contains documentation, but some useful commands are reproduced
below:

* **Adding a dependency**: `go build` `go test` `go mod tidy` will automatically fetch the latest version of any new dependencies. Running `go mod vendor` will vendor the dependency.
* **Updating a dependency**: `go get dep@v1.1.1` or `go get dep@commit-hash` will bring in specific versions of a dependency. The updated dependency should be vendored using `go mod vendor`.

Smokescreen uses a [custom fork](https://github.com/stripe/goproxy) of goproxy to allow us to support context passing and setting granular timeouts on proxy connections.

Generally, Smokescreen will only support the two most recent Go versions. See
[the test configuration](/stripe/smokescreen/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml) for details.

## Usage

                                                 This should be an absolute path with all symlinks, if any, resolved.
   --stats-socket-file-mode FILE_MODE          Set the filemode to FILE_MODE on the statistics socket (default: "700")
   --version, -v                               print the version

```

### Client Identification

In order to override how Smokescreen identifies its clients, you must:

* Create a new go project
* Import Smokescreen
* Create a Smokescreen configuration using cmd.NewConfiguration
* Replace `smokescreen.Config.RoleFromRequest` with your own `func(request *http.Request) (string, error)`
* Call smokescreen.StartWithConfig
* Build your new project and use the resulting executable through its CLI

Here is a fictional example that would split a client certificate's `OrganizationalUnit` on commas and use the first particle as the service name.

```
package main

import (...)

func main() {
	// Here is an opportunity to pass your logger
	conf, err := cmd.NewConfiguration(nil, nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	if conf == nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	conf.RoleFromRequest = func(request *http.Request) (string, error) {
		fail := func(err error) (string, error) { return "", err }

		subject := request.TLS.PeerCertificates[0].Subject
		if len(subject.OrganizationalUnit) == 0 {
			fail(fmt.Errorf("warn: Provided cert has no 'OrganizationalUnit'. Can't extract service role."))
		}
		return strings.SplitN(subject.OrganizationalUnit[0], ".", 2)[0], nil
	}

	smokescreen.StartWithConfig(conf, nil)
}
```

### IP Filtering

To control the routing of requests to specific IP addresses or IP blocks, use the `deny-address`, `allow-address`, `deny-range`, and `allow-range` options in the config.

### Hostname ACLs

A hostname ACL can be described in a YAML formatted file. The ACL, at its top-level, contains a list of services as well as a default behavior.

Three policies are supported:

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Open | Allows all traffic for this service |
| Report | Allows all traffic for this service and warns if client accesses a remote host which is not in the list |
| Enforce | Only allows traffic to remote hosts provided in the list. Will warn and deny if remote host is not in the list |

> ⚠️ **The ACL is only applied to hostnames *as they appear in the request*!** If you want to allow or deny traffic based on the destination IP address *after DNS resolution*, you should be using the config options instead (see the `IP Filtering` section above).

A host can be specified with or without a globbing prefix. The host (without the globbing prefix) must be in Punycode to prevent ambiguity.

| host | valid |
| --- | --- |
| `example.com` | yes |
| `*.example.com` | yes |
| `api.*.example.com` | no |
| `*example.com` | no |
| `ex*ample.com` | no |
| `éxämple.com` | no |
| `example.*` | hell no |

[Here](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/blob/master/pkg/smokescreen/acl/v1/testdata/sample_config.yaml) is a sample ACL.

#### Global Hostname Allow/Deny Lists

Optionally, you may specify a global allow list and a global deny list for hostnames in your ACL config.

These lists override the policy, but do not override the `allowed_domains` list for each role.

For example, specifying `example.com` in your global\_allow\_list will allow traffic for that domain on that role, even if that role is set to `enforce` and does not specify `example.com` in its allowed domains.

Similarly, specifying `malicious.com` in your global\_deny\_list will deny traffic for that domain on a role, even if that role is set to `report` or `open`.
However, if the host specifies `malicious.com` in its `allowed_domains`, traffic to `malicious.com` will be allowed on that role, regardless of policy.

> ⚠️ **The global\_deny\_list will only block specific *hostnames*, not entire *destinations*.** For example, if `malicious.com` is in the global\_deny\_list but the IP address that it resolves to is not, roles with an `open` policy will still be able to access the destination by using its IP address directly. For this reason, **we recommend using allowlists instead of denylists** whenever it is possible to do so, and **blocking IP addresses via config options, not the ACL** (see the `IP Filtering` section above).

If a domain matches both the `global_allow_list` and the `global_deny_list`, the `global_deny_list` behavior takes priority.

[Here](https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/blob/master/pkg/smokescreen/acl/v1/testdata/sample_config_with_global.yaml) is a sample ACL specifying these options.

# Smokescreen SSRF via deny list bypass

Moderate

[cds2-stripe](/cds2-stripe)
published
GHSA-gcj7-j438-hjj2
Apr 7, 2022

## Package

gomod

smokescreen
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.0.3

## Patched versions

0.0.3

## Description

The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal infrastructure.

Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature by appending a dot to the end of user-supplied URLs, or by providing input in a different letter case.

### Recommendation

Upgrade Smokescreen to version 0.0.3 or later.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
