{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Deserialization of untrusted data in the Hessian component of Apache Cayenne when running on older Java versions.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsafe deserialization of Hessian data which can be exploited to transmit malicious payloads.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution on the server by exploiting vulnerable third-party dependencies via malicious payloads.",
  "Attack vectors": "Client access to Cayenne Remote Object Persistence (ROP) can be used to transmit malicious payloads via Hessian deserialization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs client access to the Cayenne ROP service. The server needs to be running Apache Cayenne 4.1 or earlier, and use an older, vulnerable version of Java."
