# auth.pam allows accounts with expired passwords and expired accounts

Moderate

[foxcpp](/foxcpp)
published
GHSA-6cp7-g972-w9m9
Mar 6, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/foxcpp/maddy
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<0.5.4

## Patched versions

0.5.4

## Description

### Impact

Any configuration on any maddy version <0.5.4 using auth.pam is affected.

No password expiry or account expiry checking is done when authenticating using PAM.

### Patches

Patch is available as part of the 0.5.4 release.

### Workarounds

If /etc/shadow authentication is used, it is possible to replace auth.pam with auth.shadow which is not affected.

It is possible to blacklist expired accounts via existing filtering mechanisms (e.g. auth\_map to invalid accounts in storage.imapsql).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
