Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `auth.pam` module in Maddy Mail Server not properly checking for account or password expiry when authenticating users via PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules). The `pam_acct_mgmt` function, which is responsible for this check, was being called, but the return status was not handled correctly which lead to the expiry check being skipped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Failure to enforce password expiry policies.
- Failure to enforce account expiry policies.
- Inadequate error handling when calling the pam\_acct\_mgmt function which skips account expiry check if the return value is not PAM\_SUCCESS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to accounts with expired passwords or accounts that should be disabled, if the PAM configuration allows expired accounts.
- This allows access to services relying on the auth.pam module and therefore any resources accessible through these services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks are possible since the mail server typically accepts connections from the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to know valid usernames that are expired and be able to attempt authentication to the service utilizing the vulnerable `auth.pam` implementation.
- No special privileges or user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved properly checking the return status of `pam_acct_mgmt`.
- Workarounds are possible, such as using `auth.shadow` or blacklisting expired accounts through other mechanisms.
- The vulnerability affects all Maddy versions prior to 0.5.4.
- CVSS v3 base metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating a moderate severity.
