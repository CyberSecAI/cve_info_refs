  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2022-24614",
    "description": "When reading a specially crafted JPEG file, metadata-extractor up to 2.16.0 can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that finally leads to an out-of-memory error even for very small inputs. This could be used to mount a denial of service attack against services that use metadata-extractor library.",
    "related_to_security": true,
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when extending the index, preventing guard statements from catching indices outside the expected buffer range.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-770",
      "Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to excessive memory allocation leading to out-of-memory errors.",
    "attack_vector": "Network (processing of a malicious JPEG file).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JPEG file to a system that uses the vulnerable library.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted JPEG file, causing the application to allocate large amounts of memory and ultimately crash. The fix involves addressing the integer overflow issues and adding input validation."
