    "related": true,
    "summary": "NekoHTML library is vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption when parsing ill-formed HTML markup, leading to a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception.",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists in the fork of `org.cyberneko.html` used by Nokogiri (Rubygem). It occurs when the parser encounters ill-formed processing instructions (PIs) in HTML, causing it to consume excessive resources, ultimately resulting in an `OutOfMemoryError`. This vulnerability is specific to the Nokogiri fork of NekoHTML and other forks may have similar issues.",
    "affected_versions": "< 1.9.22.noko2",
    "fixed_versions": "1.9.22.noko2",
    "root_cause": "Improper parsing of ill-formed processing instructions leading to uncontrolled memory consumption.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-400"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive resource consumption causing the application to crash with an OutOfMemoryError.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network based attack. Exploitable by sending crafted HTML markup with ill-formed processing instructions to the vulnerable parser.",
     "required_capabilities": "No special privileges or user interaction required. An attacker can remotely exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTML to a service that utilizes the affected library."
