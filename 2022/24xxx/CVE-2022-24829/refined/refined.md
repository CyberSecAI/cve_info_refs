Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of authentication on the `/api` endpoint of the local server used by the Garden dashboard. This server, by default, listens on `0.0.0.0`, making it accessible from any network interface. This allows unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The `/api` endpoint exposed all environment variables and configurations necessary for building the application and its cloud environment. This leaked sensitive information.
*   **Missing Authentication:**  The server did not require any authentication for access to the `/api` endpoint in affected versions.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The server listening on `0.0.0.0` made it accessible to anyone on the same network, and potentially to the internet if the user had a public IP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** Attackers on the same network could obtain sensitive information such as credentials, secrets, and other environment variables.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** The stolen secrets could be used to gain unauthorized access to other systems or cloud environments.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker on the same local network as a user running Garden in dev or watch mode can access the vulnerable endpoint.
*  **Public Internet Exposure:** If the user is on a public IP address, the server can be potentially accessed from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the victim, or able to reach the victim's public IP address if exposed to the internet.
*   No special privileges are required on the victim's machine, other than the ability to make network requests.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Garden versions prior to `0.12.39`.
*   The fix in `0.12.39` introduces authentication using a key for the `/api` endpoint.
*   A temporary workaround involves using a firewall to block access to port 9777 from anywhere other than localhost.
*   The provided code diffs show the implementation of the auth key and the related checks on the server side.
