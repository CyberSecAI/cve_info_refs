# Malicious Javascript injection via a POST request to /presale/join

Low

[franckc](/franckc)
published
GHSA-v6fc-qwxx-m4h7
Apr 19, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<c12d2f2

## Patched versions

c12d2f2

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability allows for malicious users to inject malicious Javascript via a POST request to `/presale/join`. User-controlled data is passed with no sanitization to SendGrid and injected into an email that is delivered to the founders@originprotocol.com email. If the email recipient is using an email program that is susceptible to XSS, then that email recipient will receive an email that may contain malicious XSS. Regardless if the email recipient’s mail program has vulnerabilities or not, the hacker can at the very least inject malicious HTML that modifies the body content of the email.

### Patches

Patched in [#617](https://github.com/OriginProtocol/origin-website/pull/617).

### Workarounds

None.

### References

This vulnerability was found using [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) (a [query contribution](https://github.com/github/codeql/pull/7127) by [@mrthankyou](https://github.com/mrthankyou) and [@jorgectf](https://github.com/jorgectf)).

### For more information

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24864

### Weaknesses

### @mrthankyou **[mrthankyou](/mrthankyou)** commented [Nov 14, 2021](#issue-1052970596)

This PR introduces a new query that searches for reflected XSS email injections. This query specifically looks for vulnerabilities that utilize any one of these major Python email libraries:

* [Django's Core Mail Library](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/email/)
* [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/)
* [FlaskMail](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Mail/)
* [SmtpLib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html)

The most common scenario this query looks for is a Python application that utilizes an email library to deliver emails. The Python application passes user input into an email's HTML body, which can result in a reflective XSS attack on the email recipient.

PS: Please note that both [@mrthankyou](https://github.com/mrthankyou) and [@jorgectf](https://github.com/jorgectf) wrote this query. If accepted as a bug bounty we would like a 100% of the reward to go to [@jorgectf](https://github.com/jorgectf). This will be re-iterated in the bug bounty submission.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Thank you for the changes, I think this is now acceptable to merge into experimental. However, you might want to hold off and retain your ability to address a potential high FP rate, in case you move forward with your bounty submission?

You currently only have the string comparison sanitizer. Is that how people would normally protect themselves?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This is an interesting question about sanitizers.  I did some research and only found one sanitizer that looks to be popular called [Bleach](https://github.com/mozilla/bleach). I don't think this is something the CodeQL library accounts for at this time. It has some popularity with 2k stars and it has [163k dependent repositories](https://github.com/mozilla/bleach/network/dependents).  Bleach is pretty simple to use:  ``` import bleach  bleach.clean('evil text') // this sanitizes text bleach.linkify('evil text with a link: github.com') // this also sanitizes text ```  It might be worth it add this sanitizer. Idk. It looks to be a pretty simple step we can add in the query but at the same time I think Bleach also has a lot of weird ways to sanitize text which can impact how long this will take (see [here](https://bleach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linkify.html#using-bleach-linkifier-linker)). Also, this seems like something that should be baked into the CodeQL library and could deserve it's own PR. |

As discussed offline, we believe adding Bleach would require an additional PR given its complexity. We will work on that in the future in case this query arises many repos using Bleach for this :) |

| The `HtmlEscaping` is a good addition to the sanitizers. That concept can be made more powerful by adding a model of `Bleach`, but I agree that this can be done separately. |

| [@yoff](https://github.com/yoff),  The merge conflict was resolved by overriding our branch's private import of `RemoteFlowSources` and making it public. If this should in fact be private let me know and I can make the change. Considering main has the import set to public I opted to use main's branch.  Also, sorry I missed the mention of expected test output. I haven't looked at the expected test output. I'll take a look and see how to fix it. Sorry for alerting you to review this PR when it's actually not ready :(. |
