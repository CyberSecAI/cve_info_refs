{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "User-controlled data from a POST request to `/presale/join` is passed without sanitization to SendGrid and injected into an email.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Improper Neutralization of Input During Generation of Output ('Cross-site Scripting')"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious user can inject arbitrary JavaScript code or HTML into emails sent to founders@originprotocol.com. If the email client is vulnerable to XSS, the injected JavaScript will execute. Regardless of XSS vulnerability in the email client, the attacker can modify the email body with malicious HTML.",
  "Attack vectors": "A POST request to `/presale/join` with malicious user-controlled data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can make POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
