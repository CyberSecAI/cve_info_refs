- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly writes plugin-related configuration information to `conf.php` without any security filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can write arbitrary files, potentially leading to server compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the plugin description field in the HYBBS management interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the HYBBS management interface to create/modify plugins.
