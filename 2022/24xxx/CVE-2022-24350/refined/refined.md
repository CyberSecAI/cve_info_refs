The provided content relates to CVE-2022-24350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the IHISI (Insyde H2O Host Interface System Interface) SMM handler, specifically within the handling of command buffers. The IHISI function 0x17 does not properly check if the output data will go beyond the end of the command buffer when using the GetFlashTable function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The lack of proper bounds checking allows for an out-of-bounds write, potentially corrupting memory located after the command buffer.
- Improper buffer size validation: The `GetFlashTable` function is called before the size of the output buffer is validated, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data corruption: The vulnerability could lead to the destruction of data located immediately following the command buffer.
- System instability: Tampering with memory could potentially lead to system instability or other unexpected behavior.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could send a specially crafted IHISI command with a size parameter that is not properly validated.
- This could allow writing beyond the intended buffer and tampering with adjacent data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send IHISI commands to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker requires high privileges to send the malformed IHISI commands to trigger the vulnerability in SMM.
