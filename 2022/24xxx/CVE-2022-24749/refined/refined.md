Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of SVG files during content upload within the Sylius e-commerce platform. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize SVG files, allowing for the inclusion of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS. By uploading a malicious SVG file, an attacker can inject client-side scripts that execute when the file is viewed in a browser.
- **Inadequate Sanitization:** The application lacks proper sanitization of SVG file contents before storing them, allowing for the execution of injected scripts.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows the upload of SVG files without proper content validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **XSS Attacks:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser sessions of users who view the maliciously crafted SVG file. This could lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Data theft
  - Defacement of the website
  - Phishing attacks
- **Affected Areas**: Both admin panel and shop pages are vulnerable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file through the admin panel.
- **File Viewing:** The malicious SVG file is then viewed by either an administrator through the admin panel or by a customer on the shop front, which triggers the malicious script execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs access to the admin panel to upload files.
- **Malicious SVG Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create or acquire a malicious SVG file with embedded XSS payload.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content also includes a workaround that involves using the `enshrined/svg-sanitize` library and overwriting the `sylius.image_uploader` service. This is used as a patch that can be applied if the user is unable to update to a patched version.

- The vulnerability affects Sylius versions before 1.9.10, between 1.10 and 1.10.11, and between 1.11 and 1.11.2.
- The patched versions are 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Low."
