The provided content is related to CVE-2022-24009.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `GetValue` function in multiple binaries of the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi system does not properly check the size of the destination buffer when copying data from flash configuration. This can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Classic buffer overflow (CWE-120): The `GetValue` function retrieves data from flash and copies it into a buffer without validating the buffer's capacity.
- Lack of input sanitization: The `GetValue` function copies data from flash without validating or sanitizing the size of the data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By overflowing a stack buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address, gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Configuration modification: Attackers can modify configuration values stored in flash to trigger the vulnerability using the `cfm` command line utility or remotely through protobuf messages (similar to those used by the TCL phone app).
- Network access: The device is managed via a phone application, which communicates with the device over a network. This implies that the device is susceptible to remote exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to modify flash configuration: Either via local access to the device, or remotely using the command line utility or protobuf messages.
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the device over a network.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in multiple binaries of the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi system due to the heavy reliance on the vulnerable `GetValue` function for retrieving configuration values.
- The report specifically mentions that `confsrv` has 359 calls to `GetValue`.
- The report also states that while MITRE would consider this to be 1874 unique CVEs, they decided to issue one CVE per binary containing a call to `GetValue` for brevity.
- The specific example shows that overwriting the `sys.app.lang` value can cause a stack buffer overflow when the value is retrieved by `set_extdns_by_lang`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a `lang` value longer than 0x11c bytes, overflowing the stack and allowing for arbitrary code execution.
