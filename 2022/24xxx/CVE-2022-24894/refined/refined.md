Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-24894:

**Root Cause:**
- The Symfony HTTP cache system, when enabled, acts as a reverse proxy, caching HTTP responses including headers.
- A change in `AbstractSessionListener` caused responses to potentially contain a `Set-Cookie` header.
- The HTTP cache system could store this `Set-Cookie` header and return it to other clients.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure caching of sensitive headers:** The HTTP cache was not configured to filter out sensitive headers like `Set-Cookie`, leading to their unintended storage and reuse.
- **Exposure of session cookies:**  The `Set-Cookie` header, which often contains session identifiers, was being cached and potentially sent to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session hijacking:** An attacker could retrieve a victim's session by receiving the cached `Set-Cookie` header, allowing them to impersonate the victim.
- **Information disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of session information to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Cache poisoning:**  By inducing a server to cache a response containing the Set-Cookie header, and having the cache serve it to another user.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** A MITM attacker could potentially intercept and reuse cached headers if the cache is not protected from external access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to receive a cached response which includes the victim's Set-Cookie header
- The application must have the Symfony HTTP cache system enabled

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was mitigated by modifying the `HttpStore` constructor to accept a list of private headers which are to be removed from the cached responses.
- The default value for this list of private headers is `Set-Cookie`.
