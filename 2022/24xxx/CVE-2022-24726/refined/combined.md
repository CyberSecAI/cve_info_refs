## Description

![@rsc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/104030?u=7776f9d68ea1bc349af0227c03fca30350a05477&v=4&size=48)[rsc](https://github.com/rsc)opened [on Feb 9, 2022](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/51112#issue-1128977907)

On 64-bit system, a large enough regexp can be deeply nested enough to cause goroutine stack overflows (the kind where the runtime says no more stack for you and exits). Specifically, strings.Repeat("(", 1<<20)+strings.Repeat(")", 1<<20) is enough.

I ran a test inside Google using C++ RE2 limiting the nesting depth of accepted expressions. A max depth of 200 did not break any of our tests. (A max depth of 100 did break one library that was mechanically generating a truly awful regular expression.)

To fix the problem I intend to cap the maximum depth of a regexp accepted by syntax.Parse at 1000, >5X what is needed by Google C++ and really about 100X what is reasonable.

Depth means the depth of the parse tree: `(((((a)))))` has depth 5, as does `a*****` in POSIX mode. (In Perl mode that's a syntax error.)

This will need to be backported to Go 1.16 and Go 1.17 as well.

# Unauthenticated control plane denial of service attack due to stack exhaustion

High

[howardjohn](/howardjohn)
published
GHSA-8w5h-qr4r-2h6g
Mar 10, 2022

## Package

docker

Istio
([Docker](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Adocker))

## Affected versions

<1.13.2

## Patched versions

1.11.8,1.12.5.1.13.2

## Description

### Impact

The Istio control plane, istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any authentication from the attacker.

For simple installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments, especially [external istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet.

### Patches

* Istio 1.13.2 and above
* Istio 1.12.5 and above
* Istio 1.11.8 and above

### Workarounds

Disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the public internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a set of known, trusted entities.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
