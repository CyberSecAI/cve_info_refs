Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24726:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a stack overflow vulnerability in the `regexp` package of the Go programming language. Deeply nested regular expressions can cause the goroutine stack to overflow, leading to process exit (crash). Specifically, a large number of nested parentheses like `((((((...)))))` triggers the issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unbounded Recursion in Regular Expression Parsing:** The `syntax.Parse` function in the Go regexp package does not limit the nesting depth of regular expressions.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafted input (deeply nested regular expressions) without proper checks.
- **Stack Overflow:** Deeply nested regexp parsing results in uncontrolled recursion which causes stack exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted, deeply nested regular expression, an attacker can cause the application to crash due to a stack overflow.
- **Control Plane Crash:** In the context of Istio, if the Kubernetes validating or mutating webhook service (which processes the malicious regexp) is exposed publicly, it can lead to the crash of the istiod control plane.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious request containing a crafted regular expression over the network.
- **Publicly Exposed Endpoint:** The Istio control plane's webhook service, which listens on port 15017, is vulnerable if exposed publicly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable service.
- **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to send the malicious request to the vulnerable endpoint. This means an unauthenticated user can trigger the issue if the port is exposed.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Input:** The attacker needs to be able to generate or have access to a regular expression with sufficient depth to trigger the stack overflow.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Go versions prior to the fix.
- The fix involves capping the maximum depth of a regular expression accepted by `syntax.Parse` to 1000, which is well above a reasonable depth but prevents stack exhaustion.
- The issue was found while testing with the C++ RE2 library, which did not break with a max depth of 200.
- Istio versions prior to 1.13.2, 1.12.5, and 1.11.8 were vulnerable, with a fix implemented in those versions and above.
- The fix in Istio also includes a limit on the size of the request body, further mitigating potential denial-of-service issues and reading untrusted data. This also adds a `HTTPConfigReader` method to limit the size of data read.

The commit `6ca5055a4db6695ef5504eabdfde3799f2ea91fd` from istio/istio addresses this vulnerability by:
  - Replacing calls to `io.ReadAll` with `kube.HTTPConfigReader` in `pkg/kube/inject/webhook.go` and `pkg/webhooks/validation/server/server.go`
  - Adding `HTTPConfigReader` to `pkg/kube/util.go`, which limits the size of read data

In summary, CVE-2022-24726 is a DoS vulnerability caused by a stack overflow due to unbounded recursion during the parsing of deeply nested regular expressions.
