### API changes

#### Added

#### Changes

#### Deprecated

* Usage of the `DBmysql::query()` method is deprecated, for security reasons, as it is most of the time used in an insecure way.
  To execute DB queries, either `DBmysql::request()` can be used to craft query using the GLPI query builder,
  either `DBmysql::doQuery()` can be used for safe queries to execute DB query using a self-crafted SQL string.
  This deprecation will not trigger any error, unless the `GLPI_STRICT_DEPRECATED` constant is set to `true`, to avoid
  cluttering error logs.
