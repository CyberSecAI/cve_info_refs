Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-24781:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that the application allowed users to change their own UUID (user ID) to that of another user by sending a specific command via the browser console. This indicates a lack of proper session management and insufficient validation of user IDs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Session Handling:** The application was vulnerable to session hijacking by allowing users to claim the session of another user. This was possible because the UUID, used for session identification, could be manipulated by the client.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application did not properly validate or sanitize the user-provided data used to identify sessions. This lack of validation allowed attackers to inject arbitrary user IDs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking/Takeover:** A malicious user could take over another player's session, effectively impersonating them within the game. This would allow the attacker to perform actions as the victim, potentially disrupting gameplay or gaining an unfair advantage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Manipulation via Browser Console:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly manipulating the client-side application via the browser's developer console, sending crafted requests with the target user's UUID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the game and browser console:** The attacker must be a legitimate user of the application and have the ability to access and manipulate the browser's developer console.
*   **Knowledge of target's UUID:** The attacker needs to know the UUID of the user they wish to impersonate. This could be achieved through various means like observing network traffic, social engineering, or possibly other vulnerabilities in the application.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was identified and fixed in version 1.1.0 of the application.
*   The advisory recommends that all users of the affected version (<=1.0.0) immediately upgrade to the patched version.
*   The commit message `Corrigido saida de usuarios crash do backend se o client manda algo qâ€¦` within the provided context further confirms that the commit `005456d` addresses a related issue where the backend crashes if the client sends non-string data, in addition to implementing user session tracking. This indicates that the patch likely enforces stricter type checking or input sanitization on data received from the client.

**CWE:**

The provided information does not include a specific CWE. However, the vulnerability is related to insecure session handling and input validation which could fall under multiple CWEs such as CWE-384 (Session Fixation), CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key), CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), among others.
