{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Client-side file extension checks and insufficient server-side file handling.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Client-side validation bypass: File extension checks are performed on the client-side, which can be easily bypassed by intercepting and modifying the POST request.",
      "Inadequate server-side handling: Server-side, the system appends a `.bak` extension to certain file types, but if `.bak` files are not blacklisted from being executed, this does not prevent code execution. Furthermore, not all executable file types have .bak appended (e.g., .phtml)."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote unauthenticated attackers can upload executable files and achieve remote code execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker fills out a form with file upload capability, intercepts the POST request, modifies the uploaded file to be a malicious executable, submits the request, and captures the response to get the path of the uploaded file, which can then be accessed via a browser to trigger execution.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with a vulnerable form, intercept POST requests, and modify file uploads."
