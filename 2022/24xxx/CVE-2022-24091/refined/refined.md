- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A write operation occurs outside the intended buffer boundary.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a malicious file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted file.
