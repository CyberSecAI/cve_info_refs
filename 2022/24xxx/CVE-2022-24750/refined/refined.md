{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The DSMPlugin module in UltraVNC allows loading of plugins from arbitrary locations due to insecure usage of LoadLibrary.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure loading of dynamic libraries (DLLs) via LoadLibrary.",
    "Local Privilege Escalation (LPE)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local authenticated user can achieve local privilege escalation (LPE) on a vulnerable system.",
  "Attack vectors": "By leveraging the insecure LoadLibrary function in the DSMPlugin module to load a malicious DLL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local authenticated user with the ability to manipulate the plugin path used by UltraVNC."
