- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing file name extensions before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a network-adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on affected TP-Link TL-WR940N routers.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can send a specially crafted request to the affected device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected router, and no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
