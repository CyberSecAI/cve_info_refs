  "CVE-2022-24070": {
    "description": "Subversion's mod_dav_svn is prone to a use-after-free vulnerability when looking up path-based authorization rules, which can result in denial of service (crash of HTTPD worker handling the request).",
    "root_cause": "The `post_config` hook in `mod_dav_svn` is called multiple times during module initialization. The first call is for validation purposes where the memory pools are cleared afterwards. However, the module's implementation always treats the first call as the 'real' initialization call and caches pointers that become invalid after the pools are cleared.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation results in denial of service by crashing the HTTPD worker handling the request. Depending on the Apache HTTPD server configuration, it may terminate the entire HTTPD server process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a request to the server which requires a lookup of path-based authorization (authz) rules"
    ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "No special capabilities are required, simply send a malicious request to the server."
