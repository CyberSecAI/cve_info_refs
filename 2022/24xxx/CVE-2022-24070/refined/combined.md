| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=65861#c0)  Daniel Shahaf    2022-01-29 09:56:22 UTC  ``` I've been able to find little information on the post_config hook in the project's documentation (doxygen, website, etc.).  I did find <<https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HTTPD/ModuleLife>>, but I don't know whether that page is up-to-date, considering that it hasn't been edited at least since it was imported from moin.  The following patch fleshes out the API documentation a bit.  Issues:  1. Does not explain what post_config hooks are expected to do / not do in a pre-config invocation.  Is that assumed knowledge?  Is there an explanation of this elsewhere that can be pointed to?  2. A period may need to be added after the words "for each module".  I haven't run doxygen(1) on the file to check this.  3. The documentation of ap_state_query()-related macros includes some non-doxygen'd comments (/*…*/ rather than /**…*/), so API users will need to review the raw .h file to get all information.

Subversion's mod\_dav\_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption
Summary:
========
While looking up path-based authorization rules, mod\_dav\_svn servers
may attempt to use memory which has already been freed.
Known vulnerable:
=================
Subversion mod\_dav\_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive).
Servers that do not use mod\_dav\_svn are not affected.
Known fixed:
============
Subversion httpd servers 1.14.2.
Subversion httpd servers 1.10.8.
Details:
========
Server modules for Apache HTTP server (httpd), such as mod\_dav\_svn,
implement several hooks that httpd calls at various times.
One of these, post\_config, may be called more than once during module
initialization. The number of calls and the purpose of each call
depend on whether the module is loaded at httpd startup or during a
later reload of httpd's configuration.
When httpd loads a module at startup, it performs a configuration
check at which time it calls the module's post\_config hook for
validation purposes. Later, httpd calls the hook again; this is the
"real" initialization call.
In contrast, when httpd loads a module at a later stage, due to
reloading its own configuration, it calls the post\_config hook only
once.
In vulnerable versions of Subversion, the post\_config hook
implementation does not take these semantics into account. As a
result, it always treats the first call as the "real" call and
performs initialization, including caching of pointers which are used
later. When the call is in fact for validation only, those pointers
subsequently become invalid when the memory allocation pools into
which they point are cleared.
Subsequent operations on the freed (and possibly reused) memory may
lead to a segfault crash.
The affected pointers are used by Subversion when serving requests
which require a lookup of path-based authorization (authz) rules.
However, even servers which do not make use of authz should be upgraded.
The invalid pointers are always present in the running program and could
be abused via other unknown attack vectors.
Severity:
=========
CVSSv3.1 Base Score: 7.5 (High)
CVSSv3.1 Base Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
Exploitation results in denial of service by crashing the HTTPD worker
handling the request. The impact of this differs depending on how the
Apache HTTPD server is configured, including the choice of MPM (Multi-
Processing-Module). If the worker shares its memory address space with
the main thread, as is the case with e.g. the Event MPM, the entire
HTTPD server process will terminate. If the pre-fork MPM is used, the
worker will terminate but the HTTPD server will stay up, and service
availability will depend on how frequently the attacker is able to
send malicious requests which target the vulnerability.
Recommendations:
================
We recommend all users to upgrade to a known fixed release of the
Subversion server.
Users who are unable to upgrade may apply the patch included below.

* Created by  [ASF Infrabot](/confluence/display/~infrabot) on [May 22, 2019](/confluence/pages/viewpreviousversions.action?pageId=115522384 "Show changes")

HTTPd start-up phase:

* First execution "configuration check"
  + The module is dynamically loaded in the single-process single-thread server, that is still running as root if it was started as root.
  + The configuration is parsed, but just to check that it is valid (sanity check).
  + The module post\_init hook is called for the 1st time in the sanity check.
  + Depending on platform, the module is then completely unloaded. It means that global and static variables are reset. This also means any cleanups left pointing into the module against the process pool will go boom on exit.
* Second execution "live"
  + The module is loaded again if necessary.
  + The configuration is parsed again, for real this time.
  + The module post\_init hook is called for the 2nd time.
  + Children processes are started. They may be forked (Unix) or spawned (Windows).
  + The pre\_init/post\_init hooks are never called in the forked (Unix) child process, see the child\_init hook instead.
  + If the children are spawned (as on Windows), they repeat the whole startup, and the post\_config hook is called exactly twice again in the children (and never a third time on graceful restart).

HTTPd restart:

* On graceful restart, the module is unloaded and reloaded/init, and the post\_config hook is called (still in the parent process) once, not twice.
* On Windows, a new spawned child process is created by the parent upon a graceful restart.
* During a graceful restart, new children processes may be running on the new configuration while old children on the old configuration are still serving out their requests.

## 1st and next post\_config hook calls

A common hack to execute the post\_config hook body only once is to set a flag on 1st execution and exit. On 2nd execution, the flag is retrieved and module initialization is performed. This hack uses the apr\_pool\_userdata\_set and apr\_pool\_userdata\_get functions to saves the flag in memory managed by the process pool.

* Example from <http://www.codemass.com/mod_shm_counter/>
* See also <http://www.clove.org/~aaron/presentations/apachecon2002/>

```
static int shm_counter_post_config(apr_pool_t *pconf, apr_pool_t *plog,
                                   apr_pool_t *ptemp, server_rec *s)
{
    apr_status_t rv;
    shm_counter_scfg_t *scfg;
    void *data = NULL;
    const char *userdata_key = "shm_counter_post_config";

    /* Apache loads DSO modules twice. We want to wait until the second
     * load before setting up our global mutex and shared memory segment.
     * To avoid the first call to the post_config hook, we set some
     * dummy userdata in a pool that lives longer than the first DSO
     * load, and only run if that data is set on subsequent calls to
     * this hook. */
    apr_pool_userdata_get(&data, userdata_key, s->process->pool);
    if (data == NULL) {
        /* WARNING: This must *not* be apr_pool_userdata_setn(). The
         * reason for this is because the static symbol section of the
         * DSO may not be at the same address offset when it is reloaded.
         * Since setn() does not make a copy and only compares addresses,
         * the get() will be unable to find the original userdata. */
        apr_pool_userdata_set((const void *)1, userdata_key,
                              apr_pool_cleanup_null, s->process->pool);
        return OK; /* This would be the first time through */
    }

    /* If we made it this far, we can safely initialize the module */
```

A problem with this hack exists when a module is installed while the server is running, and the server is just restarted to load the module. In this case, the post\_config hook is executed once after restart and will only set the flag. Module initialization will not be performed, and when child\_init and other hooks are called, bad things may happen.

### post\_config hook call by children processes

On WinNT MPM, the post\_config hook is also called by the children processes.

To know if we are in a child, we can check the AP\_PARENT\_PID environment variable: it is only set in children on the WinNT MPM.

**Note:** Some module take for granted that the post\_config hook is only called in the parent process. That's wrong (on Win32). But calling apr\_global\_mutex\_create() in the parent and in the child with the same filename does not hurt, the mutex is shared.

* Example from <http://www.codemass.com/mod_shm_counter/>

```
    /* If we made it this far, we can safely initialize the module */
    scfg = ap_get_module_config(s->module_config, &shm_counter_module);

    ap_add_version_component(pconf, "mod_shm_counter/$Revision $");

    /* Since we are still in the parent before any children have been
     * created, it is safe to create the shared lock and shared segment.
     * If we waited until a child had been created, we run in to a race
     * condition.
     */

    rv = apr_global_mutex_create(&scfg->mutex, scfg->shmcounterlockfile,
                                 APR_LOCK_DEFAULT, pconf);

```
## Race conditions during graceful restart

During a graceful restart, old children are still serving old requests while new children are serving new requests. If the same lock must be used by old and new children, then the lock name must be the same and cannot be generated with tmpnam() or similar functions in the post\_config hook.

## Preventing module unloading

To prevent module unloading, there is a *sick and twisted hack* (wrowe dixit): "the evil method is to use apr\_dso\_load() against the process pool to load it 'permanently'".

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2022-13cc09ecf2
2022-07-15 01:35:20.762670
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : subversion
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 1.14.2
Release : 5.fc35
URL : <https://subversion.apache.org/>
Summary : A Modern Concurrent Version Control System
Description :
Subversion is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a
hierarchy of files and directories while keeping a history of all
changes. Subversion only stores the differences between versions,
instead of every complete file. Subversion is intended to be a
compelling replacement for CVS.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update includes the latest stable release of \_Apache Subversion\_, version
\*\*1.14.2\*\*. This update addresses two security issues, `CVE-2021-28544` and
`CVE-2022-24070`. For more information see
<https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2022-24070-advisory.txt> and
<https://subversion.apache.org/security/CVE-2021-28544-advisory.txt> ### Client-
side bugfixes: \* Don't show unreadable copyfrom paths in 'svn log -v' \* Fix -r
option documentation for some svnadmin subcommands \* Fix error message encoding
when system() call fails \* Fix assertion failure in conflict resolver ###
Client-side improvements and bugfixes: \* Support multiple working copy formats
(1.8-onward, 1.15) ### Server-side bugfixes: \* Fix use-after-free of object-
pools when running in httpd (issue
[SVN-4880](<https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SVN-4880>))

Version : 1.14.2
Release : 5.fc36
URL : <https://subversion.apache.org/>
Summary : A Modern Concurrent Version Control System
Description :
Subversion is a concurrent version control system which enables one
or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a
hierarchy of files and directories while keeping a history of all
changes. Subversion only stores the differences between versions,
instead of every complete file. Subversion is intended to be a
compelling replacement for CVS.

side bugfixes: \* Don't show unreadable copyfrom paths in 'svn log -v' \* Fix -r

#### Description

We are experiencing crashen when using mod\_authz\_svn with the AuthzSVNAccessFile setting.

Every time a request is to be served the respective httpd worker will segfault immediately.

(A full reproduction setup is posted in the ML thread)

I debugged this down to the following sequence:

mod\_authz\_svn registers a post\_config handler with the httpd core.

This handler will use the memory pool passed as its first argument to set up a childpool in svn\_repos\_authz\_initialize().

This childpool is then cached in a static variable (authz\_pool) and never updated again because of the caching logic inside svn\_repos\_authz\_initialize().

httpd core however calls the post\_config hook multiple times.

(httpd server/main.c line 740 and 807).

In between those calls the memory pool passed to the hook is cleared in line 750.

This means that the static variables in authz.c point to memory of a destroyed pool.

In our case this memory is reused by another pool leading to use-after-free issues like these segfaults.

[stsp](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=stsp) indicated on the ML that similar issues probably also occur in svn\_fs\_initialize() and other places.

Package        : subversion
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-28544 CVE-2022-24070

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system.

CVE-2021-28544

    Evgeny Kotkov reported that Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom'
    paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based
    authorization (authz) rules.

CVE-2022-24070

    Thomas Weissschuh reported that Subversion's mod_dav_svn is prone to
    a use-after-free vulnerability when looking up path-based
    authorization rules, which can result in denial of service (crash of
    HTTPD worker handling the request).

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.4-1+deb10u3.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.14.1-3+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.
