CVE-2022-24751: Clear sessions outside of the transaction.

```
Clearing the sessions inside the transaction makes Zulip vulnerable to
a narrow window where the deleted session has not yet been committed,
but has been removed from the memcached cache.  During this window, a
request with the session-id which has just been deleted can
successfully re-fill the memcached cache, as the in-database delete is
not yet committed, and thus not yet visible.  After the delete
transaction commits, the cache will be left with a cached session,
which allows further site access until it expires (after
SESSION_COOKIE_AGE seconds), is ejected from the cache due to memory
pressure, or the server is upgraded.

Move the session deletion outside of the transaction.

Because the testsuite runs inside of a transaction, it is impossible
to test this is CI; the testsuite uses the non-caching
`django.contrib.sessions.backends.db` backend, regardless.  The test
added in this commit thus does not fail before this commit; it is
merely a base expression that the session should be deleted somehow,
and does not exercise the assert added in the previous commit.

# Race condition in user deactivation allows continued API access

Low

[alexmv](/alexmv)
published
GHSA-6v98-m5x5-phqj
Mar 15, 2022

## Package

Zulip Server
(Application)

## Affected versions

> 4.0, < 4.11

## Patched versions

4.11

## Description

### Impact

Zulip 4.0 and later are vulnerable to a race condition during account deactivation, where a simultaneous access by the user being deactivated may, in rare cases, allow continued access by the deactivated user. This access can theoretically continue until one of the following events happens:

- The session expires from memcached; this defaults to two weeks, and is controlled by `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` in `/etc/zulip/settings.py`

- The session cache is evicted from memcached by other cached data.

- The server is upgraded, which clears the cache.

### Patches

This problem is patched in Zulip Server 4.11. Upgrading to this version will, as a side effect, deactivate any cached sessions that may have been leaked through this bug, because upgrading clears all memcached caches (at least from a logical perspective).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, you can discuss them on the [developer community Zulip server](https://zulip.com/developer-community/), or email the Zulip security team.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24751

### Weaknesses

[CWE-284](/advisories?query=cwe%3A284)
