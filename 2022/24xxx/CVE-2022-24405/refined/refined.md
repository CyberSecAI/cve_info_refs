The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-24405.

**CVE-2022-24405**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The document converter API processes serialized Java classes when using remote cache calls, allowing the injection of malicious code.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) via deserialization of untrusted Java objects.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary operating-system level commands can be executed on the instance running OX Documentconverter with the privileges of the "open-xchange" user. This could lead to modification or exfiltration of configuration files, or denial of service through excessive resource usage.
*   **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the OX Documentconverter API. The attacker injects a malicious, serialized Java class using this API, which is then executed in the context of the document converter component.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network or system access to use the OX Documentconverter API, as the API is not publicly accessible by default, but might be accessed by exploiting other vulnerabilities. The vulnerability requires authenticated access, therefore, the attacker must be a high-privileged user.
