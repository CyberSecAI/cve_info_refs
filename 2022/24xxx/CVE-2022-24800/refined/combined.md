# RCE via race condition in upload process

Moderate

[daftspunk](/daftspunk)
published
GHSA-8v7h-cpc2-r8jp
Jul 12, 2022

## Package

composer

october/system
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

1.0.475, 1.1.11, 2.2.14

## Patched versions

1.0.476, 1.1.12, 2.2.15

## Description

### Impact

This advisory affects plugins that expose the `October\Rain\Database\Attach\File::fromData` as a public interface. This vulnerability does not affect vanilla installations of October CMS since this method is not exposed or used by the system internally or externally.

When the developer allows the user to specify their own filename in the `fromData` method, an unauthenticated user can perform remote code execution (RCE) by exploiting a race condition in the temporary storage directory.

### Patches

The issue has been patched in Build 476 (v1.0.476) and v1.1.12 and v2.2.15.

### Workarounds

Apply [octobercms/library@fe569f3](https://github.com/octobercms/library/commit/fe569f3babf3f593be2b1e0a4ae0283506127a83) to your installation manually if unable to upgrade to Build 476 (v1.0.476) or v1.1.12 or v2.2.15.
