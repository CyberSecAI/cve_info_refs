- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Crafted data within a DCM file can cause a write past the end of an allocated buffer during parsing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** User must open a specially crafted malicious DCM file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to create a malicious DCM file or a malicious page hosting such file that will be opened by the victim. User interaction is required.
