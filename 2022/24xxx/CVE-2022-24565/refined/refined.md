- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The *Alias* of a site was not properly escaped when shown as a condition for notifications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious HTML code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view notification configurations. This could lead to information disclosure or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the *Alias* field of a site to inject malicious HTML code. This code is then stored and displayed in the notification configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have *Notification configuration* and *Site management* rights, which are equivalent to admin rights by default. The attacker also needs to be able to modify site aliases. The user viewing the notification must also trigger the malicious script.
