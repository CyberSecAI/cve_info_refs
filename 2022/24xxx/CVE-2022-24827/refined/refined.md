Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-24827:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of special characters within parameterized SQL queries in the `elide-datastore-aggregation` component. Specifically, the introduction of the hyphen character (`-`) as a valid character in parameterized TEXT columns, when combined with Elide's aggregation data store and parameterized columns, creates a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code through a parameterized TEXT column to bypass authorization checks.
- **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements:** The application fails to properly sanitize or neutralize special characters in user-provided input that is used within SQL queries. The `-` character is interpreted as a SQL comment, enabling attackers to manipulate the query's logic.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** Elide doesn't use prepared statements in the specific case of parameterized columns/tables in the Aggregation Data Store. This lack of defense against injection enables the SQL injection vulnerability to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Authorization Filters:** A successful attack allows the adversary to bypass server-side authorization filters by injecting SQL comments (`--`) to remove or alter the `WHERE` clause of the generated SQL query.
- **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify data, or even potentially disrupt system operations, since the injected code can be arbitrarily crafted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Parameterized TEXT Columns:** The vulnerability specifically exists when using parameterized columns of the TEXT type.
- **Analytic Queries:** It only impacts analytic queries, and not standard CRUD operations.
- **Carefully Crafted Queries:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted query containing the `-` character followed by additional SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the System:** The attacker needs knowledge of Elide's data aggregation features, parameterized columns, and how they're used.
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker requires the ability to provide input that is used to populate a TEXT type parameterized column, in order to inject the SQL comment.

**Additional Information:**
- A patch for this vulnerability is available in Elide version 6.1.4.
- Workarounds involve using different parameterized column types (other than TEXT) or avoiding the use of parameterized columns entirely.
- The vulnerability was introduced in version 6.1.2 and subsequently reverted and fixed in 6.1.4
- The vulnerability is specific to the Elide Aggregation Data Store and its handling of parameterized queries.
