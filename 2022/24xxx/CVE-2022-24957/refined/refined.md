Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient input validation and output encoding in the DHC Vision eQMS application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input when creating or editing information objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The application reflects the name of an information object without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the browser of users who view the manipulated object's version or history page. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Defacing the web page
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered when a user opens the version or history page of a manipulated object.
- The injection point is the name field of an information object when created or edited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or edit information objects in the content section of the application.
- No special network position is required.

**Technical Details:**
- An XSS payload like `![](x)` can be used to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `name` parameter in the `POST /dhcvision/com.dhc.dhcvision.ui.DHCV/SaveInformation` request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory provides a Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
- The advisory includes a recommendation to encode untrusted output context sensitively.
- The advisory provides a timeline of vulnerability discovery, reporting, and disclosure.
