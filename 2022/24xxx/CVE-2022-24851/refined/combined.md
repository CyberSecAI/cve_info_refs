# Stored XSS and arbitrary image read vulnerability

Moderate

[gruberroland](/gruberroland)
published
GHSA-f2fr-cccr-583v
Apr 15, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 7.9.1

## Patched versions

7.9.1

## Description

### Vulnerabilities

Stored XSS - The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page.

Arbitrary Image Read - The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the logoFile parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter relative paths like `../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png` via tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present).

For detailed information, see references.

### Impact

Stored XSS vulnerability and arbitrary image reads.

The risk is mitigated by the fact that, both issues require an attacker to be able to login to LAM admin interface. Usually, this already requires administrative rights.

### Patches

The issue is fixed in version 7.9.1.

### Workarounds

* Limit access to LAM admin interface to trusted users
* Manually apply changes from [3c6f09a](https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/commit/3c6f09a3579e048e224eb5a4c4e3eefaa8bccd49)

### References

[#170](https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/issues/170)

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/LDAPAccountManager/lam/issues>
* Email us on [lam-public mailinglist](https://www.ldap-account-manager.org/lamcms/mailinglists)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24851

### Weaknesses

[CWE-79](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)

Package        : ldap-account-manager
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24851 CVE-2022-31084 CVE-2022-31085 CVE-2022-31086
                 CVE-2022-31087 CVE-2022-31088

Arseniy Sharoglazov discovered multiple security issues in LDAP Account
Manager (LAM), a web frontend for managing accounts in an LDAP directory,
which could result in information disclosure or unauthenticated remote
code execution.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.0.1-0+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ldap-account-manager packages.

For the detailed security status of ldap-account-manager please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ldap-account-manager>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| Hello..  I am a security researcher, and with my friend Manthan([@netsectuna](https://github.com/netsectuna)), We reviewed the application and discovered multiple vulnerabilities.   1. Stored XSS    Description - The profile editor tool has an edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page.    Impact - Medium/High (depends on how the server profile is configured.. if ldap users and ldap admin both can login to ldap account manager, an ldap user can write save xss payloads to trigger tasks as admin)    Affected URL - http://<IP>/templates/profedit/profilepage.php    POC :    As an authenticated user navigate to the URL - http://<IP>/templates/profedit/profilemain.php    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162628997-5b877945-3db7-4fba-b424-bb86856fd512.png)    Create a new user profile for either user or group (editing profile will also work) and in description field add the XSS payload `"><script>alert(document.domain)</script><` and save the profile.    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162629114-c0a7282a-1778-4d74-ba04-b67e4cf9c175.png)    Now whenever any authenticated user will edit this profile page, XSS payload will be triggered.    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162629239-6b8e9b76-6b26-4c41-9ca0-63e055df26da.png)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162633102-6b9ac30e-23b1-40d9-b72c-e3eff89c4149.png) 2. Arbitrary jpg/png file read    Description - The pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the `logoFile` parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter relative paths like `../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png` via tools like burpsuite. Later when a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image on that path(if image is present).    Impact - Low (Impact is low, due to highly unlikelihood of ldap admin knowing the locations of images having any sensitive/Personal information. One possible attack vector is to enumerate tools/software on the system by checking for icon images.. like in this POC we can verify the server has vim installed)    Affected URL - http://<IP>/templates/pdfedit/pdfpage.php    POC :    As an authenticated user navigate to the URL - http://<IP>/templates/pdfedit/pdfmain.php    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162630572-1df0e7a2-b612-4417-a189-6c1d9b86f8a4.png)    Create a new pdf structure for either user or group (editing profile will also work)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162630659-ab031e4c-c51e-4bf1-811a-f3ab052d05e7.png)    With burpsuite proxy on, click on save. In burpsuite, replace the value of logoFile parameter to the path of image file, lets say `../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png` for the icon file of vim and forward the request.    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162630756-de36b943-c31b-44c2-9094-de78f1679637.png)    Now while exporting pdf for a user if that `POC` profile is selected, the exported pdf will have the vim logo image.    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162630996-3e966b5a-7ca2-4eda-b776-f65243132078.png)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47531747/162631017-325b3ad6-fad9-42f2-beec-b6f401c72303.png)  We would have loved to fix these ourselves.... but *cries bcz of bad dev skills*. |
