The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `$id` parameter in `/admin/manager/admin_mod.php` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL, such as `http://xx.xx.com/admin/manager/admin_mod.php?id=2'`, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
