The provided content is related to CVE-2022-24104.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a Use-After-Free error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The specific vulnerability is a Use-After-Free (UAF). This occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This would allow an attacker to run malicious code on the victim's system, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local, meaning that an attacker would need to have a file or some other type of input within the local system to trigger the vulnerability.
User interaction is required for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file/input that can be opened by the vulnerable software and cause the use-after-free condition. No special privileges are required and attacker would need user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.
