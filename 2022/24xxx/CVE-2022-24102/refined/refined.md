**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free (CWE-416) vulnerability is present, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
- No privileges are required (PR:N).
- User interaction is required (UI:R)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open a specially crafted file (e.g., a PDF file). The user interaction is required.
- The attacker would need to have the malicious file on the local file system that they then trick the user into opening, leading to the use after free.
