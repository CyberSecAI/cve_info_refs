- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User session is not invalidated when the user's password is reset through the password recovery mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly invalidate existing user sessions after a password reset, leading to potential session hijacking. This is related to CWE-613, which refers to insufficient session expiration.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a user resets their password but the old session remains active, a malicious actor who had access to the old session could potentially continue using that session as if they were the legitimate user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector would involve an attacker gaining access to an existing, valid user session, followed by the legitimate user resetting their password. The attacker can then continue using the session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have prior access to a user's session (e.g. through session hijacking or similar) before a legitimate user performs a password reset.
