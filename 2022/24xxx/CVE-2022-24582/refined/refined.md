- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `firstname` parameter in the `manage_user` application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **XSS (Stored)**: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the vulnerable `firstname` parameter and stored in the application's database. This stored script will be executed when other users access the affected data.
    - **PHPSESSID Hijacking**: The XSS vulnerability can be exploited to steal the user's `PHPSESSID` cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Session hijacking**: A malicious user can steal other user's session IDs by using XSS and use them to gain unauthorized access.
    - **Account takeover**: A threat actor can send a stolen session id to other malicious users and then can attack the system.
    - **Arbitrary code execution**: Through XSS, an attacker can inject malicious Javascript into the system which can result in arbitrary code execution within the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - A malicious user injects malicious JavaScript code into the `firstname` field of the `manage_user` app.
    - This stored XSS is triggered when other users access the application's data.
    - The malicious user exploits the XSS vulnerability to steal the `PHPSESSID` cookie.
    - Stolen session ids can be used by other malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must have access to the application to inject malicious code through the vulnerable parameter.
    - The attacker must be able to induce other users to access the application, thus triggering the stored XSS.
