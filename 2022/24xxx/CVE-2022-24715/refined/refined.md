Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24715:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Icinga Web 2 handles SSH resource files. Specifically, it allows authenticated users with configuration access to create these files in arbitrary directories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path traversal/Improper Input Handling:** The application does not properly sanitize the input related to SSH resource creation, allowing users to specify file paths outside of intended directories.
- **Arbitrary file write:** The ability to create SSH resource files at arbitrary locations enables writing arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** By writing malicious code to an accessible location, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server running Icinga Web 2.

**Attack vectors:**
- Authenticated users with access to the configuration interface can create an SSH resource with a crafted path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the Icinga Web 2 configuration interface.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is related to the `SshResourceForm.php` file.
- The fix involves generating a hash of the user name and using that for the file name, rather than directly using the user name, preventing the creation of a file in an arbitrary directory.
- The vulnerability affects Icinga Web 2 versions 2.9.5 and earlier and is resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10.
