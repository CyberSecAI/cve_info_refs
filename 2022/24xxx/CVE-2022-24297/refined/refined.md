- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper buffer restrictions in the firmware of some Intel NUCs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient checks on buffer boundaries, leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to achieve escalation of privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required for the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a privileged user account on the targeted system.
