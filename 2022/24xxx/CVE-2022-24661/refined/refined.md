- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A memory corruption vulnerability exists within the `starview+.exe` executable when parsing specially crafted `.sce` files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119) leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This can also lead to a crash, data extraction.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious `.sce` file with the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious `.sce` file with the affected application. No special privileges are required.
