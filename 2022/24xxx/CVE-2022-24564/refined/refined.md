- **Root cause of vulnerability:** HTML injection in the "Help Text" field of user attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML code that would be executed in the browser of any user viewing the affected user attribute when editing a user. The impact includes potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker injects malicious HTML code into the "Help Text" field while creating or editing a user attribute. This malicious code is then rendered when a user views the user attribute when editing any user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the "User management" and "Manage custom attributes" rights. This typically means a high privilege level is needed on the target Checkmk system. The attacker also requires the victim user to be editing any user within the Checkmk system to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
