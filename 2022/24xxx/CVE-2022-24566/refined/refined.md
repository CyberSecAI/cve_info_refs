- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper escaping of the title of a *Predefined condition* when displayed as a condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious HTML code into the title of a *Predefined condition*. This code would then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the condition, potentially allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information, perform actions on the user's behalf, or deface the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious HTML code into the title of a *Predefined condition*. The injected code is then executed when other users view the condition in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to create or modify *Predefined conditions*. The attacker also requires a low privilege access (PR:L). The user interaction is required (UI:R) for the attack to be effective since the injected code is executed when another user views the condition.
