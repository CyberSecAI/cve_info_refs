Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `inlineSVG` function of the `@finastra/ssr-pages` package. Specifically, the `iconName` parameter, which is used to construct the path to an SVG file, was not properly sanitized before being used in the `join` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `iconName` parameter. An attacker could provide a specially crafted `iconName` such as `../../../../etc/passwd` to escape the intended directory (`../assets/img/`) and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially read any file that the server process has access to. This could include sensitive files containing configuration settings, secrets, or even source code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `svg` property of the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function. This function accepts the svg property, which is passed to the vulnerable `inlineSVG` function.
- The attacker provides an untrusted `iconName` as input to the vulnerable function, which is then used to construct a file path using the `join` function without proper sanitization, leading to path traversal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide input to the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function, specifically controlling the `svg` parameter and thereby the `iconName` used by the vulnerable `inlineSVG` function.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code was located in `src/helpers/inlineSVG.helper.ts`.
- The fix implemented in commit `c3e4c563384ae3ba3892f37dd190218577620780` introduced a whitelist function (`iconNameWhitelist`) that only allows specific icon names, preventing path traversal.
- The affected versions of the package are `< 0.1.4` and the patched version is `0.1.4`.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "Moderate" severity.
