{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The code does not handle a specially crafted HTTP request URI correctly, potentially leading to a buffer overflow when decoding URL-encoded characters into the `p_conn->PathPtr` buffer. Specifically, the `HTTP_URL_DecodeStr` function might write beyond the allocated buffer if the decoded string is longer than expected.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution on the target device due to memory corruption. The attacker would be able to influence program execution by overwriting other data in memory.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request with a long or specifically encoded URI to the vulnerable HTTP server. The vulnerability is triggered during the URI parsing stage, particularly within the HTTPsReq_URI_Parse() function.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This could be over a network if the server is exposed or, potentially, through other means of communication depending on the environment."
