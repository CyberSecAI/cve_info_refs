The provided content relates to CVE-2022-24265.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `menu_filter` parameter in the `/administrator/components/menu/` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
- Data access and disclosure: The attacker can read sensitive data from the database.
- Data manipulation: The attacker can modify or delete data in the database.
- Complete system compromise: In some cases, the attacker can gain full control over the underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a POST request.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `menu_filter` parameter in the `/administrator/components/menu/` endpoint

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite, suggesting that the vulnerability might be exploitable without prior authentication.
