Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `$id` parameter in the `/admin/news/sort_mod.php` file is not sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The direct inclusion of the unsanitized `$id` parameter into the SQL query allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database, modify existing data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server, depending on the database privileges and the specific database configuration.
- The attacker could gain access to user information, modify application behavior or cause denial of service by disrupting database operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter in the URL of the `/admin/news/sort_mod.php` page.
- Example payloads:
    - `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_mod.php?id=1'`
    - `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_mod.php?id=1 and 1=1`
    - `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_mod.php?id=1 and 1=2`
    - `http://xx.xx.com/admin/news/sort_mod.php?id=1 RLIKE SLEEP(2)`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the `/admin/news/sort_mod.php` page.
- They need to know that the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques and SQL syntax to be able to effectively exploit the vulnerability.
- Prior authentication is needed to access the vulnerable page.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided text suggests using tools like SQLmap to gather more information about the vulnerable application.
- The vulnerability is in `admin/news/sort_mod.php`, which is likely part of a content management system or similar web application.
- The provided code snippet is simple and does not sanitize the input before passing it to SQL query.
