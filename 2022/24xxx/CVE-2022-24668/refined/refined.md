- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logical error in the code path that handles ALTSVC and ORIGIN frames. These frames are not supported by swift-nio-http2, but instead of being ignored, a deliberate trap (intentional crash) was left in the code during development and never removed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of unsupported HTTP/2 frames (ALTSVC and ORIGIN) leading to a deliberate crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial of service (DoS) where the server crashes immediately upon receiving a malicious frame. This causes all in-flight connections to be dropped and the service to need a restart. Repeated sending of these frames by an attacker can result in a substantial denial of service. While the crash itself doesn't directly cause confidentiality or integrity issues, it can potentially lead to violations of invariants in services, possibly triggering errors that have such risks.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 ALTSVC or ORIGIN frame to a swift-nio-http2 server. The attack can be initiated by any HTTP/2 connection peer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to establish an HTTP/2 connection with the vulnerable server. For clients, this means any server they connect to can launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect can launch this attack. No special permissions or privileges are needed. The attack is considered low-effort due to the minimal resources needed to send the malicious frames.
