- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of validation of object existence before performing operations on the object during the parsing of JP2 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious JP2 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious JP2 file to the victim or lure the victim to a malicious page. User interaction is required.
