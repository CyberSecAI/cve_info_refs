- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the NetUSB.ko kernel module, leading to a read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable TP-Link AC1750 router. Authentication is not required.
