Reported by Joern Schneeweisz from GitLab GmbH:

> During an internal assessment on some GitLab code I came across a way
> to execute arbitrary commands in your asciidoctor-include-ext Gem.
>
> The following adoc snippet demonstrates the issue:
>
> ```
> :app-name: |id # + \
> <http://test.com>
>
> include::{app-name}[]
> ```
>
> It uses a linebreak to bypass the `target_uri` check here
> <https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-include-ext/blob/master/lib/asciidoctor/include_ext/include_processor.rb#L97>
> and feed a command with the `|` prefix to open/IO.foreach.
>
> You can verify this with the above snippet by rendering it like this
>
> ```
> asciidoctor -r asciidoctor-include-ext  -a allow-uri-read home.asciidoc
> ```

# Command Injection vulnerability in asciidoctor-include-ext

High

[jirutka](/jirutka)
published
GHSA-v222-6mr4-qj29
Mar 31, 2022

## Package

bundler

asciidoctor-include-ext
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

<0.4.0

## Patched versions

0.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Applications using [Asciidoctor (Ruby)](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor) with [asciidoctor-include-ext](https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-include-ext) (prior to version 0.4.0), which render user-supplied input in AsciiDoc markup, may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the host operating system. ~~This attack is possible even when `allow-uri-read` is disabled!~~ (EDIT: it’s not)

### Patches

The vulnerability has been fixed in commit [c7ea001](https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-include-ext/commit/c7ea001a597c7033575342c51483dab7b87ae155) (and further improved in [cbaccf3](https://github.com/jirutka/asciidoctor-include-ext/commit/cbaccf3de533cbca224bf61d0b74e4b84d41d8ee)), which is included in version [0.4.0](https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-include-ext/versions/0.4.0).

### Workarounds

```
require 'asciidoctor/include_ext'

class Asciidoctor::IncludeExt::IncludeProcessor
  # Overrides superclass private method to mitigate Command Injection
  # vulnerability in asciidoctor-include-ext <0.4.0.
  def target_uri?(target)
    target.downcase.start_with?('http://', 'https://') \
      && URI.parse(target).is_a?(URI::HTTP)
  rescue URI::InvalidURIError
    false
  end
end
```
