- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control within the httpd service of the TP-Link TL-WR940N router.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can disclose stored credentials, which could lead to further compromise of the device or network.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending requests to the httpd service listening on TCP port 80.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers must be network-adjacent to the vulnerable router. No authentication is required.
