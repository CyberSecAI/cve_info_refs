# Improper Input Validation in guzzlehttp/psr7

Moderate

[Nyholm](/Nyholm)
published
GHSA-q7rv-6hp3-vh96
Mar 20, 2022

## Package

composer

guzzlehttp/psr7
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=1.8.3
=>2.0.0, <=2.1.0

## Patched versions

1.8.4
2.1.1

## Description

### Impact

Improper header parsing. An attacker could sneak in a carriage return character (`\r`) and pass untrusted values in both the header names and values.

### Patches

The issue is patched in 1.8.4 and 2.1.1.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds.

### References

* <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.2.4>

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID
