{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper input validation when parsing HTTP headers. The code did not properly validate header values, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return characters (`\\r`) into header names or values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject untrusted values in both the header names and values by sneaking in carriage return characters (`\\r`). This could lead to various issues, such as HTTP header injection or other unexpected behaviors, depending on how the headers are used by the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with manipulated header values containing carriage return characters.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or user interaction are required."
