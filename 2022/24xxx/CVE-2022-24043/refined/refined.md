- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The login functionality of the application does not normalize the response times of login attempts performed with incorrect usernames with the response times of attempts performed with correct usernames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Observable discrepancy in login response times based on whether the username exists or not. This is a side-channel vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform username enumeration by observing the differences in response times of login attempts with different usernames, thereby identifying valid usernames on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
