# DOS in HTTP

High

[ubogdan](/ubogdan)
published
GHSA-xg75-q3q5-cqmv
Apr 18, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<1.2.5

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Allows an attacker to perform a DOS attack consisting of memory exhaustion on the host system.

### Patches

Yes. Please upgrade to v1.2.6.

### Workarounds

A workaround is to restrict the path prefix to the "GET" method. As shown below

```
func main() {
	r := mux.NewRouter()

	r.PathPrefix("/swagger/").Handler(httpSwagger.Handler(
		httpSwagger.URL("http://localhost:1323/swagger/doc.json"), //The url pointing to API definition
		httpSwagger.DeepLinking(true),
		httpSwagger.DocExpansion("none"),
		httpSwagger.DomID("#swagger-ui"),
	)).Methods(http.MethodGet)

```
