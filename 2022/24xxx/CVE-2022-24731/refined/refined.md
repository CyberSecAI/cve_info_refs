**Root cause of vulnerability:** Path traversal vulnerability in Argo CD's repo-server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal (CWE-22)
- Improper access control (CWE-284)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user with `create` or `update` access to Applications can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server.
- This includes files from other Application's source repositories (potentially decrypted files, if a decryption plugin is used) or any secrets mounted as files on the repo-server.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the location of the target file.
- Leaked information could include sensitive data such as decrypted secrets and other application's source code.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Attacker crafts a malicious Helm chart.
- The malicious Helm chart is used in an Argo CD Application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have `create` or `update` access to Applications within Argo CD.
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify Helm charts.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Argo CD repo-server.
