# Sensitive Auth & Cookie data stored in Jupyter server logs

High

[Zsailer](/Zsailer)
published
GHSA-p737-p57g-4cpr
Mar 22, 2022

## Package

pip

jupyter\_server
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<1.15.3

## Patched versions

1.15.4

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it?*

Anytime a 5xx error is triggered, the auth cookie and other header values are recorded in Jupyter Server logs by default. Considering these logs do not require root access, an attacker can monitor these logs, steal sensitive auth/cookie information, and gain access to the Jupyter server.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

Upgrade to Jupyter Server version 1.15.4

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or vulnerabilities to report, please email our security list security@ipython.org.

Credit: [@3coins](https://github.com/3coins) for reporting. Thank you!

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24757

### Weaknesses

[CWE-532](/advisories?query=cwe%3A532)
