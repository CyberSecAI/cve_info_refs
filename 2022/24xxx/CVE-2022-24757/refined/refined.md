Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24757:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Jupyter server, in versions prior to 1.15.4, logs all request headers, including authentication cookies and other sensitive information, to the server logs when a 5xx error occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive authentication and cookie data are being written to logs that are not protected with root access. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes user credentials.
- **CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File):** The vulnerability falls under the category of logging sensitive information, which is a common coding mistake.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who can access the server logs can steal sensitive auth/cookie information.
- Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Jupyter server.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs access to the Jupyter server logs. These logs typically don't require root access, so an attacker might gain access through other exploits or vulnerabilities.
- The attacker needs to cause a 5xx error on the Jupyter server to trigger the logging of sensitive information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have access to the server logs, which may not require root privileges, potentially through other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- The attacker must be able to trigger 5xx errors on the Jupyter server to force the logging of sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved modifying the logging mechanism to only log a subset of headers.
- The vulnerability was reported by @3coins.
- The advisory provides a link to the commit that addresses the vulnerability.
