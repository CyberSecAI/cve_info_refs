GHSA-fvwv-qcq6-wmp5
Jan 26, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=5.3.0

## Patched versions

5.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Attackers can access another player's inventory, allowing them to take or give items without permission.

### Patches

[3693b68](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commit/3693b6871eba268ecc79b3f52d00d3cefe761131)

### Workarounds

Create a new mod with the following content:

```
minetest.register_allow_player_inventory_action(function(player, action, inventory, inventory_info)
    local inventory_location = inventory:get_location()
    if inventory_location.type == "player" and inventory_location.name ~= player:get_player_name() then
        return 0
    end
end)
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Package        : minetest
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-24300 CVE-2022-24301
Debian Bug     : 1004223

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Minetest, a sandbox video game
and game creation system. These issues may allow attackers to manipulate game
mods and grant them an unfair advantage over other players. These flaws could
also be abused for a denial of service attack against a Minetest server or if
user input is passed directly to minetest.deserialize without serializing it
first, then a malicious user could run Lua code in the server environment.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.4.17.1+repack-1+deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.0+repack-2.1+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your minetest packages.

For the detailed security status of minetest please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/minetest>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>
