- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `HttpClient` responsible for sending requests to the Discord API was erroneously reused to send requests to the DisCatSharp website when fetching DisCatSharp team members.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by the reuse of the same `HttpClient` for both Discord API requests and requests to the DisCatSharp team's website. This resulted in the potential leakage of bot tokens to a non-Discord server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Bot tokens could be sent to a web server not affiliated with Discord, owned and operated by DisCatSharp's development team. Although the tokens were not logged, they could have been compromised.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when using either of the two `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute` attributes or the `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have a bot that used the affected versions of the DisCatSharp library and be using the `RequireDisCatSharpDeveloperAttribute` or the `BaseDiscordClient.LibraryDeveloperTeam` feature.
