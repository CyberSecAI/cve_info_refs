  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a bug in the Go `os/exec` package on Windows. When Git LFS attempts to execute a program not found in the system's PATH, it passes an empty string as the executable path to the `os/exec` package. On Windows, this results in the package prepending the current working directory (`.`) to the empty string, and searching for executable files with names like `..exe`, `..com`, etc., in the current directory. If such a file exists, it will be executed instead of the intended program.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of executable paths",
      "Reliance on current working directory for program execution on Windows"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on Windows systems. An attacker can create a malicious repository with a specially named executable file (`..exe`, `..com`) and a file with a base name of a program Git LFS intends to execute, such as `git.exe` or `cygpath.exe`. When a user attempts to clone or interact with this repository via Git LFS, the malicious executable will be launched instead of the intended one.",

The attacker would need to convince the victim to clone or otherwise operate on the repository via Git LFS on a Windows system where the intended executable is not found in the PATH environment variable.",
