# Git LFS can execute a binary from the current directory on Windows

High

[chrisd8088](/chrisd8088)
published
GHSA-6rw3-3whw-jvjj
Apr 19, 2022

## Package

gomod

git-lfs
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

2.12.1 - 3.1.2

## Patched versions

3.1.3+

## Description

### Impact

On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a `..exe` file as well as a file named `git.exe`, and `git.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems.

Similarly, if the malicious repository contains files named `..exe` and `cygpath.exe`, and `cygpath.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed when certain Git LFS commands are run.

More generally, if the current working directory contains any file with a base name of `.` and a file extension from `PATHEXT` (except `.bat` and `.cmd`), and also contains another file with the same base name as a program Git LFS intends to execute (such as `git`, `cygpath`, or `uname`) and any file extension from `PATHEXT` (including `.bat` and `.cmd`), then, on Windows, when Git LFS attempts to execute the intended program the `..exe`, `..com`, etc., file will be executed instead, but only if the intended program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH`.

The vulnerability occurs because when Git LFS detects that the program it intends to run does not exist in any directory listed in `PATH` then Git LFS passes an empty string as the executable file path to the Go `os/exec` package, which contains a bug such that, on Windows, it prepends the name of the current working directory (i.e., `.`) to the empty string without adding a path separator, and as a result searches in that directory for a file with the base name `.` combined with any file extension from `PATHEXT`, executing the first one it finds.

(The reason `..bat` and `..cmd` files are not executed in the same manner is that, although the Go `os/exec` package tries to execute them just as it does a `..exe` file, the Microsoft Win32 API `CreateProcess()` family of functions have an undocumented feature in that they apparently recognize when a caller is attempting to execute a batch script file and instead run the `cmd.exe` command interpreter, passing the full set of command line arguments as parameters. These are unchanged from the command line arguments set by Git LFS, and as such, the intended program's name is the first, resulting in a command line like `cmd.exe /c git`, which then fails.)

Git LFS has resolved this vulnerability by always reporting an error when a program is not found in any directory listed in `PATH` rather than passing an empty string to the Go `os/exec` package in this case.

The bug in the Go `os/exec` package has been reported to the Go project and is expected to be patched after this security advisory is published.

### Patches

The problem was introduced in v2.12.1 and is patched in v3.1.3 and v3.1.4. Users of affected versions should upgrade to v3.1.4.

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds at this time.

[Latest](/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/latest)

This release is a feature release which includes support for multi-stage

authentication with Git credential helpers (requires Git 2.46.0) and

relative worktree paths (requires Git 2.48.0), a new object transfer batch

size configuration option, better path handling when installing on Windows,

more POSIX-compliant hook scripts, and improved performance with sparse

checkouts, partial clones, and Git remotes with large numbers of tags.

Note that the 3.6.x series of Git LFS releases will be the last releases

for which we provide packages or support for versions of any Linux

distribution based on either Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHEL 7) or

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 (SLES 12).

Note also that the 3.6.x series of Git LFS releases may be the last

releases for which we provide packages or support for versions of any

Linux distribution based on Debian 10 ("buster").

This release is built using Go v1.23 and therefore on macOS systems

requires macOS 11 (Big Sur) or later, and on Windows systems requires

at least Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016 (although Windows 8.1 may

suffice).

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source

contributors:

* [@blanet](https://github.com/blanet) for fixing a crash bug when handling HTTP 429 responses
* [@bogomolets-owl](https://github.com/bogomolets-owl) for implementing a batch size configuration option
* [@ConcurrentCrab](https://github.com/ConcurrentCrab) for preventing hung SSH transfer protocol connections
* [@jochenhz](https://github.com/jochenhz) for ensuring files with Unicode names are not accidentally pruned
* [@pastelsky](https://github.com/pastelsky) for optimizing performance of our pre-push hook
* [@rustfix](https://github.com/rustfix) for correcting some code comments
* [@rusttech](https://github.com/rusttech) for fixing an array size allocation bug
* [@xdavidwu](https://github.com/xdavidwu) for improving the portability of our tests and hooks

[v3.4.0](/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/tag/v3.4.0)

This release is a feature release which includes support for generating

shell scripts for command-line tab-completion of Git LFS commands with

the new `git-lfs-completion(1)` command, providing multiple headers to Git

credential helpers (a new feature as of Git 2.41), and installing Git LFS

with a Git configuration file stored under the XDG configuration path.

Note that this release will be made by a different member of the core

team than the person who performed many of the past releases, and thus

this release will be signed with a different OpenPGP key. Please follow

[the steps in the README to download all of the keys for the core

team](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#verifying-releases) to verify this release.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source

This release is a feature release which includes package support for Red Hat

Enterprise Linux 9 and compatible OSes, experimental support for multiple

remotes, and some command-line helpers for `git lfs push`.

In this release, we no longer include vendored versions of our dependencies in

the repository or the tarballs. These were a source of noise and bloat, and

users can easily download the required dependencies with Go itself. Users who

need to continue to vendor the dependencies can use the `make vendor` target.

In addition, we've also switched the documentation to AsciiDoc from

ronn-flavoured Markdown and included the FAQ in the repository. This means that

the manual pages now render properly in the GitHub web interface and it's also

much easier to create additional formats, such as PDF, by leveraging the ability

of Asciidoctor to convert to DocBook.

It should also be noted that `git lfs migrate import --everything` now processes

all refs that aren't special to Git instead of just branches and tags. This is

what it was documented to do, but didn't, so we've fixed it.

Finally, please note that future releases may be done by a different member of

the core team than many of the past releases, and thus may be signed by a

different OpenPGP key. Please follow [the steps in the README to download all

of the keys for the core

team](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs#verifying-releases) to verify releases

successfully in the future.

This release is a feature release which includes support for machine-readable

formats for a couple more commands, plus the ability to automatically merge

LFS-based text files from the command-line. It's likely that the merge driver

will see future improvements, but if you have feedback on the design, please use

the discussions feature.

Note that our binary release archives no longer unpack into the current

directory, and now contain a top-level directory just like the source archives

do.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source

This release is a bugfix release which fixes a variety of problems seen since

3.0.0, including problems with empty files, `git lfs fsck --pointers`, and

the testsuite.

We would like to extend a special thanks to the following open-source

contributors:

* [@fh1ch](https://github.com/fh1ch) for patches to make things work better on Alpine Linux
* [@pyckle](https://github.com/pyckle) for fixing our handling of filenames in `git lfs migrate import`
* [@ycongal-smile](https://github.com/ycongal-smile) for fixing `git lfs migrate import` with similarly named files

### Bugs

### Misc
