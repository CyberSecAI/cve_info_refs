| Community Note  * Please vote on this issue by adding a üëç [reaction](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) to the original issue to help the community and maintainers prioritize this request. Searching for pre-existing feature requests helps us consolidate datapoints for identical requirements into a single place, thank you! * Please do not leave "+1" or other comments that do not add relevant new information or questions, they generate extra noise for issue followers and do not help prioritize the request. * If you are interested in working on this issue or have submitted a pull request, please leave a comment.  ---  Overview of the Issue I was just passing through the code and noticed that the GitLab webhook event validator code does not use a constant time comparison function to validate the webhook secret. In theory it would be possible to use a timing attack to recover this secret as an attacker and then forge webhook events. GitHub and Bitbucket event validator code is not vulnerable because they make use of HMACs as far as I can see.  The risk of this being exploited is probably fairly low so I think it's safe to report publicly like this.     [atlantis/server/controllers/events/gitlab\_request\_parser\_validator.go](https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/blob/e153cea2bf1305e71c4f6a958c1378e22caa0211/server/controllers/events/gitlab_request_parser_validator.go#L62-L67)  Lines 62 to 67 in [e153cea](/runatlantis/atlantis/commit/e153cea2bf1305e71c4f6a958c1378e22caa0211)   |  | // Validate secret if specified. | | --- | --- | |  | headerSecret := r.Header.Get(secretHeader) | |  | secretStr := string(secret) | |  | if len(secret) != 0 && headerSecret != secretStr { | |  | return nil, fmt.Errorf("header %s=%s did not match expected secret", secretHeader, headerSecret) | |  | } |      I will follow up with a PR to fix this shortly. |

### Threat Intelligence

EPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 15 Jul 2022

[CVE-2022-24912 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24912) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-208 ¬†(opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `github.com/runatlantis/atlantis/server/controllers/events` to version 0.19.7 or higher.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack in the webhook event validator code, which does not use a constant-time comparison function to validate the webhook secret. It can allow an attacker to recover this secret as an attacker and then forge webhook events.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5¬†high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed ‚Äúremotely exploitable‚Äù and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**
