**Root cause of vulnerability:** A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in TeamCity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to inject the malicious script into a field that is not properly sanitized within TeamCity. Then, the XSS payload would be executed when the affected page is viewed by another user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to insert a stored XSS payload in TeamCity. They would also need to know a victim will access the affected area to execute the payload.
