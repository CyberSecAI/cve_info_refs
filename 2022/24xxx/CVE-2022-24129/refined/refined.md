{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Shibboleth OIDC OP plugin does not validate the 'request_uri' parameter before issuing an HTTP-GET request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of validation of the 'request_uri' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can make the server running the plugin issue arbitrary HTTP-GET requests to services reachable by the server, potentially including services on the same server via localhost. An attacker can also discover the exact Shibboleth IdP version by making the OIDC OP plugin connect to an attacker-controlled service and inspecting the user agent header.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted authentication request containing a malicious 'request_uri' parameter to the Shibboleth Identity Provider.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need authentication and can access the IdP remotely."
