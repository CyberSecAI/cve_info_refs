- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `GetValue` function in multiple binaries of TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi devices does not validate the size of the destination buffer when copying data from flash memory. Specifically, it uses `strncpy` with the length of the source string to copy the value of a given configuration key to a destination buffer that could be smaller. This can lead to a classic buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A classic buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120) due to the lack of size validation in the `GetValue` function, which is used to retrieve configuration values from flash storage. The `strncpy` function, when used with the length of the source string, can write past the end of a destination buffer if the buffer is smaller.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by modifying configuration values. This can be done via the command line utility `cfm` or remotely using protobuf messages similar to those used by the TCL phone application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to either send crafted protobuf messages to the device or to access the device's command line. This would generally mean the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the device, or have some other access to the device, depending on the specific exploitation method used.

The report identifies that CVE-2022-24024 is one of 25 CVEs related to the same underlying issue in the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi device firmware. The `GetValue` function and its implementation are analyzed in detail to demonstrate the root cause of the vulnerability. It also notes that the vulnerability, as per MITREâ€™s definition, should technically have 1874 unique CVEs, but they are limiting the scope for practical purposes.
