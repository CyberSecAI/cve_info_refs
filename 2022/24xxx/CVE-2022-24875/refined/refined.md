Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24875:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the logging of sensitive user secrets to disk. Specifically, the `org.controller.js` file in the cve-services project logs the user's key (secret) as part of the `result` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Exposure:** User secrets are exposed by being logged to disk.
- **Insecure Logging:** The application logs sensitive information, violating the principle of least privilege and exposing potential compromise.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** User secrets (keys) are exposed to anyone with access to the logs, potentially leading to unauthorized access to systems or data controlled by those keys.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Access to logs:** Any user with access to the log files on the server where the `cve-services` application is running can potentially read the exposed secrets. This could be a malicious insider, or an attacker who has gained access to the system hosting the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to server logs:** The attacker must have access to the server file system containing the application's log files. This implies either local access or through a vulnerability that allows access to the file system, such as a remote file inclusion vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `src/controller/org.controller/org.controller.js` between lines 444 and 458.
- Line 444 sets `result.secret` to the user's key, which is then logged on line 458.
- The vulnerability affects `cve-service` version `1.1.1`. There is no patched version available.
- The GitHub Security Advisory references CWE-779 (Logging of Excessive Data).
- It is noted that the fix should be implemented in the `Master Branch` as a hotfix to `CVE Service 1.1.1` as well as in the `Dev Branch`
