- Root cause of vulnerability: The Whale browser allowed extensions to replace JavaScript files of the HWP viewer website.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  Extensions could replace JavaScript files of the HWP viewer website, which had access to local HWP files. This allowed malicious scripts to be injected into the HWP viewer.
- Impact of exploitation: When HWP files were opened, the replaced script could read the files, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- Attack vectors: A malicious extension installed in the Whale browser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create and publish a malicious extension that can replace the JavaScript files of the HWP viewer and convince users to install it.
