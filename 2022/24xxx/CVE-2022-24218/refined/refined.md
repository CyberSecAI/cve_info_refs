The provided content describes a vulnerability in a PHP script `delete_image.php`, which is likely part of a web application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the `file` parameter in the URL, allowing for arbitrary file deletion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The script uses the `$_GET['file']` parameter directly to construct a file path using `$folder . $file` without proper sanitization. This enables an attacker to supply relative paths such as `../test.txt` to traverse directories outside of the intended upload directory and delete arbitrary files on the server.
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `unlink()` function is used to delete a file on the server without proper validation of the file path or the file's location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially causing data loss, application malfunction, or denial of service.
- If critical system files are deleted the web server or the entire system might become unusable.
- An attacker can disrupt the normal functioning of the application by deleting important files.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a specific URL that includes a `file` parameter with a path traversal sequence, such as `../`, an attacker can navigate through the file system.
- The attacker sends a GET request with the malicious URL e.g. `http://xx.xx.com/admin/delete_image.php?file=../test.txt`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `delete_image.php` script
- The attacker needs to know or guess the structure of the directory tree and names of files that can be deleted through the vulnerable script.
