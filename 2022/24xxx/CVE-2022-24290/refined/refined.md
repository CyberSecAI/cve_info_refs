- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack overflow occurs in the `tcserver.exe` binary when parsing user input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to the application crashing. The CVSS score indicates a high potential for confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact, though this is in the context of a local attack vector.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring local access to the system. User interaction is required (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable Teamcenter application is installed and must be able to provide crafted user input to the `tcserver.exe` binary. The attacker does not need special privileges (PR:N)
