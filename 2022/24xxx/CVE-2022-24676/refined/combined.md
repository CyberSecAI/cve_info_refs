Vulnerability scope All versions prior to HYBBS 2.3.3 Vulnerability environment construction Clone the latest code factory library of HYBBS to the local, and then use phpstudy to build HYBBS. Vulnerability reproduction steps Make a malicious zip archive as shown below  [2022-02-07-16-46-39](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767306-58978ef7-035f-4fef-aff4-abcba6ea710a.png)  Upload malicious zip archives in the management background upload plugin function  [2022-02-07-16-50-42](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767339-1bd955e4-4ae9-48a0-bddf-5c98d3b3ec9f.png)  After uploading, it prompts that the upload was successful  [2022-02-07-16-52-20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767359-fd97800a-d407-4cf8-95de-11b91c8ba742.png)  It can be seen from the log of the folder monitoring software that HYBBS renamed the malicious compressed package and extracted it to the Plugin directory  [2022-02-07-16-54-43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767371-8b28406d-a81e-476c-a665-c8df96e8177f.png)  [2022-02-07-16-57-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767390-25a3eb0d-c127-453d-b5e7-7d5d61fbaebd.png) Vulnerability code analysis Locate the code of the plugin upload function  [2022-02-07-17-13-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767409-6f5b01e8-784a-48a4-9100-c9b631079329.png)  [2022-02-07-17-14-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24275308/152767438-0707d082-dcfb-4dfd-a4e0-68f5453bcd21.png)  HYBBS directly decompresses the compressed package and does not check the content of the compressed package, resulting in an arbitrary file upload vulnerability. |
