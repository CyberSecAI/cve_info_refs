{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the Evmos `x/claims` module's IBC middleware, which, without proper authorization checks, allows migration of claim records to any recipient address via IBC transfer messages. A malicious actor can exploit this by creating a custom chain with a modified `AnteHandler` that bypasses signature verification. This lets the attacker impersonate any sender and transfer the claim records to an address they control, effectively claiming airdrop funds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel",
      "CWE-322: Inadequate Handling of Data Insufficiently Protected by Cryptography"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can drain unclaimed airdrop funds from Cosmos and Osmosis eligible user addresses. By impersonating the sender, the attacker can migrate the claim records to an address they control, claim a portion of the airdrop rewards, and then claim the remainder after repeating the process for other addresses. This can lead to a complete loss of user funds.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based and involves the IBC protocol, requiring an attacker to create a malicious chain, connect it to Evmos via IBC, and send malicious IBC transfer messages. The attacker exploits the lack of proper authorization on the Evmos side of the IBC transfer process.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs advanced knowledge of IBC internals, the Cosmos SDK's `AnteHandler`, and the Evmos `x/claims` module. They need to be able to set up a malicious blockchain that bypasses signature verification for IBC transfers, and they need to control addresses on both the malicious chain and the Evmos network to complete the attack."
  },
  "additional_details": {
        "patched_versions": "The vulnerability is patched in versions >= 2.0.0 of Evmos. Users should upgrade to v2.0.1 or later.",
        "workarounds": "There are no workarounds available. The fix is state-machine breaking, requiring a coordinated network upgrade."
