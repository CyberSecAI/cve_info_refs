  "CVE-2022-24785": {
    "description": "jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting the value of the `of` option of the `.position()` util from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `of` option is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `of` option from untrusted sources.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from accepting the value of the `of` option of the `.position()` utility from untrusted sources in jQuery UI. Prior to version 1.13.0, this could lead to the execution of untrusted code because the value passed to this option was not properly sanitized.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Path traversal",
        "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command"
    ],
    "impact": "Execution of untrusted code, SQL Injection, Information Disclosure and potentially arbitrary code execution. A path traversal vulnerability can allow attackers to access or modify sensitive data or execute code outside of the intended scope. Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command can lead to SQL injection and potential data breaches.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Accepting untrusted input for the `of` option of the `.position()` utility in jQuery UI",
        "User provided locale string is directly used to switch moment locale",
		"URL-encoded NUL character in filename passed to XML parsing functions"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious string into the `of` option, control the locale string passed to moment.js, or inject a URL-encoded NUL character into XML parsing functions.",
    "affected_products": [
      "jQuery-UI versions prior to 1.13.0",
      "Tenable.sc versions 5.20.0 and earlier",
	  "PHP versions 7.3.x below 7.3.33, 7.4.x below 7.4.26 and 8.0.x below 8.0.13",
	  "Moment.js versions 1.0.1 through 2.29.1",
      "Multiple NetApp products",
	  "python-notebook versions prior to 6.4.0-4.fc35 (Fedora 35)",
       "python-notebook versions prior to 6.4.11-3.fc36 (Fedora 36)",
        "Red Hat Single Sign-On versions prior to 7.6.2",
        "Red Hat Ceph Storage versions prior to 5.3",
		"Tenable Nessus 10.x < 10.3.1",
		"Nessus Network Monitor < 6.2.0",
		"Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh 2.0.11, 2.1.5",

		"Atlassian Confluence 7.19.x < 7.19.26"
    ],
    "remediation": "Upgrade jQuery UI to version 1.13.0 or later. Sanitize user-provided locale names before passing them to moment.js. Apply patches provided by vendors. For PHP, use secure coding practices and ensure appropriate validation of file paths."
