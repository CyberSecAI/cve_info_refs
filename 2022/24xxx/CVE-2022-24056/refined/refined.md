- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running Sante DICOM Viewer Pro.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing the user to either visit a malicious web page or open a malicious J2K file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious J2K file and the user must interact by either visiting a malicious page or opening the crafted J2K file.
