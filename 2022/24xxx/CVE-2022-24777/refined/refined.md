Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24777:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect logic in handling `GOAWAY` frames within the `grpc-swift` server. The vulnerability is triggered by a specific sequence of HTTP/2 frames.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reachable assertion: The flawed logic leads to an assertion failure, which crashes the server. This is due to how the server manages its internal state when handling `GOAWAY` frames.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting the vulnerability causes the server to crash, leading to a denial of service. This results in all in-flight connections and requests being dropped, severely impacting availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be carried out remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to send a crafted sequence of HTTP/2 frames to the `grpc-swift` server. No special privileges or user interaction are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered through automated fuzz testing.
- The fix involves correcting the state handling code related to GOAWAY frames.
- The attack is considered low-effort, requiring minimal resources to construct and send the malicious frame sequence.
- The vulnerability is considered high severity.
