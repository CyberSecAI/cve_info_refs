#### Minor version update

Security update released.

 **How to protect ?**

If you are currently on the 5.x (from 5.0.0 to 5.3.5) or 7.0.0 version, do not open Logs tab in the admin panel if you do not see the check mark symbol (✓) after the tab label. This symbol (✓) is added by the patch and informs an administrator about sucessfully applied patch.

**Solution**:
How to fix the issues immidiately without upgrade to a new version?

We have prepaired a simple executable utility to fix the issue.  [Download it from here](download.aspx?type=HCMIFIX), put it into the application folder (default is c:\inetpub\htcomnet ) on the web server and execute.
This utiliy performs search and replace of particular string in JS files of the admin panel.

If you do not want to execute exe file, you can edit js files manually or simply perform an upgrade to the most recent version.

Here are the steps to apply fix manually without upgrade:

1. Open `HTCOMENT/Scripts/admin/[used-theme-name]/app.js` file in a text editor.
   Where `[used-theme-name]` is the name of the theme specified in the `StyleThemeName` setting ('triton' by default for 5.x version and 'main' for version 7 ).
2. Search for the `"{more_info}"`
3. and replace it with the `"{more_info:htmlEncode}"`
4. Save the file.

Fixed versions of the HTTP Commander:

* v7.0.2 :
  [Forms](/download.aspx?type=st)
  [Windows](/download.aspx?type=ad)
  [Installer](/download.aspx?type=hcinst)
* v5.3.6 :
  [Forms](/download.aspx?type=st-5)
  [Windows](/download.aspx?type=ad-5)
  [Installer](/download.aspx?type=hcinst-5)
2021Tuesday, November 30, 2021
#### MS Windows KB5007192 brakes deleagtion

"Folder does not exist" error message is displayed after installition of the KB5007192 (Nov 2021 security update) on the DC when users tryies to access **network** folder from the HTTP Commander in case if **delegation** is required for this .
Affected auth types: **Windows integrated, ADFS, Azure AD**.

If HTTP Commander worked fine and suddenly started to fail load network folder, then most probably it is related to the KB5007192.

* Server 2012 R2 - [KB5008603](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5008603-authentication-fails-on-domain-controllers-in-certain-kerberos-scenarios-on-windows-server-2012-r2-1beea7a1-9a3c-48dd-a56d-c3cc3f5d0d50)
* Server 2016 - [KB5008601](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/november-14-2021-kb5008601-os-build-14393-4771-out-of-band-c8cd33ce-3d40-4853-bee4-a7cc943582b9)
* Server 2019 - [KB5008602](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/november-14-2021-kb5008602-os-build-17763-2305-out-of-band-8583a8a3-ebed-4829-b285-356fb5aaacd7)

#### JavaPowUpload Java 8 u131 security fix

- JavaPowUpload \*.jar files are re-signed with stronger sign algorithm to make JPU compatible with Java 8u131. [Download fixed build](/download.aspx?type=javapow).

JDK 1.8 u131 release introduces a new restriction on how MD5 signed JAR files are verified. If the signed JAR file uses MD5, signature verification operations will ignore the signature and treat the JAR as if it were unsigned.

Therefore all JavaPowUpload releases signed before April 2017 would not work anymore with Java release 8u131 and later.

## What is HTTP Commander?

##### web based file management

---

**HTTP Commander** is a web based file management solution hosted on your own server.
It provides a basic functionality for working with files (creating, coping, deleting, etc.) and many other additional features such as the integration with cloud services, editing Office documents online directly in your browser, tags, comments, and more.

It's ideal for the integration into an **existing Active Directory** Structure, since you can use your existing user base, existing network shares and NTFS permissions. With HTTP Commander you can configure external access to existing SMB shares within 10 minutes.

It also can be used **without an AD**, so users can register themselves, administrators can manage the users directly within the application.

HTTP Commander helps you quickly organize external access to internal folders/files (located within the organization) for employees to **Work From Home**.

HTTP Commander is hosted on your own server. You pay for the license only once and there are no recurring payments.

You save up to 10 times compared to the cloud services.
