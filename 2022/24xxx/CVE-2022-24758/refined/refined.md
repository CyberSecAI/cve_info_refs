- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a 5xx error occurs, the Jupyter server logs the authentication cookie and other header values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive authentication and cookie data are logged to server logs. These logs do not require root access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker monitoring the logs can steal sensitive authentication and cookie data, gaining unauthorized access to the Jupyter server.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need access to the Jupyter server logs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Jupyter server logs. This does not require root access.
