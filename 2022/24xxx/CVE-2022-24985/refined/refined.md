Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-24985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect access control implementation in JQueryForm.com's generated forms. Specifically, the authentication status of a user is stored in the `$_SESSION['authenticated']` variable. This variable is checked before validating credentials, allowing an attacker with a valid session on one form to bypass authentication checks on other forms hosted on the same server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect Access Control: The application relies on a single session variable for authentication across all forms, leading to session riding.
- Lack of proper credential checks: The application checks for an authenticated session before validating user-specific credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker with valid admin access to one form can gain unauthorized administrative access to other forms on the same server.
- Information Disclosure: An attacker may access sensitive information within the administrative sections of other forms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote exploitation: The attack is performed remotely over the network.
- Session Riding: An attacker needs to have a valid administrative session on one JQueryForm.com instance to compromise other forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated on at least one form hosted by the same server.
- The attacker must be able to access the other forms hosted on the same server.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability is only relevant when an organization hosts multiple forms generated by JQueryForm.com on the same server.
- The vendor confirmed and fixed the vulnerability on February 11, 2022.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Paul Bisso at nou Systems, Inc.
