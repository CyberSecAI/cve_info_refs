    "summary": "The provided content discusses a prototype poisoning vulnerability in the `qs` library, identified as CVE-2022-24999. It allows attackers to create `__proto__` properties on output JavaScript objects, leading to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by setting an unreasonable length value on array-like objects.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the vulnerable versions of the 'qs' library allowing the creation of \"__proto__\" properties on the output JavaScript objects.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype pollution vulnerability in the `qs` library.",
        "The library allows setting an Array in the “__proto__” property, creating “array-like” objects that inherit the Array prototype but also allow setting the \"length\" property.",
        "Setting an unreasonable 'length' value on these objects freezes the Node.js process when attempting to convert them to string values or by calling native Array functions."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation leads to applicative Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, where an unreasonable \"length\" value set on the crafted array-like objects freezes the Node.js process when string conversions or native array functions are called.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By sending a crafted query string that includes the `__proto__` property and a large length value to a vulnerable Node.js application.",
        "Specifically, a payload like `categories[_proto__]&categories[_proto__]&categories[length]=100000000` or `someString[_proto__]&someString[_proto__]&someString[length]=100000000` can be used to trigger the vulnerability."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with crafted query parameters to a Node.js application using a vulnerable version of the 'qs' library and running with default Express configuration. No special privileges are required, making this vulnerability easily exploitable remotely."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content offers more details than a typical CVE description, including specific examples of how the vulnerability can be exploited and the resulting effects on a Node.js application."
