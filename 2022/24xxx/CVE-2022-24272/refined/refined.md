Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24272:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect validation of requests on the `$external` database during command dispatch. This improper validation can lead to an invariant assertion being triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is a lack of proper validation for requests targeting the `$external` database. This allows unexpected inputs to reach the command dispatch process.
- **Reachable Assertion:** The improper validation leads to a reachable assertion, which is a condition that, when violated, causes the program to halt or terminate unexpectedly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The triggered assertion can cause the `mongod` server process to crash, rendering the database unavailable.
- **Server Crash:** The crashing of the server process is a direct consequence of the invariant assertion failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is network accessible, as implied by the CVSS score (AV:N).
- **Authenticated User:** Exploitation requires an authenticated user with the ability to send commands to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the MongoDB server.
- **Command Execution:**  The attacker needs the ability to execute commands against the database.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker needs to craft requests that trigger the invariant assertion, which may require some knowledge of the internal validation process on the `$external` database.

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS:3.1 score of 6.5 with metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
