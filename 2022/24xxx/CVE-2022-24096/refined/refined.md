Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-24096:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A stack-based buffer overflow exists in Adobe After Effects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The CVSS vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` indicates the following:
    - **AV:L (Local):**  The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
    - **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low, implying that the attack is easy to perform.
    - **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:R (User Interaction Required):** User interaction is required for the exploit to be successful (e.g., opening a malicious file).
    - **S:U (Unchanged):** The security scope is unchanged, meaning the vulnerability impacts the same security authority as the vulnerable component.
    - **C:H (High):** Confidentiality impact is high.
    - **I:H (High):** Integrity impact is high.
    - **A:H (High):** Availability impact is high.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires local access to the target system.
- The attacker needs to induce a user to perform an action, likely opening a malicious file, for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability affects Adobe After Effects versions 22.2 and earlier, as well as versions 18.4.4 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is categorized as critical.
- Adobe recommends updating to version 22.2.1 or 18.4.5 to remediate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Yongjun Liu of nsfocus security team.
