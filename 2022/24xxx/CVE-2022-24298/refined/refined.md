Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `FreeOpcUa/freeopcua` package where sending multiple `CloseSession` requests with the `deleteSubscription` parameter set to `False` bypasses limitations for excessive memory consumption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Denial of service, leading to system inaccessibility to legitimate users.
- Total loss of availability, which can be sustained or persistent.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks. The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and is remotely exploitable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or user interaction. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
- No specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted `CloseSession` requests with `deleteSubscription` set to `False`.
- There is currently no fixed version available for the vulnerable package.
- The vulnerability is classified as a High severity issue.
- A proof-of-concept exploit exists and the probability of exploitation is relatively low, according to the provided EPSS score.
