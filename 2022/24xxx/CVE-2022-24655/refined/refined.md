The provided content contains information regarding two vulnerabilities: a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability (PSV-2021-0282) and a pre-authentication stack overflow vulnerability (PSV-2021-0288).

**Vulnerability 1: Pre-Authentication Command Injection (PSV-2021-0282)**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability
*   **Weaknesses:** Allows execution of arbitrary commands due to insufficient input sanitization.
*  **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access, control of the device, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local area network (LAN) access is required. This implies that the attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Vulnerability 2: Pre-Authentication Stack Overflow (PSV-2021-0288)**
*   **Root Cause:** Stack overflow vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Allows overwriting of stack memory, due to lack of boundary checks when handling certain input.
*   **Impact:**  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, device crash, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based, requires access to the local area network (LAN).
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.

**Affected Products and Fixes:**

*   **Command Injection:**
    *   Affected: EX6100v1 (Extender). No fix is available as the device is outside of the security support period.
*   **Stack Overflow:**
    *   Affected: Multiple products.
    *   Fixed:
        *   CAX80 (Cable Modem Router) fixed in firmware version 2.1.3.7
        *   DC112A (Aircard) fixed in firmware version 1.0.0.64

**Additional Information:**

*   No workarounds are available.
*   The vulnerabilities are pre-authentication, meaning they can be exploited without requiring user login or authentication.
*   The vulnerabilities require access to the local area network to be exploited.
*   The advisory provides CVSS v3 scores for both vulnerabilities

**CVSS v3 Scores**
*   PSV-2021-0282: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L  (Local Access, High Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Scope Unchanged, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, Low Availability Impact)
*   PSV-2021-0288: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L (Network Access, High Attack Complexity, No Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Scope Unchanged, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, Low Availability Impact)
