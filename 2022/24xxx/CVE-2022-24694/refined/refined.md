Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24694:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Incorrect access control in the 'Files' area of Mahara. The application failed to properly verify if a user had the right permissions to access a folder. Specifically, it did not prevent a user from seeing the name of a folder that they did not own.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The core issue is that the system allowed access to folder names based on the folder ID passed in the URL without checking ownership.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed users to see the names of folders they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker (any logged-in user) can view the names of folders created by other users.
*   The vulnerability was described as an "escalation of privilege" as it allows a user to see information they should not be able to.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** By manually crafting a URL with a specific folder ID, an attacker could view the folder name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Mahara system (logged in) to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of folder ID:** The attacker needs to obtain a folder ID (which could be obtained via a user who does have access).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only disclosed folder names; files and file names were not affected.
*   The issue was resolved in Mahara versions 20.10.4, 21.04.3, and 21.10.1.
*   The vulnerability was classified as a "High" importance issue.
*   The attack type is "Remote", meaning it could be exploited over a network.
* The fix has been backported to older branches of mahara as well
