### Bug Description

Problem when passing in folder id to a 'Files' page - we can see the name of a folder that we don't own

Testing steps:

1) Create a site with at least two accounts, personA and personB

2) Log in as personA and go to Create -> Files (artefact/file/index.php) page

3) Create a folder, say 'SubFolder', hover mouse over folder to find the ID of the folder, eg '&folder=123'. Make a note of the value and then click into that folder

4) Upload a file to the folder

5) Reload the page and you should be in the home directory of the Files area

6) Change the URL and add to the end the folder id (eg artefact/file/index.php?folder=123) and reload - you should now see that the page loads with you in the folder you created

7) Log out

8) Log in as personB and go to Create -> Files (artefact/file/index.php) page

9) Change the URL and add to the end the folder id (eg artefact/file/index.php?folder=123) and reload

Expected: As you are not the folder owner you should not go to that folder

Actual: The name of the other person's folder displays on the screen (plus errors in dev mode)

As this is an escalation of privilege I'll make it a security bug

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.
