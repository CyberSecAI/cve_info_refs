Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-24705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs when processing RADIUS packets with invalid attribute lengths. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered by attribute types `ipv4addr`, `ipv6addr`, `ipv6prefix`, or `ifid`

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:**  The code did not properly validate the attribute length field in the RADIUS packet against the expected size for the given attribute type, leading to a buffer overflow when copying the attribute data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful buffer overflow could lead to various impacts, including:
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Crashing the application by corrupting memory.
    - **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Potentially allowing an attacker to execute malicious code on the server if they could control the overflowed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted RADIUS packet with an invalid attribute length to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send RADIUS packets to the vulnerable server. This could be an attacker on the same network or an attacker who has access to the RADIUS server.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved adding proper size checks when processing radius packets with specific attribute types, preventing the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability was reported by Chloe Ong, Eugene Lim, and Kar Wei Loh.
- The fix was implemented and merged into the master branch of the accel-ppp project.
- The vulnerability is located within the accel-ppp project.
