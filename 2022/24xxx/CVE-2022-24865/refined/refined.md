Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24865:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper access control in the HumHub application when a user is forced to change their password. Specifically, the `AccessControl` behavior in `protected/humhub/components/behaviors/AccessControl.php`  incorrectly handled the redirection and access checks when a user was required to change their password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the lack of proper access control when a user is in the "must change password" state. After being forced to change the password, users should have been restricted to a limited set of actions, such as changing their password. Instead, they retained access to other parts of the application.
- The code was modified to remove return values from the `codeCallback` function which was being used for actions such as "must change password". The return statement was preventing the redirection to the change password page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Users who were forced to change their password could perform actions they should not have access to while in this state.
- **Data Retrieval:** The vulnerability allowed users to retrieve other users' data, suggesting a bypass of access restrictions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to have an account within the HumHub application, and the account would need to be forced to change password by an administrator.
- The user would then be able to perform actions and retrieve data that would normally not be available while in the "must change password" state.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a user account within the HumHub instance.
- The user account must be in a state where it is forced to change the password by an admin.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in HumHub versions prior to 1.8.
- Patches are available in versions 1.11.0, 1.10.4, and 1.9.4.
- The fix involves modifying the `AccessControl.php` file. Specifically, the return statement in the code callback was removed, and the redirection to the change password page was performed in the same block.
