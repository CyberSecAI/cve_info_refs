- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the NT Apex One RealTime Scan Service. It can be exploited by creating a DOS device redirection, which then allows an attacker to abuse the service to create a folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability involves an improper handling of DOS device redirections by the NT Apex One RealTime Scan Service, leading to arbitrary folder creation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a foothold on the target system with the ability to execute low-privileged code. They must then be able to create a DOS device redirection to trigger the vulnerability.
