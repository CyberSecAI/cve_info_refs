Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2022-24126:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two bugs within the matchmaking functionality of FromSoftware games, specifically Dark Souls III.

1.  **No Bounds Check in Entry List Parser:** The game doesn't properly validate the size field in the length-delimited data entries when processing matchmaking data. This allows an attacker to specify a large size, leading to an out-of-bounds read and memory allocation failure. This also sets up a subsequent vulnerability by controlling the `data_size` field of a `DLMemoryInputStream` object.
2.  **Buffer Overrun in `NRSessionSearchResult` Parser:** When parsing the `NRSessionSearchResult` object, which contains player information, the game uses fixed-size stack buffers to store data, including the host's Steam persona name. It doesn't perform bounds checking when copying the host's name, allowing an attacker to write past the buffer's boundaries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:**  The lack of size validation in the entry list parser leads to out-of-bounds reads, which could cause crashes and contribute to other exploits.
*   **Stack buffer overflow:**  The absence of bounds checking in the `NRSessionSearchResult` parser creates a stack buffer overflow, enabling the attacker to overwrite parts of the stack.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE/RCE):** The combination of stack overflow and out of bounds read allows for arbitrary code execution via a carefully crafted payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
*   **Widespread Impact:**  The vulnerability is present in multiple FromSoftware titles.
*   **Targeted Attacks:** The vulnerability allows for targeted attacks via the matchmaking server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Matchmaking Push Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via specially crafted `NRSessionSearchResult` data transmitted through matchmaking push requests. These are sent during various multiplayer activities, such as:
    *   Summoning
    *   Dark Spirit Invasions
    *   Covenant Joining
    *   Arena Matches
*   **`RequestSendMessageToPlayers`:** This request allows attackers to send arbitrary push messages to specific players using their IDs, meaning that a large number of players can be targeted at once, regardless of their current multiplayer status.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the game servers and be able to send matchmaking requests.
*   **Malicious Client:** The attacker must use a modified game client or tool capable of creating and sending the malicious matchmaking data.
*   **Knowledge of Player IDs (for targeted attacks):** If the attacker wishes to target specific users, they need to know their player IDs. However, they can send messages to large subsets of the userbase in order to hit targeted players or attempt widespread exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit leverages the structure of a `DLMemoryInputStream` object on the stack, using the overflow to overwrite the vftable pointer and redirect execution to attacker-controlled memory.
*   The exploit chain uses gadgets within the game's code to redirect execution, copy the attacker's payload, and then execute the shellcode.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) code for Dark Souls III is available.
*   The vulnerability was patched in Dark Souls III version 1.15.1.
