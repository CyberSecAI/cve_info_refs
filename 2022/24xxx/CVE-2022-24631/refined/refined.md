```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `desc` parameter of the `ajaxTenants.php` script.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request to the `/admin/AudioCodes_files/ajax/ajaxTenants.php` script with a crafted `desc` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`desc`). No authentication is explicitly required to inject the malicious payload.
