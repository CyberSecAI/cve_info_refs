- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `$id` parameter from the HTTP request is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to potentially access, modify, or delete database information. They can also use techniques like `SLEEP` to cause denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP GET request, by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
