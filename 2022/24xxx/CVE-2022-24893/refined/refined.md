- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a missing check for the `SegN` field in the Transaction Start PDU during the provisioning process of Espressif's Bluetooth Mesh SDK (`ESP-BLE-MESH`). Specifically, while the `TotalLength` field is checked, the `SegN` field is not validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation for the `SegN` field. This allows an attacker to send a crafted Provisioning PDU with an invalid `SegN` value, leading to a buffer overflow. The vulnerability is classified under CWE-787 (Out-of-bounds Write) and CWE-788 (Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer).
- **Impact of exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause a memory corruption issue. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and potentially enable an attacker to gain full control over the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted Provisioning PDU to a vulnerable device over Bluetooth during the provisioning phase.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the target device and have the ability to send Bluetooth Mesh provisioning packets.
