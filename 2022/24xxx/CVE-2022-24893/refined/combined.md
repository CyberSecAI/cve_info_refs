# Espressif Bluetooth Mesh Stack Vulnerability

Moderate

[mahavirj](/mahavirj)
published
GHSA-7f7f-jj2q-28wm
Jun 23, 2022

## Package

ESP-BLE-MESH
(ESP-IDF)

## Affected versions

v4.4.1
v4.3.2
v4.2.3
v4.1.3

## Patched versions

v4.4.2
v4.3.3
v4.2.4
v4.1.4

## Description

### Software Component

ESP BLE Mesh: <https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/components/bt/esp_ble_mesh>

Documentation: <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/bluetooth/esp-ble-mesh.html>

### Impact

In Espressif’s Bluetooth Mesh SDK (`ESP-BLE-MESH`), a memory corruption vulnerability can be triggered during provisioning, because there is no check for the `SegN` field of the Transaction Start PDU. This can result in memory corruption related attacks and potentially attacker gaining control of the entire system.

Normally there are two fields in the Transaction Start PDU that need to be checked, i.e., the `TotalLength` field and the `SegN` field. Since we only checked the `TotalLength` field, an attacker can send a Provisioning PDU with an invalid `SegN` field, which will cause the message handled by the firmware to be much larger than the current buffer could store, thus causing a memory corruption issue to global buffer.

### Patches

Patched versions of ESP-IDF Framework are listed below:

| Branch | Commit ID |
| --- | --- |
| master | < [5a87a9c](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/5a87a9c65e00fd2ffc120c56f32e9f8145e8a11c) > |
| release/v4.4 | < [c412085](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/c41208550aef5f4782aa90ab3a710e53063a615b) > |
| release/v4.3 | < [b4ef1b8](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/b4ef1b80a217a6e9171e9f5b1c6fab7c4c3c649b) > |
| release/v4.2 | < [8b422cd](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/8b422cd8b14b0a1ee6c79f37ef8ece987de367dc) > |
| release/v4.1 | < [3cc92c9](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/commit/3cc92c92dc72fd546d326e612604592034ae5e57) > |

### Workarounds

The upgrade is applicable for all applications and users of `ESP-BLE-MESH` component from `ESP-IDF`. As it is implemented in the Bluetooth Mesh stack, there is no workaround for the user to fix the application layer without upgrading the underlying firmware.

### References

None Applicable
