Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the parsing of J2K (JPEG 2000) images by Sante DICOM Viewer Pro. Specifically, crafted data in a J2K file can cause a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The software does not properly validate the size of data being written during J2K image processing, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can leverage the out-of-bounds write to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Sante DICOM Viewer Pro process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious J2K file: The attacker crafts a specially crafted J2K file.
- User interaction: The user must either visit a malicious webpage or open the crafted J2K file using Sante DICOM Viewer Pro.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create malicious J2K files and trick the user into opening it with the vulnerable software.
- The attacker does not require prior privileges or access to the system other than the user interaction aspect to trigger the exploit.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in DICOM Viewer Pro version 11.9.2.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-09-17 and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred on 2022-02-02.
