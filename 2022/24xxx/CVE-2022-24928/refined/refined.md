Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24928:

**1. Verification:**

The provided document contains information about a security vulnerability with the identifier **SVE-2021-22380**, which is associated with **CVE-2022-24928** and has the following description: "Security misconfiguration of RKP in some devices". The document provides more detail than the short description for the CVE and thus confirms that it is related.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a security misconfiguration within the kernel related to RKP (Real-time Kernel Protection). The RKP was not being enabled, resulting in the system not being protected by RKP.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - **Security Misconfiguration:** The core vulnerability is that the RKP protection, designed to secure the kernel, was not enabled on affected devices. This exposed the system to potential kernel-level attacks and exploits.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - The impact of this vulnerability is that a system is not protected by RKP. With RKP disabled, the device becomes vulnerable to kernel-level exploits.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is not explicitly detailed in the provided text, but it is implied that a local attacker (or malware) able to execute code in kernel space could take advantage of the disabled RKP and gain elevated privileges or perform malicious activities.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker would need to have the capability to execute code at the kernel level, which is generally achieved through exploiting another vulnerability or by having root/administrative access to the system. Local access is necessary for exploiting the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- **SVE-2021-22380 (CVE-2022-24928): Security misconfiguration of RKP in some devices**
- **Severity:** High
- **Affected versions:** Selected R(11) devices
- **Reported on:** June 30, 2021
- **Disclosure status:** Privately disclosed.
- **Description:** Security misconfiguration of RKP in kernel prior to SMR Mar-2022 Release 1 allows a system not to be protected by RKP.
- **Resolution:** The patch enables the flag for RKP protection.
