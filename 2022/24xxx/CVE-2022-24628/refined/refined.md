Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `id` parameter of the `IPPhoneFirmwareEdit.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where attacker-controlled input is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete arbitrary data within the application's database. This could include sensitive user credentials, configuration details, or other critical information. An attacker could also potentially achieve remote code execution by manipulating database entries.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to `/admin/AudioCodes_files/IPPhoneFirmwareEdit.php`.
- The `id` parameter within the URL is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target server.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit demonstrates how an attacker can craft a malicious URL by injecting the following into the `id` parameter:
```
-1338'%20UNION%20ALL%20SELECT%20NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--%20-
```
This SQL injection string is designed to perform a UNION ALL operation, retrieving data from the database.
