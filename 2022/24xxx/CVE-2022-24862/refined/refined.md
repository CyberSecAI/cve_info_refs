The content is related to CVE-2022-24862.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `Database extension -JDBC driver download address` function. During the download verification process, the system downloads the JDBC driver from the provided URL. The system does not properly validate the provided URL, which results in the system attempting to download from arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to lack of proper URL validation when downloading JDBC drivers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks. By providing a malicious URL as the JDBC driver download address, the attacker can force the server to make requests to internal or external resources. This can lead to information disclosure, unauthorized access, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker provides a malicious URL within the "Database extension-JDBC Driver Download Address" field. This can be a URL to internal resources or an external resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to create a new database extension and a project within the system in order to exploit the SSRF vulnerability. They need to have access to the Databasir application to perform these actions.
