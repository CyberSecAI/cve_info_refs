{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The ecdsautils library did not properly verify that the signature values 'r' and 's' were non-zero. Specifically, the `ecdsa_verify_prepare_legacy` function did not check for zero values, allowing a signature consisting of only zeros to be considered valid.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper verification of cryptographic signatures, specifically ECDSA signatures.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can forge valid signatures, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches, depending on the application using ecdsautils.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves providing a forged signature consisting entirely of zeroes to the ecdsautils library or CLI tool for verification.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to provide input to the vulnerable ecdsautils component, which could be a CLI tool or a library embedded in another application."
