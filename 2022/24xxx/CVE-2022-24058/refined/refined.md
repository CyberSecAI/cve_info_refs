- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the parsing of J2K files within Sante DICOM Viewer Pro.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafted data within a J2K file, leading to a write operation beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer. This is a classic buffer overflow issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the Sante DICOM Viewer Pro application. This could lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a malicious J2K file. This could be achieved through social engineering or by hosting the malicious file on a website and tricking the user into downloading it. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious J2K file and convince a user to open it. They do not need to be present on the local network. The exploit is triggered through local user interaction.
