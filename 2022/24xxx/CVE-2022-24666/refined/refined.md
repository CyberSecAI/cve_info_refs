- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logical error when parsing a HTTP/2 HEADERS frame where the frame contains priority information without any other data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The parsing error leads to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial of service attack, where the process crashes, dropping all in-flight connections, and requiring a service restart. Repeated attacks are easy to achieve and can cause substantial denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 HEADERS frame with priority information but without any other data, can be sent by any HTTP/2 connection peer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Any peer with a network connection to the vulnerable service can send the malicious frame.
