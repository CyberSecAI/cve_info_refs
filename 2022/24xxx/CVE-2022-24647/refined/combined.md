| Vulnerability Name: Multiple Arbitrary File Deletion  Date of Discovery: 06 Feb 2022  Product version:cuppaCMS v1.0[Download link](http://cuppacms.com/files/cuppa_cms.zip)  Author: lyy  Vulnerability Description: When unsanitized user input is supplied to a file deletion function, an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability arises. This occurs in PHP when the unlink() function is called and user input might affect portions of or the whole affected parameter, which represents the path of the file to remove, without sufficient sanitization. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to delete any file in the web root (along with any other file on the server that the PHP process user has the proper permissions to delete). Furthermore, an attacker can leverage the capability of arbitrary file deletion to circumvent certain webserver security mechanisms such as deleting .htaccess file that would deactivate those security constraints.
