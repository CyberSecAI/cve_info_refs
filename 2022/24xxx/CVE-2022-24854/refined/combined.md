# SQLite allows "FDW" to other SQLite databases bypassing any permissions

Moderate

[diogormendes](/diogormendes)
published
GHSA-vm79-xvmp-7329
Apr 14, 2022

## Package

Metabase OSS and Enterprise
(Metabase)

## Affected versions

<x.42.3 <x.41.6

## Patched versions

0.42.4,1.42.4,0.41.7,1.41.7

## Description

### Impact

SQLite has an FDW-like feature called [ATTACH DATABASE](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_attach.html), which allows connecting multiple SQLite databases via the initial connection. If the attacker has SQL permissions to at least one SQLite database, then it can attach this database to a second database, and then it can query across all the tables. To be able to do that the attacker also needs to know the file path to the second database.

### Patches

The following patches (or greater versions) are available:

* 0.42.4 and 1.42.4
* 0.41.7 and 1.41.7

If you use SQLite databases, where other users can write SQL queries, you should upgrade immediately.

All releases are available on <https://github.com/metabase/metabase/releases>

### Credits

Reported by <https://github.com/Cl0wnK1n9> via security@ email

### CVE ID

The ATTACH DATABASE statement adds another database
file to the current [database connection](c3ref/sqlite3.html).
Database files that were previously attached can be removed using
the [DETACH DATABASE](lang_detach.html) command.

# 2. Details

The filename for the database to be attached is the value of
the expression that occurs before the AS keyword.
The filename of the database follows the same semantics as the
filename argument to [sqlite3\_open()](c3ref/open.html) and [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](c3ref/open.html); the
special name "[:memory:](inmemorydb.html)" results in an [in-memory database](inmemorydb.html) and an
empty string results in a new temporary database.
The filename argument can be a [URI filename](uri.html) if URI filename processing
is enabled on the database connection. The default behavior is for
URI filenames to be disabled, however that might change in a future release
of SQLite, so application developers are advised to plan accordingly.

The name that occurs after the AS keyword is the name of the database
used internally by SQLite.
The schema-names 'main' and
'temp' refer to the main database and the database used for
temporary tables. The main and temp databases cannot be attached or
detached.

Tables in an attached database can be referred to using the syntax
*schema-name.table-name*. If the name of the table is unique
across all attached databases and the main and temp databases, then the
*schema-name* prefix is not required. If two or more tables in
different databases have the same name and the
*schema-name* prefix is not used on a table reference, then the
table chosen is the one in the database that was least recently attached.

Transactions involving multiple attached databases are atomic,
assuming that the main database is not "[:memory:](inmemorydb.html)" and the
[journal\_mode](pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode) is not [WAL](wal.html). If the main
database is ":memory:" or if the journal\_mode is WAL, then
transactions continue to be atomic within each individual
database file. But if the host computer crashes in the middle
of a [COMMIT](lang_transaction.html) where two or more database files are updated,
some of those files might get the changes where others
might not.

There is a limit, set using [sqlite3\_limit()](c3ref/limit.html) and
[SQLITE\_LIMIT\_ATTACHED](c3ref/c_limit_attached.html#sqlitelimitattached), to the number of databases that can be
simultaneously attached to a single database connection.
