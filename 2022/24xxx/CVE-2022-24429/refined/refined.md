    "CVE-2022-24429": {
      "root_cause": "The `convert-svg-core` package did not properly sanitize SVG input, allowing for the injection of malicious code through attributes like `onload` and `onfocus`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary code injection via SVG attributes",
        "Insufficient sanitization of user-provided SVG input",
