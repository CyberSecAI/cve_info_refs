The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `$id` parameter in `/admin/link/link_ok.php` is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `link_ok.php` file. The code directly incorporates the user-supplied `$id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL queries to:
*   Gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   Read, modify, or delete sensitive data.
*   Potentially take control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability can be triggered through HTTP GET requests to `link_ok.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter.
*   An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter when the `act` parameter is set to `del`, `mod`, or potentially `add` by manipulating the other parameters also.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server where the vulnerable application is running.
*   They must know the path to the vulnerable script (`/admin/link/link_ok.php`).
*   They likely would need to be logged into the administrative panel to access the vulnerable functionality.
