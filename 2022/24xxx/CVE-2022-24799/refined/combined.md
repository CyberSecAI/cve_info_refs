# Cross Site Scripting in Wire Messages

Critical

[comawill](/comawill)
published
GHSA-5568-rfh8-vmhq
Apr 20, 2022

## Package

wire-webapp
(wire)

## Affected versions

< 2022-03-30-production.0

## Patched versions

2022-03-30-production.0

## Description

### Impact

Insufficient escaping in markdown ‚Äúcode highlighting‚Äù in the wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript.

If a user receives and views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account.

Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack.

### Patches

* The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-03-30-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services.
* On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag **2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552** or wire-server **2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0)**, so that their applications are no longer affected.

### Workarounds

* No workarounds known

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
