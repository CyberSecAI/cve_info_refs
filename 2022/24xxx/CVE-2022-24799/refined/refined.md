Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-24799:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient escaping in markdown "code highlighting" within the wire-webapp.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of user-supplied code snippets in markdown.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary HTML code and JavaScript can be injected and executed within the context of the victim's browser when they view a malicious message.
- This allows an attacker to potentially gain full control of the user's account.
- Wire-desktop clients connected to vulnerable wire-webapp versions are also susceptible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack. An attacker crafts a malicious message containing a specific markdown code block.
- The message is sent to a victim user.
- When the user views the malicious message within the vulnerable wire-webapp, the embedded code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the victim user within the wire-webapp.
- User interaction is required because the victim needs to view the message.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in wire-webapp version 2022-03-30-production.0 and subsequent versions.
- On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 or wire-server 2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0).
- No known workarounds are available other than patching.
