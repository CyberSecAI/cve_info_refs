Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24792:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of WAV file data chunk lengths, specifically when the length exceeds a 31-bit integer. This can occur while reading WAV or AVI files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer Overflow: When reading a WAV file, the chunk size (`ch.len`) is read as a 32 bit unsigned integer. In certain parts of the code, this value is converted to a signed long or a signed offset which may cause an overflow if the unsigned 32 bit integer is greater than `PJ_MAXLONG`.
- Lack of Bounds Checking: The code didn't properly validate the size of data chunks in WAV and AVI files, particularly on 32-bit systems. It allowed operations using the chunk size which might overflow and cause out-of-bounds reads or infinite loops.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The primary impact is a denial-of-service. A specially crafted WAV or AVI file with an oversized chunk length can cause the application to enter an infinite loop or other erroneous behavior, preventing it from functioning correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious WAV/AVI File: An attacker could exploit this by providing a crafted WAV or AVI file containing a chunk with a length exceeding 31-bits.
- File I/O Operations: Direct use of PJLIB API `pj_file_*()` with parameters that cause an integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted media file to the vulnerable application, or control over the parameters passed to the pj_file_*() API.
- The attacker doesn't need to be local to the machine, as the vulnerability can be triggered remotely by processing a maliciously crafted media file.
- The vulnerability is specific to 32 bit systems, as 64 bit system is not vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability primarily affects applications running on 32-bit systems. 64-bit applications are not affected due to the larger data type used for offsets.
- The vulnerability exists in pjproject, a multimedia communication library, and can affect applications that use the library for media playback, such as Asterisk.
- Patches have been made to address this issue by adding checks for integer overflows when handling chunk sizes.
- The fix includes adding the `PJ_CHECK_OVERFLOW_UINT32_TO_LONG` macro to check if the uint32 var will overflow when converted to long.
- The `pj_file_setpos()` function is modified to validate the offset values passed to it.
- Affected versions are `2.12` or lower, and fixed in `2.12.1` or later.
