Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input to the `redirect.link` property when passed as an argument to the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the ability to inject malicious scripts into the `redirect.link` property, which is then rendered in the user's browser, potentially leading to XSS attacks.
- Improper Input Handling: The code fails to sanitize or encode the `redirect.link` value before using it within the HTML template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious Script Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they load a page built using the vulnerable code.
- Session Hijacking: Exploiting this vulnerability could potentially lead to session hijacking, where an attacker steals user session tokens.
- Data Theft: Malicious scripts may steal sensitive data from the user, such as cookies or local storage.
- Defacement: An attacker could alter the content of a webpage, leading to visual defacement of the application.
- Redirection: The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Untrusted Input: The attack vector is through providing malicious input to the `redirect.link` property. This input is then processed by the `build(MessagePageOptions)` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control the `redirect.link` input: The attacker needs the ability to provide untrusted/malicious input as the value for the `redirect.link` property when calling the vulnerable function.
- No authentication or authorization bypass is mentioned in the provided content, so this vulnerability may be exploitable without prior access.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of `@finastra/ssr-pages` prior to 0.1.5.
- The fix implemented involves encoding the `redirect.link` value using a custom `stringEncode` function before it's used within the template, specifically by converting characters to their unicode representation.
- The fix was introduced in commit `133606ffaec2edd9918d9fba5771ed21da7876a5` and merged into the master branch via pull request #2.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity.
