The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the `add_post.php` and `functions.php` files of a web application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `get_post_for_editing()` function in `functions.php` and in the `INSERT` query in `add_post.php`. Specifically, the `$_GET['page']` and `$_POST` parameters are used directly in SQL queries without proper escaping or prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because the `post_id` parameter from `$_GET['page']` and various parameters from `$_POST` are directly concatenated into SQL queries within `functions.php` and `add_post.php` respectively. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker could modify or delete existing data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** It might be possible to elevate privileges if the database user has sufficient permissions.
*   **Application Disruption:** The attacker could potentially disrupt the application by injecting malicious SQL queries that cause errors or crashes.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious URLs that include SQL injection payloads in the `page` parameter.
*   The POST parameters in `add_post.php` are also vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, specifically to `admin/add_post.php`.
*   The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The file `functions.php` contains the function `get_post_for_editing()`, which retrieves data from the `posts` table based on the provided `post_id`. The code uses direct concatenation:
```php
$query = " SELECT * FROM posts ";
$query .= " WHERE id =" . $post_id . " ";
```
The file `add_post.php` also uses direct concatenation in an `INSERT` statement:
```php
 $query = "INSERT INTO posts (page_id, title, active, position, content) VALUES ('{$page_id}', '{$title}', '{$active}', '{$position}', '{$content}')";
```
Because the `$post_id` parameter, as well as the POST parameters in `add_post.php` are not sanitized before being used in the SQL query, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `page` parameter in the URL or via the POST request to `add_post.php`.
For example, an attacker could craft a URL like:

`http://xx.xx.com/admin/add_post.php?page=2 and 1=1`

or

`http://xx.xx.com/admin/add_post.php?page=2 RLIKE SLEEP(2)`

to test for the SQL injection vulnerability and potentially extract data or perform other malicious actions.
