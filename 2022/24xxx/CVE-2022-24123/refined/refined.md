Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24123:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-provided input within a mermaid code block in MarkText. Specifically, the application did not sanitize the HTML content within the mermaid code block before rendering it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a mutation XSS. The application attempts to parse the content within the mermaid block as HTML, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Because of the XSS vulnerability, it can be escalated to RCE by using JavaScript to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
-  **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can take control of the application, potentially leading to data theft, modification or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Markdown File:** An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file containing a mermaid code block with embedded XSS payload.
- **Application rendering:** When the vulnerable version of MarkText renders the markdown file, the malicious HTML/JavaScript is executed, leading to RCE on the victim's machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create or modify a markdown file (.md file):** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a markdown file that will be opened with MarkText by the victim.
- **Target user running a vulnerable version of the MarkText application:** The victim must use a vulnerable version of MarkText to render the malicious markdown file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified in MarkText version v0.16.3 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in pull request #2947 which was merged. The fix involves sanitizing HTML before passing it to mermaid.js.
- The vulnerability has a critical severity rating and a EPSS score of 0.263%
