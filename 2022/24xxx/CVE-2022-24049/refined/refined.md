- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a stack-based buffer within the ALAC audio codec.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected Sonos One Speaker.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote, network-based attack. No authentication is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote. They need to send crafted data to the affected device, exploiting the vulnerable ALAC audio codec.
