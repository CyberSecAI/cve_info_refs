Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-24124:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the query API of Casdoor.
- The application uses user-supplied input (`field` and `value` parameters) to construct a raw SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to the vulnerability. Specifically, the `field` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL `LIKE` clause.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or use parameterized queries when incorporating user-provided input into SQL statements. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- The vulnerable code snippet is: `session = session.And(fmt.Sprintf("%s like ?", util.SnakeString(field)), fmt.Sprintf("%%%s%%", value))`

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality:**  An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, including user information, system configurations, and other valuable assets.  The provided PoC demonstrates the ability to extract the database user name using a SQL injection payload.
- **Integrity:** Although the provided content focuses on data extraction, SQL injection vulnerabilities can also be used to modify or delete data in the database, leading to a loss of data integrity.  However, the provided CVSS metrics state that integrity and availability are not impacted.
- **Availability:** While not directly mentioned in the provided exploit examples, in some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can also be used to disrupt the availability of the application. However the provided CVSS metrics state that availability is not impacted.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed through the network via the application's API endpoints.
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is through crafting malicious HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable API endpoints (`/api/get-organizations`).
- The specific vulnerable parameters are the `field` and `value` parameters within the API request.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any specific user privileges to exploit the vulnerability. The API endpoint `/api/get-organizations` is publicly accessible.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests to manipulate the `field` and `value` parameters in the request URL.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Casdoor instance.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable API:** `/api/get-organizations`
- **Vulnerable Parameters:** `field`, `value`
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
   ```
   https://door.casbin.com/api/get-organizations?p=1&pageSize=10&value=e99nb&sortField=&sortOrder=&field=(updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20user()),0x7e),1))%20%20and%20name
   ```
- **Initial Mitigation:** A blacklist was initially implemented, but was found to be bypassable using boolean based blind SQL injection techniques.
- **Final Fix:** The final fix uses a whitelist approach which allows only valid field names, effectively preventing the execution of arbitrary SQL functions. The field is validated to only consist of upper and lower case letters and numbers.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by user `wuhan005`.
- The fix was implemented in pull request [#442](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/pull/442) and released in version 1.13.1.
- The issue was tracked as issue [#439](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/439).
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-24124 and GHSA-m358-g4rp-533r
