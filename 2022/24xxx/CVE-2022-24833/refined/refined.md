The provided content is related to CVE-2022-24833.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the fact that SVG files can contain JavaScript which can be executed when the SVG is opened directly by a user in a browser tab and the instance is not protected by an adequate content security policy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper sanitization of SVG content before displaying it as a preview.
- Lack of a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent execution of scripts from untrusted sources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the PrivateBin instance's domain.
- This can lead to potential cookie theft or access to local storage data within the same origin if other services run in the same domain as the PrivateBin instance.
- While the exploit is limited due to the new tab context and does not allow direct access to paste content or encryption keys, it can still pose a security risk, depending on other services within the same domain.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a crafted SVG file as an attachment.
- Tricking a user into opening the preview image of the SVG in a new tab.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to upload an attachment to a PrivateBin instance.
- The attacker must rely on the victim to interact with the preview to trigger the vulnerability.
- The targeted PrivateBin instance must not have a correctly configured CSP.
