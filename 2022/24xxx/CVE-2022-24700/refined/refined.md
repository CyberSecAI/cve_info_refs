The provided content discusses a research project focused on finding vulnerabilities in ham radio software, specifically targeting WinAPRS. Although the document does not provide explicit CVE details, it does outline the methodology used by the researcher to discover a vulnerability. 

Based on the information provided:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The research is focused on identifying memory corruption vulnerabilities in older, unmaintained software. Specifically, the researcher targets the WinAPRS software.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The blog post indicates a focus on identifying exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities within the WinAPRS software. The researcher highlights that the software hasn't been updated since 2013, suggesting a high likelihood of such vulnerabilities. 
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The goal of the research is to achieve remote code or command execution, leading to the ability to gain a remote shell over ham radio.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the airwaves using packet radio communication and the AX.25 protocol, specifically via the APRS protocol which runs on top of AX.25. The exploit will likely involve crafting malicious data within the APRS information field, which will then be processed by vulnerable WinAPRS software. The data is transmitted via a TNC (Terminal Node Controller) and a radio transceiver.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to transmit data using amateur radio equipment compatible with the AX.25 protocol, be within range of the target or utilize digipeaters or IGate systems to reach target systems. The attacker also needs to be capable of developing exploits.
