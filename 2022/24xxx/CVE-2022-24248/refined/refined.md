{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper input sanitization when handling the 'delete' parameter in the file manager.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary File Deletion: The application allows authenticated users to delete arbitrary files on the server through the file manager by manipulating the 'delete' parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete any file in the web root or any other file on the server that the PHP process user has permissions to delete. This could lead to data loss, application malfunction, or circumvention of security mechanisms by deleting files like .htaccess.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface, specifically the file manager component.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the admin panel and the file manager. They also need the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests."
