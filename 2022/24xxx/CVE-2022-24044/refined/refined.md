- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The login functionality of the application lacks countermeasures against password spraying or credential stuffing attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application does not restrict excessive authentication attempts, allowing attackers to try numerous login attempts without triggering any security measures.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability, combined with information gained from CVE-2022-24043, to potentially gain unauthorized access to user accounts by successfully performing password spraying or credential stuffing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack can be performed remotely via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to perform this attack and can exploit this weakness from a network-connected position.
