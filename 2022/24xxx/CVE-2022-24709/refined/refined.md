Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24709:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is inadequate neutralization of content rendered by certain components within the `@awsui/components-react` library. This means the components did not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data before displaying it in the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High - Attackers can potentially access sensitive information within the application.
- **Integrity Impact:** High - Attackers can modify the content and behavior of the web application, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing credentials, or performing other harmful actions.
- **Availability Impact:** High -  Attackers might disrupt the normal functioning of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, implying the attacker does not require local access.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction to be triggered, which typically involves a user visiting a page with the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** Attackers do not need elevated privileges within the system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered to have low complexity meaning it's relatively easy to carry out.

**Summary of the vulnerability:**
The `@awsui/components-react` library versions prior to 3.0.367 are susceptible to XSS attacks. This is due to vulnerable components rendering content without proper sanitization, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts when a user interacts with the application. The impact is considered high due to possible data breaches, integrity compromise and denial of service. The attacker does not need any privileges or complex setup to inject the malicious content and trigger the vulnerability when a user views the altered page. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.0.367.

**Additional Information:**
- The CVSS score is 8.8, which is considered a high severity.
- The affected package is `@awsui/components-react`
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-79 which represents Cross-site Scripting.
