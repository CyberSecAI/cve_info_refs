# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# AWS-UI becomes Cloudscape Design System

On July 19th, 2022, we launched [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design). Cloudscape is an evolution of AWS-UI. It consists of user interface guidelines, front-end components, design resources, and development tools for building intuitive, engaging, and inclusive user experiences at scale. As part of the release, we have begun to publish npm packages to the new `@cloudscape-design` namespace.

**We recommend migrating your existing AWS-UI applications to *[Cloudscape](https://cloudscape.design)*.**

For more information, see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws/awsui-documentation).

## @awsui/components-react

[AWS UI](https://github.com/aws/awsui-documentation) is a collection of [React](https://reactjs.org/) components that help create intuitive,
responsive, and accessible user experiences for web applications. It is developed by [Amazon Web
Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). This work is available under the terms of the
[Apache 2.0 open source license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

This package provides AWS UI React components and can be used in conjunction with
[@awsui/collection-hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40awsui/collection-hooks),
[@awsui/design-tokens](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40awsui/design-tokens),
[@awsui/global-styles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40awsui/global-styles),
and [@awsui/test-utils-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40awsui/test-utils-core).

This release allows Amazon teams to release open source products that have a dependency on the
AWS UI components. It is just the first step in a larger process of creating a new open source
design system. You can find [more information on GitHub](https://github.com/aws/awsui-documentation).
