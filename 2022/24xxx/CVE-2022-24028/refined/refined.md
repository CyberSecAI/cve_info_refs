Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2022-24028:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the `GetValue` function within `libcommonprod.so`. This function is used to retrieve configuration values from flash memory. The function does not validate the size of the destination buffer before copying data, leading to potential overflows.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is the lack of bounds checking when copying data from flash memory using the `GetValue` function into a fixed-size buffer on the stack.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `GetValue` function does not account for the size of the destination buffer when copying data, and the called function `strncpy` uses the length of the source string instead of the destination buffer size.
    *  **Reliance on `strlen` for destination buffer size**: The `strncpy` used to copy data into the output buffer uses the `strlen` of the source buffer rather than the actual size of the destination buffer, thus allowing the buffer overflow when the source exceeds the destination's size.
    *   **Reused Code with Multiple Vulnerable Instances:** The `GetValue` function, along with the vulnerable pattern, is replicated across numerous binaries and libraries within the firmware.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite the return address on the stack, redirecting the execution flow to attacker-controlled code. This could lead to full control over the device.
    *   **Denial of Service:** The overflow could potentially cause the device to crash or become unstable.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** In some instances, a successful exploit could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely through a specially crafted protobuf message. The application uses protobuf messages to communicate configuration values, which then trigger the vulnerable function.
    *   **Local Exploitation:** The vulnerability can also be triggered locally using the command-line utility `cfm`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** An attacker must have network access to the device in order to send the specially crafted protobuf messages to trigger the vulnerability remotely.
    *   **Local Access (Alternative):** Local access to the device would also allow an attacker to use the `cfm` utility to set up the vulnerable condition.
    *   **Configuration Modification:** The attacker must have the ability to modify configuration values which are stored in flash memory. This likely requires some level of authentication or access to the device's management interface.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided report highlights that multiple binaries are affected by the same underlying issue, due to the shared use of the `GetValue` function without proper bounds checking.
*   The report mentions that although there is a single CVE for each affected binary, the vulnerability should actually have 1874 CVEs to reflect the multiple places the vulnerability occurs. This is due to the `GetValue` prototype not having size checking or the output buffers being too small.
*   The report includes specific examples in `confctl_set_app_language` as one of the locations where the vulnerability can be triggered and also demonstrates the call chain that results in the final vulnerable `strncpy`.

This vulnerability affects the `libcommonprod.so` library in the TCL LinkHub Mesh Wifi MS1G\_00\_01.00\_14, and allows remote attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution by overflowing the stack using a crafted configuration value.
