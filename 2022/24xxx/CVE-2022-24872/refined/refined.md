Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24872:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the Shopware platform's `SalesChannelContext/Cart` functionality. Specifically, permissions set via the admin API for a sales channel context were not properly cleared or ignored when a normal user session was initiated. This means that a user could potentially inherit elevated permissions intended only for administrative contexts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The core issue is the failure to restrict access based on the user's session type, leading to the user being able to potentially obtain higher level access within the system.
- **Permission persistence:** Permissions set via the admin API were not being cleared or ignored during the creation of a new user sales channel context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities within the Shopware platform, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized actions, or other malicious behavior. The impact is rated as "High".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the way Shopware manages permissions within the sales channel context.
- An attacker could potentially leverage permissions set by an admin to gain access to functionalities they would otherwise not be able to access through the normal user-facing web storefront.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have an account within the system with which to start a normal user session.
- The attacker would also rely on the existence of permissions set via the admin API on the same sales channel context that the attacker is using.
- No further capabilities or specific positioning is mentioned in the available content.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Shopware version 6.4.10.1.
- Patches are available as plugins for older versions (6.1, 6.2, and 6.3) but it is strongly recommended to update to the latest Shopware version for full functionality.
- The vulnerability is identified as `GHSA-9wrv-g75h-8ccc`.
- The vulnerability is located in the `shopware/platform` and `shopware/core` packages.
- The specific code changes related to this vulnerability are in the commit `083765e2d64a00315050c4891800c9e98ba0c77c`. The changed files are: `src/Core/Framework/Api/Controller/SalesChannelProxyController.php`, `src/Core/System/SalesChannel/Context/CartRestorer.php`, `src/Core/System/SalesChannel/Context/SalesChannelContextPersister.php`, and `src/Core/System/Test/SalesChannel/Context/CartRestorerTest.php`.
- Specifically, the changes made ensure that permissions are not restored when a customer context is created.
