The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-24980.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A missing access check in an eID script of the "Kitodo.Presentation" TYPO3 extension allows unauthenticated users to submit arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to the lack of access controls on URL submissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can submit arbitrary URLs, causing the server to make requests to internal resources, files, or external websites that the server has access to. This allows the attacker to view the content of these resources.

**Attack vectors:**
An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted request with an arbitrary URL to the vulnerable eID script of the "Kitodo.Presentation" extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable TYPO3 instance. No authentication is required.
