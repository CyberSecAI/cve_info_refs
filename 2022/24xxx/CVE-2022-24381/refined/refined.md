- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing limitation on the number of received chunks per single session or in total for all concurrent sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) due to the lack of a mechanism to limit the number of received chunks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending an unlimited number of huge chunks, leading to resource exhaustion and making the system unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an unlimited number of huge chunks (e.g., 2GB each) without sending the final closing chunk via the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can perform this attack remotely over the network with no special access or privileges required.
