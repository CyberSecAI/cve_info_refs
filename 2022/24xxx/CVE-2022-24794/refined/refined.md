Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-24794:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `requiresAuth` middleware in the `express-openid-connect` library not properly sanitizing the `req.originalUrl` property when used as a redirect URL after login. Specifically, it does not handle multiple leading slashes in the URL, which could be exploited to redirect users to untrusted sites.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect (CWE-601). The middleware uses the potentially attacker-controlled `req.originalUrl` as the `returnTo` parameter in the authentication flow, without proper validation or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Attackers can craft URLs with leading slashes (e.g., `http://example.com//google.com`) that, after authentication, will redirect users to an attacker-controlled domain (e.g., `google.com` in this example) instead of the intended application URL.
- **Phishing Attacks:** This can be used in phishing attacks by redirecting users to fake login pages or other malicious sites.
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal user credentials by redirecting them to a fake login page that looks identical to the legitimate login page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers craft a malicious URL with multiple leading slashes and trick users into visiting it.
- **Catch-All Route:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `requiresAuth` middleware is applied to a catch-all route.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make a user visit a URL on the vulnerable application with the attacker's crafted URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented in version 2.7.2 involves collapsing multiple leading slashes in `req.originalUrl` to a single slash before using it as a redirect.
- This issue affects users using the `requiresAuth` middleware on a catch-all route, or the default `authRequired` option with `express-openid-connect` versions <= 2.7.1.
- The provided commit diff shows the code change to collapse the leading slashes in `lib/context.js` and a test case was added to `test/requiresAuth.tests.js` to verify the fix.
