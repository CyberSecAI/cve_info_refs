# URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in express-openid-connect

Moderate

[adamjmcgrath](/adamjmcgrath)
published
GHSA-7p99-3798-f85c
Mar 29, 2022

## Package

npm

express-openid-connect
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=2.7.1

## Patched versions

2.7.2

## Description

### Impact

Users of the `requiresAuth` middleware, either directly or through the default `authRequired` option, are vulnerable to an Open Redirect when the middleware is applied to a catch all route.

If all routes under `example.com` are protected with the `requiresAuth` middleware, a visit to `http://example.com//google.com` will be redirected to `google.com` after login because the original url reported by the Express framework is not properly sanitised.

### Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using the `requiresAuth` middleware on a catch all route or the default `authRequired` option and `express-openid-connect` version `<=2.7.1`.

### How to fix that?

Upgrade to version `>=2.7.2`

### Will this update impact my users?

The fix provided in the patch will not affect your users.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24794

### Weaknesses

[CWE-601](/advisories?query=cwe%3A601)
