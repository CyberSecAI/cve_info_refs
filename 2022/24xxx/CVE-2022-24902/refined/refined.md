Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `tkVideoPlayer` library handled video frames. It was loading all frames into memory, leading to excessive memory consumption, even when playing small video files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak/Excessive Memory Usage:** The primary vulnerability is the uncontrolled memory allocation due to storing all video frames in memory. This caused the application's memory footprint to grow rapidly, even for short videos.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By playing a video, a user could cause the application to consume excessive memory, potentially leading to a crash or making the system unresponsive.
- **Performance Degradation:** The excessive memory usage could also lead to general performance degradation of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Playing any video file with the vulnerable version of the `tkVideoPlayer` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker only needs to be a user of an application using a vulnerable version of `tkVideoPlayer` or have the ability to supply a video file to such an application.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was reported on GitHub as issue #3.
- User reports indicated memory usage exceeding 1GB for 8MB files and 3GB for 1.9MB files.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.0, which implemented a new method of reading frames from disk on demand instead of pre-loading them into memory.
