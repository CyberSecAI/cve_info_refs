{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application's caching mechanism did not properly differentiate between requests from regular users and crawlers, leading to potential cache poisoning.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper cache key generation leading to cache pollution."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can poison the cache for anonymous users, causing them to see the crawler view of the site instead of the regular HTML page, resulting in a partial denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a specially crafted request that is identified as a crawler request, the attacker can force the server to cache the crawler view of the page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server."

    "affected_versions": "stable <= 2.8.2; beta <= 2.9.0.beta3; tests-passed <= 2.9.0.beta3",
    "patched_versions": "stable >= 2.8.3; beta >= 2.9.0.beta4; tests-passed >= 2.9.0.beta4",
    "fix_details": "The fix ensures that user-agent-based responses are cached separately, preventing the mixing of responses intended for crawlers with those for regular users. This is done by adding a check for old browsers in the cache key generation."
