# Anonymous user cache poisoning via maliciously formed request

High

[pmusaraj](/pmusaraj)
published
GHSA-46v9-3jc4-f53w
Apr 14, 2022

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.8.2; beta <= 2.9.0.beta3; tests-passed <= 2.9.0.beta3

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.8.3; beta >= 2.9.0.beta4; tests-passed >= 2.9.0.beta4

## Description

### Impact

An attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e. not logged in) users, such that the users are shown the crawler view of the site instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial denial-of-service.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24824

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
