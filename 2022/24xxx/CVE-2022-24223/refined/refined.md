Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the `$_POST['email']` and `$_POST['password']` variables are directly inserted into the SQL query string within the `/admin/login.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious code through the `email` and/or `password` fields.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login authentication mechanism by injecting SQL code that always evaluates to true (e.g., `email=alan@alan.com'or '1'='1&password=123`). This allows unauthorized access to the administrative panel of the system.
*   **Data Breach:** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided content, a successful SQL injection can lead to data breaches, allowing the attacker to access, modify, or delete data stored in the database, if the user has sufficient database privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by submitting a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin/login.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Input:** The malicious payload is embedded within the `email` and/or `password` parameters of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the affected `/admin/login.php` page.
*   The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges and can be unauthenticated.
*   The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a suitable injection payload.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided code snippets in the comments suggest a mitigation using PDO (PHP Data Objects) with prepared statements and parameter binding to prevent SQL injection.
* It should also be noted that the provided code sample also does not properly handle the password storage and performs the check with `password_verify`.
* The issue was marked as resolved in the branch "AtomCMS-2.1"
