Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-24042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The web application does not properly expire the AuthToken at the defined auto logoff delay timeout. This means that the token remains valid for longer than intended, even after the user should be logged out.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613):** The core issue is the lack of proper session management where the AuthToken doesn't expire as it should.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker who can capture the AuthToken can reuse it to impersonate a legitimate user. This allows them to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application, potentially accessing sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Sniffing/Interception:** The attacker could intercept the AuthToken during communication between the client and the server. This could be done through a man-in-the-middle attack.
-  **Token Reuse:** An attacker can use a captured token to access the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to capture the AuthToken, either by network interception or some other means of gaining access to it. They do not need any authentication or privilege to take advantage of this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The CVSS score is 5.3, categorized as Medium.
- The attack does not require any user interaction (UI:N).
- This vulnerability affects Desigo PXC and DXR devices as mentioned in the advisory.
