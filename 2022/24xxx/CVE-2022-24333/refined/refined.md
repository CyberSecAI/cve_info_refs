Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24333:

**CVE-2022-24333**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) that occurs via an XML-RPC call in JetBrains TeamCity.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or sanitization in the XML-RPC call processing, allowing an attacker to craft a request that triggers a server-side request to an arbitrary URL. This lack of control over the request destination is the root of the SSRF.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact of this SSRF vulnerability is significant. An attacker could potentially leverage it to:
    *   Scan internal networks.
    *   Access internal services or resources that are not publicly accessible.
    *   Potentially read data from internal services.
    *   Potentially perform actions on internal services, depending on the service accessed.
    *   Potentially exfiltrate data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is an XML-RPC call to the TeamCity server. An attacker would need to send a malicious XML-RPC request that includes a URL or hostname they want to access on the server's network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to send requests to the TeamCity server's XML-RPC endpoint. This could mean the attacker is on the same network as the server, or has network access to it. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

The information extracted from the provided document aligns with the general description of an SSRF vulnerability, and it specifies that the vulnerability was resolved in TeamCity version 2021.2.
