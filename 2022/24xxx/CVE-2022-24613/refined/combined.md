| 1. Unique Bugs Found Recently we ([Zhang Cen](https://github.com/occia), [Huang Wenjie](https://github.com/ZanderHuang) and [Zhang Xiaohan](https://github.com/Han0nly)) discovered a series of bugs in latest metadta-extractor (2.16.0). Every bug we reported in the following is unique and reproducable. We sorted and refined them from thousands of crashes. Furthermore, they have been manually analyzed and triaged in removing the duplicates. Due to the lack of contextual knowledge in the metadta-extractor library, we cannot thoroughly fix some bugs hence we look forward to any proposed plan from the developers in fixing these bugs. 2. Bug Report and Crash Seeds The bug report folder can be downloaded from <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17UpSofkqh1KV1L5yGWzRFOT37LAJgliM?usp=sharing> It contains both reports and crash seeds. 3. Test Program to Reproduce Crashes The test program can be downloaded from <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TfMaxAUyjuQIwXfQzHT-xUN7f25piqWt/view?usp=sharing>  Total 33 bugs are reported in this pull request. A full list is provided below. 4. Folder Structure  * Level 1 (folder): exception type * Level 2 (folder): error location * Level 3 (files): POC file and **report.txt** including reproducing steps  5. report.txt content:  1.

| Thank you for sharing these.  Are you willing and able to donate the repro images to the library's public regression test suite?  Most of these look like very simple fixes, just needing some additional tests on value ranges. We would welcome pull requests. |

| [@ZanderHuang](https://github.com/ZanderHuang) I am particularly interested in knowing the answer to:  Are you willing and able to donate the repro images to the library's public regression test suite?  Where did these images come from, and are you willing and able to make the public? We are careful to only add images to the test data set when consent is given. We use these images for regression testing, and they are very valuable in preventing regressions. |

| [@drewnoakes](https://github.com/drewnoakes) These bugs are classified into different exception and error types. In each folder, there is poc.tar.gz which contains all the poc files (images) for triggering that kind of bugs. <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17UpSofkqh1KV1L5yGWzRFOT37LAJgliM?usp=sharing>  For an example, this is from java.lang.ArithmeticException > com.drew.metadata.exif.PanasonicRawDistortionDescriptor.getDistortionScaleDescription--PanasonicRawDistortionDescriptor.java-97 ( <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jd7rbENrI6EG1FQZXExkh4f2RxQo6Lxb?usp=sharing> ) - download and unzip the poc.tar.gz in this link to get the poc image files. |

| Hi [@drewnoakes](https://github.com/drewnoakes) , I'm the collaborator of [@ZanderHuang](https://github.com/ZanderHuang). To some extent, we can say we created these images. The whole process for creating these inputs is as follows:   1. These images were originally gotten from GitHub fuzz corpus repositories, mostly from [this](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz-corpus). 2. We use a technique called Fuzzing to randomly mutate these samples and observe how the software performs. 3. For those samples that performed abnormally, we performed manual analysis and triaged these problems.   We are willing to donate the repro images to the library's public regression test suite. |

| were originally gotten from GitHub fuzz corpus ... randomly mutate these samples  Thanks for explaining. I am not 100% clear on whether these derived works are free from the original creator's constraints. I'll ask on their repo whether they are able to share them.  Any updates on these bugs?  I'm not sure what update you'd like. I think all users of and contributors to this library appreciate the effort here, but none have stepped up to submit fixes. I suspect most of these fixes would be very small and easy to make, so I've labelled this as a "good first issue". |

| The upstream project is Apache-2.0, so the fuzzed files seem appropriate for adding to <https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-images>, which would be the first step. We could then run the files, see the errors, and set about fixing them in both the Java and .NET implementations, as needed. |

| We had a [discussion](https://github.com/srikanth-lingala/zip4j/issues/377) several days before for the CVEs of DoS bugs of java libraries. We think applications built upon these java libraries can be vulnerable to DoS attacks. Hope this can be a reasonable explanation.  Thank you very much for pointing out your concern ([@snoopysecurity](https://github.com/snoopysecurity)), which indeed helps the community! |

| The current "trend" seems to be that almost any bug can be considered a "security issue" since they can somehow be used to degrade the application, via DoS for example. To me this is a very bad situation, where CVE's are approaching something useless that I will just ignore. It's a problem though, because among them there will be "real" issues.  I think a start would be to classify things somewhat, for example a lot of problems that are relevant for web services aren't relevant under other circumstances (DoS, SQL injection etc). These should then only apply to applications that does this.  The way it is now, everything is being "stained" with a lot of CVE's and there's almost a "panic-like attitude" among those that don't understand this game. I think the current direction is a dead-end, it won't solve security issues - on the contrary, it will make a lot of people to fed up to care at all. |

| I took a look into the OutOfMemory exceptions. Looks to have been the result of integer overflows. I've resolved some problems in SequentialByteArrayReader and StreamReader and opened a PR:  [#570](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/pull/570)  edit: also [#571](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/pull/571)  CC [@drewnoakes](https://github.com/drewnoakes) hopefully resolves CVE. |

| I worked through these issues over the weekend. I don't see how these could be considered vulnerabilities in any meaningful way though. If someone has an example of how any of these issues could be used maliciously, please let me know privately.  Still, fixing these allows partial metadata to be returned when an error is detected, which is a general goal for the language — one that escaping exceptions prevent.  Thanks for the work here. I'll close this out now. |
