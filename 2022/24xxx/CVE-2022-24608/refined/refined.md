Root cause of vulnerability:
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering category names, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the "name" field in the category modification form is vulnerable.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Stored XSS: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the category name field and stored in the database, which is then executed when the category list is displayed.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize or encode the user-supplied input before displaying it, allowing the injected script to be executed in the user's browser.

Impact of exploitation:
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when viewing the category list.
- Account compromise: The attacker could potentially steal cookies or session tokens, leading to account compromise.
- Defacement: The attacker could modify the content displayed on the page.
- Malicious redirects: The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

Attack vectors:
- HTTP request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `/admin/news/sort_mod.php` endpoint.
- User input: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the "name" field of the category modification form.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be authenticated into the admin panel of the application.
- Access to the category modification form: The attacker needs to be able to access the form at `/admin/news/sort_mod.php` and have permission to modify categories.
