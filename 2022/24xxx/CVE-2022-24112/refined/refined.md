Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- A bug exists in the `batch-requests` plugin of Apache APISIX that allows an attacker to bypass a check meant to override the client IP with the real remote IP. This bypass is achieved through manipulation of the `X-REAL-IP` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **IP Restriction Bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass IP-based access controls on the Admin API.
- **Header Overwrite:** The `batch-requests` plugin does not correctly handle and overwrite the `X-REAL-IP` header, allowing an attacker to spoof their IP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If a default configuration of Apache APISIX is used (with default API key), the IP restriction bypass leads to remote code execution.
- **Data Panel Access:** Even with a modified admin key or a different port for the Admin API, there is still a risk of bypassing the IP restrictions on Apache APISIX's data panel, leading to unauthorized access and potential data manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted request using the `batch-requests` plugin and manipulating the `X-REAL-IP` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Apache APISIX instance where the vulnerable `batch-requests` plugin is enabled.
- No specific privileged access to the system or to the Apache APISIX configuration is explicitly mentioned other than the ability to send requests, but the impact is much greater with default admin credentials

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered "high" severity.
- Mitigation involves either disabling the `batch-requests` plugin or upgrading to a patched version (2.10.4 or 2.12.1).
- The vulnerability was initially discovered by Real World CTF at Chaitin Tech and reported by Sauercloud.
