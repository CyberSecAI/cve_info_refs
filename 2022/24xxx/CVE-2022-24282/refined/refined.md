Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2022-24282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of user-supplied JSON objects, which are then deserialized into Java objects by the affected software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure deserialization of untrusted data. Specifically, the software does not properly validate or sanitize the serialized Java objects before deserializing them. This is classified as CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- An attacker sends a maliciously crafted serialized Java object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be privileged (PR:H). This implies the attacker needs to have some level of authorized access before exploiting the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any user interaction (UI:N) to trigger the vulnerability.
