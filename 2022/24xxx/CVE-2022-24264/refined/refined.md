Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24264:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/administrator/components/table_manager/` component of CuppaCMS. Specifically, the `search_word` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input (`search_word` parameter) into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data disclosure: Accessing sensitive information, including usernames and passwords, stored in the database.
    - Data modification: Altering or deleting data.
    - Complete system compromise: In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the database server or the application server if the database user has sufficient permission, leading to full compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a POST request to `/administrator/components/table_manager/` with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `search_word` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable component of the CuppaCMS application. Authentication may be required depending on the application's access control mechanism, though the provided content does not specify if the vulnerable endpoint requires authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit and example request and response demonstrating the SQL injection vulnerability. The POC payload is `search_word=') union all select concat('version:',version(),'<br>'),concat('database:',database(),'<br>'),group_concat('username:',username,'<br>','password:',password),4,5,6,7,8 from cu_users-- -`.
- The content also suggests using input filtering, escaping, and parameterized queries as mitigations.
