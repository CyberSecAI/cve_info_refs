High

[camertron](/camertron)
published
GHSA-cm9w-c4rj-r2cf
Mar 2, 2022

## Package

bundler

view\_component

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

Avoid passing user input to the `translate` function, or sanitize the inputs before passing them.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in the [github/view\_component](https://github.com/github/view_component) project
