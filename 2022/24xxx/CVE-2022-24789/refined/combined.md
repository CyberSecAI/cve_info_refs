# GHSL-2022-001: Deserialization of untrusted data allows for Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or arbitrary file truncation.

Moderate

[napernik](/napernik)
published
GHSA-j9c2-gr6m-pp45
Mar 28, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 6.12

## Patched versions

6.12

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability allows an authenticated user to:

* Exploit SSRF by making the server make arbitrary GET requests to other servers in the local network or on localhost.
* Truncate arbitrary files to zero size (effectively delete them) that may lead to denial of service (DoS) or altering application logic.

The authenticated user may perform the actions unknowingly by visiting a specially crafted site.

### Patches

Patched in C1 CMS v6.12

### Workarounds

Upgrade to C1 CMS v6.12 or newer is required

## Credit

This issue was discovered and reported by GHSL team member [@JarLob (Jaroslav Lobačevski)](https://github.com/JarLob).

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-24789

### Weaknesses

[CWE-502](/advisories?query=cwe%3A502)
