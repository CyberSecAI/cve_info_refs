{
  "CVE-2022-24761": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from two issues:\n\n1.  The use of Python's `int()` function to parse strings into integers without proper validation. This allows strings like `+10` or `0x01` to be parsed as `10` and `1` respectively, while the HTTP standard dictates that these strings should only contain digits or hex digits.\n2.  The server does not support chunk extensions but discards them without validating that they don't contain illegal characters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "HTTP Request Smuggling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to perform HTTP request smuggling or splitting. This occurs when the front-end proxy and Waitress disagree on where a request starts and ends, allowing an attacker to send malicious requests via the proxy to the Waitress server. This can lead to cache poisoning or unexpected information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP requests sent to a Waitress server behind a proxy. The requests contain invalid characters in the Content-Length header, chunk extensions, or chunk size.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server running Waitress behind a proxy. The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability to craft malicious requests that will be interpreted differently by the front-end proxy and the Waitress server."
