- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via the SLP protocol and can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the printer, and no authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
