{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `GetValue` function in TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi devices does not validate the size of the destination buffer when copying data from the flash configuration, leading to a buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) due to lack of bounds checking in `GetValue` function.",
     "Multiple instances of the vulnerable `GetValue` function across different binaries, with different destination buffers, but not matching the potential size of the source buffer."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution due to the ability to overwrite return addresses on the stack by providing an overly large configuration value to GetValue.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Modifying a configuration value through the `cfm` command-line utility.",
    "Modifying a configuration value remotely using protobuf messages similar to those used by the TCL phone application."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to modify configuration values on the device via CLI or remotely using protobuf messages."
