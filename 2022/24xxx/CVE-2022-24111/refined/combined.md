## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

### Bug Description

Portfolios should only be available to the selected people or groups of people who have been given access. This is the case for personal portfolios. However, a change introduced in Mahara 21.04 invalidated the permissions check for group, institution, and site portfolios.

To replicate:

Group:

1. Create a private group with the setting 'Publicly viewable group' set to 'No'.

2. Create a page within the group and copy the URL when the page is in 'Display' mode.

3. Open a private browser window and go to the copied URL.

Results:

- Expected: The site redirects to the login page.

- Actual: The private group page can be seen without logging in.

Institution:

1. Create an institution.

2. Create an institution page and do not share it with anybody.

3. Open a private browser window and go to the copied URL.

Results:

- Expected: The site redirects to the login page.

- Actual: The institution page can be seen without logging in.

Site:

1. Create a site page and do not share it with anybody.

2. Open a private browser window and go to the copied URL.

Results:

- Expected: The site redirects to the login page.

- Actual: The site page can be seen without logging in.
