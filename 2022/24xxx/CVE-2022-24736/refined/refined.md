Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information found in the provided content related to CVE-2022-24736:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - A specially crafted Lua script can cause a NULL pointer dereference within the redis-server process. This occurs when the server attempts to load the malformed script, leading to a crash.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - The vulnerability lies in how Redis handles specially crafted Lua scripts, leading to a null pointer dereference when trying to load or execute them.
   - Specifically, the issue stems from how Redis manages its Lua environment which allows injection of code that can run outside the intended scope, leading to the crash.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**
   - Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition because it crashes the redis-server process.

**4. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is the loading of a malformed Lua script. This can be done via the `SCRIPT LOAD` or `EVAL` commands.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - An attacker needs the ability to send commands to the Redis server.
   - They do not need any special privileges or a specific user account. They require a connection to the Redis instance and the ability to execute Lua scripts.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of Redis prior to the fix.
*   The fix involves adding support for readonly tables in Lua scripts, preventing them from modifying global tables that were previously being manipulated to perform privilege escalation and DoS attacks.
*   The fix prevents user code from running during the compile phase and moves the user code to a special table that is inaccessible from the user.
*   The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
*   The fix also involves restricting access to the `print()` function in Lua scripts due to potential server blocking issues. The recommendation is to use `redis.log` instead.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Aviv Yahav.
*   NetApp is aware of public discussion of this vulnerability and has published an advisory listing affected and non-affected products.
