- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Dell BIOS contains an information exposure vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure due to insufficient protection of debug interfaces.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with physical access and knowledge of the system configuration can read system information via debug interfaces. This could lead to a compromise of the affected system(s), with high impact on integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access to the system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be local, unauthenticated, have physical access to the system, and possess knowledge of the system configuration to exploit the debug interfaces.
