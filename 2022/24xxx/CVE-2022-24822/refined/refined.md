Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `@podium/proxy` package not properly handling the `Trailer` header in incoming HTTP requests. Specifically, it was forwarding the `Trailer` header to the destination server, which could lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `@podium/proxy` package was vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to improper handling of the `Trailer` header.
- The vulnerability existed in how the proxy handled HTTP headers, forwarding the `Trailer` header to the backend server which it shouldn't.
- This vulnerability was present in versions of `@podium/proxy` prior to `4.2.74` and versions of `@podium/layout` prior to `4.6.110` (which depends on `@podium/proxy`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to take down the server by sending a crafted request containing the `Trailer` header to proxy endpoints.
- All Podium layouts that include podlets with proxy endpoints were vulnerable.
- The impact is a denial of service of the affected application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through sending HTTP requests to proxy endpoints that include the `Trailer` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No specific authentication or special access is needed, as the vulnerability lies in handling of the `Trailer` header.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability in `@podium/proxy` involved removing the `Trailer` header from the incoming request before forwarding the request to the destination server.
- The vulnerability was reported by krynos from Ercoli Consulting via FINN.no's private bug bounty program.
- The affected packages are `@podium/layout` and `@podium/proxy`.
- The fix was released in `@podium/layout` version `4.6.110` and `@podium/proxy` version `4.2.74`.

**CWE:**
- CWE-248 is related to the vulnerability.
