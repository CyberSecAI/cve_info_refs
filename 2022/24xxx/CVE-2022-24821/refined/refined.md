Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect privilege check in XWiki's Skinx extension system. Specifically, the permission to add "always used" Skinx extensions (SSX/JSX) was checked against the content of the document being edited instead of the document's metadata author. This allowed a user with only edit rights to add global SSX/JSX by modifying a document that was previously created/modified by a user with programming rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The core issue is the flawed permission check, which mistakenly granted elevated privileges based on the content rather than the user's actual permissions.
*   **Improper Authorization:** Users without programming rights could inject global JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A standard user can inject arbitrary Javascript code that will be executed everywhere on the wiki.
*   **Impersonation Attacks:**  Malicious JavaScript could be used to perform actions with elevated privileges, essentially allowing impersonation.
*   **Loss of Integrity and Confidentiality:** Although the provided CVSS vector rates Integrity and Availability as "None," the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript can be used to compromise these. Data could be modified (Integrity), and exfiltrated (Confidentiality).
*   **Scope Change:** The injected code has a global scope, impacting all areas of the wiki.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be carried out over the network, likely through the web interface of the XWiki platform.
*   **Document Modification:** The attacker needs to edit an existing document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low privileges:** The attacker needs basic edit rights on the XWiki platform.
*   **User Interaction:** Some user interaction is required (the attacker must edit an existing document).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 6.8.
*   The affected versions are XWiki prior to 13.10RC1, 12.10.11, and 13.4.6. Patched versions are 13.10RC1, 12.10.11 and 13.4.6
*   The vulnerability is identified with CWE-648: Incorrect Privilege Assignment.
*   There is no easy workaround other than to upgrade.
