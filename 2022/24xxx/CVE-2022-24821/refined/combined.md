#### Description

The PR rights for adding an "always used" Skinx extension (be it SSX or JSX) is currently checked against the content of the document, instead of being checked against the metadata author. It means that any document with a content edited by a user with PR rights can be edited by a standard user to add a JSX that will be executed everywhere in the wiki.

Reproduction steps:

* Create a document with Admin user (who has PR rights)
* Login with a user with edit rights (no need for script rights)
* Edit the previously created document to add a Javascript object containing only console.log("Hello hello"); and set this object to be used on the whole wiki
* Log out and navigate

Expected result:

* the console log should not be output since the user doesn't have PR rights

Obtained result:

* the console log is displayed everywhere

# Incorrect Use of Privileged APIs in org.xwiki.platform.skin.skinx

Moderate

Apr 8, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform.skin.skinx
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 3.1M1

## Patched versions

13.10RC1, 12.10.11, 13.4.6

## Description

### Impact

Simple users can create global SSX/JSX without specific rights: in theory only users with Programming Rights should be allowed to create SSX or JSX that are executed everywhere on a wiki. But a bug allow anyone with edit rights to actually create those.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10-rc-1, 12.10.11 and 13.4.6.

### Workarounds

There's no easy workaround for this issue, administrators should upgrade their wiki.

### References

<https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19155>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
