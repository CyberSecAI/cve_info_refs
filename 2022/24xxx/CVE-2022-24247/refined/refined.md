Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `file_name` parameter during file upload in the file manager of RiteCMS. This allows an authenticated user to specify an arbitrary file path, leading to arbitrary file overwrite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to overwrite any file on the server accessible by the PHP process user.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability utilizes path traversal using `../` in the `file_name` parameter to navigate the directory structure and overwrite files outside the intended upload directory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the file path provided by the user in the `file_name` parameter, leading to this flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** An attacker could overwrite critical files such as `index.php` to execute arbitrary PHP code, potentially leading to complete control of the webserver.
- **Data Modification/Destruction:** An attacker can modify any file, including configuration files, scripts, and data files, leading to data loss, corruption, or website defacement.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If the PHP process runs with elevated privileges (e.g., root), an attacker could potentially modify system files such as `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/shadow`, escalating their privileges on the entire server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of the RiteCMS admin panel.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `file_name` parameter in a multipart/form-data HTTP POST request when uploading a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges in RiteCMS to access the file manager.
- **Web Browser:** An attacker requires a web browser or a tool to craft the HTTP request with the malicious `file_name` parameter.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the RiteCMS server.
