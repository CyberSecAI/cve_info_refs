The provided content is related to CVE-2022-24117.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the absence of cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of firmware downloads.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of integrity checks during firmware downloads (CWE-494).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to compromise the integrity of the device by installing malicious firmware, potentially leading to full control of the device or disruption of its operations.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, where the attacker leverages the lack of firmware integrity checks to inject malicious firmware during an update process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires high privileges on the network, and the victim has to initiate a firmware update. A successful attack requires user interaction.
