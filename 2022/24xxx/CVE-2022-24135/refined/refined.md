- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `search` parameter of multiple URL endpoints, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application directly renders user-supplied input within the HTML context without proper sanitization or encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's web pages, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection of users to malicious websites
    - Execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via the `search` parameter in the URL query string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript and trick a user into visiting the vulnerable page. This can be done via phishing, social engineering or by other means of URL distribution.
