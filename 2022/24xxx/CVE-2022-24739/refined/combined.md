# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')

High

[Rudloff](/Rudloff)
published
GHSA-75p7-527p-w8wp
Mar 8, 2022

## Package

composer

rudloff/alltube
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 3.0.3

## Patched versions

3.0.3

## Description

### Impact

On releases prior to 3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack (depending on how AllTube is configured).

The impact is mitigated by the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.)

### Patches

3.0.3 contains a fix for this vulnerability.

(The 1.x and 2.x releases are not maintained anymore.)

The fix requires applying [a patch](https://github.com/Rudloff/alltube/blob/3d092891044f2685ed66c73c870a021bee319c37/patches/youtube-dl-disable-generic.diff) to youtube-dl to disable its generic extractor. If you are using the version of youtube-dl bundled with 3.0.3, it is already patched.

However, if you are using your own unpatched version of youtube-dl **you might still be vulnerable**.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
