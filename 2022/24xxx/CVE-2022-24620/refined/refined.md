Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-24620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in Piwigo version 12.2.0.
- It stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input when adding or editing group names. Specifically, the application doesn't properly sanitize or encode the group name field before storing it in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS (CWE-79):** Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within the group name field and stored in the database. This payload is executed each time the affected page is loaded by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that, when executed in the browser of a webmaster user, can be used to steal the webmaster's session cookies. This stolen cookie allows the attacker to take over the webmaster's session, granting them full control over the Piwigo installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the "group name" field in the Piwigo admin panel.
- An authenticated user with admin privileges can inject malicious code, which will then be executed in the browser of another user viewing the affected page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Piwigo instance to be able to access the group name field.

**More Details than the CVE Description:**
- The provided content includes a detailed proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the stored XSS using the specific payload `<svg onload=alert(1)>`.
- The content explicitly mentions how an admin can potentially leverage the XSS to steal the webmaster's cookies and escalate privileges using a technique described in a linked resource: `https://github.com/R0B1NL1N/WebHacking101/blob/master/xss-reflected-steal-cookie.md`.
- The provided POST request example shows how the malicious code is injected via the `virtual_name` parameter.
- It also includes discussion by developers questioning the severity of the vulnerability and if the ability to embed javascript in album names or descriptions is considered a vulnerability.
