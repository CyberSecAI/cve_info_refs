### **[Sachinart](/Sachinart)** commented [Feb 2, 2022](#issue-1122294432)

| Hi, I found Stored XSS in Piwigo version 12.2.0 (Not tested older versions).  **Proof Of Concept**:   1. Add an admin through webmaster's access. 2. Through the admin account open <http://localhost/piwigo-12.2.0/piwigo/admin.php?page=cat_list> 3. Add < svg onload=alert(1)> (Remove space) in the group name field.   Can use any malicious JS code, Now you can see XSS will pop-up.  **Impact:**  In this way admin can easily takeover webmaster's access using [this technique](https://github.com/R0B1NL1N/WebHacking101/blob/master/xss-reflected-steal-cookie.md).  **Burp:**  ``` POST http://localhost/piwigo-12.2.0/piwigo/admin.php?page=cat_list Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,hi;q=0.8 Cache-Control: max-age=0 Connection: keep-alive Content-Length: 98 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: pwg_id=lq5gpi2eacbfhhp9ckm0i60ee0; pwg_album_manager_view=tile; pwg_user_manager_view=line; PHPSESSID=hjg1fi2funadnubkkvb7381ede Host: localhost Origin: http://localhost Referer: http://localhost/piwigo-12.2.0/piwigo/admin.php?page=cat_list sec-ch-ua: " Not;A Brand";v="99", "Google Chrome";v="97", "Chromium";v="97" sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows" Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-User: ?1 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36  pwg_token=4feeb12539296772205ca90e39d382aa&virtual_name=%3Csvg+onload%3Dalert%281%29%3E&submitAdd=  ```  [Screenshot - 2_3_2022 , 12_42_32 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18497191/152221531-dc8c660a-e2f6-45ec-bba5-2bfa6c8b1a65.png)  Please fix the vulnerability & let me know :).

| The ability to embedded some javascript in the album name or description is not new. We don't consider it as a vulnerability to fix.  In this way admin can easily takeover webmaster's access using [this technique](https://github.com/R0B1NL1N/WebHacking101/blob/master/xss-reflected-steal-cookie.md).  This is where I would like some details. Did you try this technique? Does it work? (on a Piwigo I mean). Stealing the session id in the cookie of a webmaster is not enough to steal its session... but if you have proof of concept, I'm highly interested. |
