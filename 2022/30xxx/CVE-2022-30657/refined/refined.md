Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-30657:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* Use After Free (CWE-416)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Adobe InCopy. This occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is not cleared, allowing for subsequent use of the freed memory, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Arbitrary code execution. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is local (AV:L).
* The attack complexity is low (AC:L).
* No privileges are required (PR:N).
* User interaction is required (UI:R).
* The scope is unchanged (S:U).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* An attacker would need to entice a user to open a specially crafted document or file that exploits the use-after-free vulnerability using Adobe InCopy. The attacker would need to have some means of getting the user to open this file.
