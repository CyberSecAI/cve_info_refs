Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure file deletion function in the `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php` file, specifically when the `f=delete_img` parameter is used. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `path` parameter provided in the POST request, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path for deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to delete any file on the server that the webserver user has permissions to access. This is due to the lack of input validation on the `path` parameter in `Master.php?f=delete_img`.
- **Lack of Authentication:** While not explicitly stated, the provided exploit implies that the `delete_img` function might not require proper authentication or authorization, or the attacker is assumed to have already bypassed any access control mechanisms.
- **Path Traversal:** The attack uses a full absolute path to the file to delete. This is a form of path traversal since the application is not expected to handle an arbitrary filesystem location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to delete any file, leading to potential data loss, including critical system files or application resources.
- **Service Disruption:** Deletion of crucial application files can cause the web application to malfunction or become unavailable.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** An attacker might delete existing application logic, or a backdoor could be planted if an attacker gains write access to the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via an HTTP POST request to `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img`.
- **`path` Parameter:** The malicious file path to be deleted is sent through the `path` parameter in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server.
- **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know (or guess) the full path of the file they want to delete.
- **Bypass or Have Authentication:** The attacker likely requires the ability to reach the affected endpoint, either through bypassing or having access through a login or other authorization method. The provided example shows an authentication cookie, implying the attacker is logged in or has a session.
