| **What is XSS** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser-side script, to a different end-user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.  Affected Version- 3.1.2  Demo installation: <https://localhost/Fudforum-3.1.2/>  **Reproduce bug:** Step 1 : Login with admin account and go to the Admin Control Panel. Step 2: In Categories & Forums, use Forum Manager to add new Forum to Private Forums. Step 3: Inject XSS payload to Forum Name field and complete Add Forum XSS payload : a<img src=x onerror=alert('xss')> Step 4: Go back to <http://localhost/FUDforum-3.1.2/index.php> Or Go to <http://localhost/FUDforum-3.1.2/adm/admgroups.php?&SQ=1da883e1cc4e8df02d59bcf5fc8edf54> -> XSS bug trigger  [Screenshot 2022-05-15 at 18 36 20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39631486/168470771-a0ed23a8-8c43-4dcd-b27c-2bdcab46e7e1.png)  **Impact of XSS:**  If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. Amongst other things, the attacker can:  Perform any action within the application that the user can perform. View any information that the user is able to view. Modify any information that the user is able to modify. Initiate interactions with other application users, including malicious attacks, that will appear to originate from the initial victim user. With the help of XSS a hacker or attacker can perform social engineering on users by redirecting them from real website to fake one. hacker can steal their cookies and download a malware on their system, and there are many more attacking scenarios a skilled attacker can perform with xss. |

| It needs to be fixed, but it's not critical, as it requires admin access. An forum admin is unlikely to hack his/her own forum. |
