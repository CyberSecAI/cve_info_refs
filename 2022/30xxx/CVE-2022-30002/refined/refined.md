The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Insurance Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the `nominee_id` parameter in the `editNominee.php` file is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `nominee_id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting SQL queries.
- An attacker can potentially modify data, leading to unauthorized changes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/insurance/editNominee.php` and injecting SQL code into the `nominee_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must have some knowledge about SQL and injection techniques.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability, as it appears to be directly accessible to anyone who can reach the application's URL.
