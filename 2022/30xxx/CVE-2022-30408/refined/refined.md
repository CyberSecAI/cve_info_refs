The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Covid-19 Travel Pass Management System v1.0 by oretnom23. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `delete_img` function within the `Master.php` file. This function is intended to delete image files, but it can be manipulated to delete any file on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Deletion:** The `delete_img` function does not properly validate the file path provided, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path for deletion.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `path` parameter is not sanitized, enabling the attacker to supply a path outside the intended directory for image deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file on the server accessible by the webserver user, potentially leading to:
    *   **Website Defacement/Disruption:** Deleting critical files can break the website functionality or cause it to become unavailable.
    *   **Data Loss:** Deleting database files or other important data files.
    *   **Complete System Compromise**: Attackers could delete web server configurations, or even operating system files, in certain circumstances

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to `/ctpms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img` with a `path` parameter containing the URL encoded path to the target file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the application is hosted.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable script `/ctpms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img`.
*   **Path to target file:** The attacker needs the path to the file they want to delete.
*   **Login not required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring a login.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/ctpms/classes/Master.php`
*   **Vulnerable Function:** `delete_img`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `path`

**Example Payload:**
