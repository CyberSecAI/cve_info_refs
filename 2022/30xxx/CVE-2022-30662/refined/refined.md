- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability, leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening a specially crafted file in Adobe InDesign. The attack vector is local, requiring the user to open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious file that can trigger the out-of-bounds write and convince the user to open it. No special privileges are required; user interaction (opening the crafted file) is required.
