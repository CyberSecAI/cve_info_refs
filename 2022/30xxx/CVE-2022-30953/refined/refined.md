Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-30953:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Blue Ocean Plugin does not perform adequate permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.
*   Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:**  The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on some of its HTTP endpoints.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The absence of POST request enforcement on these endpoints makes them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers with `Overall/Read` permission can send requests to an attacker-specified URL. This implies a potential for exfiltration of data or triggering unintended actions by the Jenkins server to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:**  Attackers send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user into sending malicious requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Permissions:** An attacker needs `Overall/Read` permission within the Jenkins instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
*   **User Interaction (CSRF):** For CSRF exploitation, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-30953 describes a combination of missing permission checks and CSRF vulnerability in the Blue Ocean plugin. This allows a user with `Overall/Read` permissions to send requests to an arbitrary URL, which could be used to initiate actions on the Jenkins server or exfiltrate data. The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to indirectly perform these actions by tricking a legitimate user.
