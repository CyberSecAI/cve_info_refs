```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application lacks proper input validation, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path to be deleted via the 'path' parameter in the /sns/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Deletion",
    "Insecure direct object reference (IDOR)",
    "Lack of input validation on the 'path' parameter"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete any file accessible to the web server, leading to potential data loss, service disruption, or further compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/sns/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img` with a 'path' parameter containing the URL-encoded absolute path of the file to be deleted.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and have knowledge of the file system to target specific files. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the vulnerable endpoint."
