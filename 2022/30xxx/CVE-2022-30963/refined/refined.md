Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2022-30963:

**CVE-2022-30963**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The JDK Parameter Plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter type it provides, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-controlled input (parameter names and descriptions) before rendering it in a web page.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they view a page where the vulnerable parameter is displayed. This can lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other malicious actions within the user's session.

*   **Attack Vectors**: An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious code in the name or description of the parameter type. This would be a stored XSS vulnerability.
    *   The crafted parameter definition would need to be shown on a page like "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters".

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs Item/Configure permission to modify job configurations and inject the malicious payload in the parameter name or description.
    *   The attacker needs a victim to visit the pages where these parameters are displayed for the XSS payload to trigger.

*   **Affected Plugin**: JDK Parameter Plugin

*   **Affected Versions**: 1.0 and earlier.

*  **Fix**: No fix is available for this plugin.

*  **Additional Notes:**
     * The content explicitly mentions that exploitation of this vulnerability requires that the parameters are listed on a page where they are not protected from such attacks. Jenkins core has mitigated this for "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2
     * Several plugins have been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation.
