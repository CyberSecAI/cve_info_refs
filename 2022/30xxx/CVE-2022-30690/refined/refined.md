Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30690:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `image403.php` file of the AVideo web application. Specifically, the `403ErrorMsg` parameter, which is taken from either GET or POST requests, is directly inserted into the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application reflects the unsanitized input back to the user within the HTML context of the page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The code directly uses `$_REQUEST['403ErrorMsg']` without any form of sanitization, which is vulnerable to injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** By tricking a user (especially an administrator) into clicking a crafted link, an attacker could potentially gain access to their account, leading to complete control of the AVideo platform.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** An attacker could use the injected JavaScript to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data, and to manipulate the website to their advantage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attack is performed through a specially crafted HTTP request that includes the malicious JavaScript code within the `403ErrorMsg` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the crafted URL to trigger the vulnerability, either by directly clicking a link or via other injection vectors.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to craft URLs:**  An attacker needs the ability to create a URL with a malicious payload.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker might need some social engineering to trick users to click on malicious URL in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability can be triggered without prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can use a crafted URL to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- The vendor has confirmed the issue was fixed on July 7, 2022.
- The fix mentioned in the updateDb.v12.0.sql file (TALOS-2022-1539) adds a sanitization rule to the `view/img/image403.php` file.
