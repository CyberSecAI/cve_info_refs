**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability is categorized as an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer or memory region.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker would need local access to the vulnerable system, and the user interaction is required(UI:R) by the attacker. The privilege required is none (PR:N) meaning that no special access or privileges are needed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
