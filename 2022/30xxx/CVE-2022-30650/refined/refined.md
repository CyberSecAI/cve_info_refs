- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access, user interaction (requires the user to open a malicious file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious file that triggers the buffer overflow when opened by the victim. The attacker does not require any special privileges and the user must open the malicious file.
