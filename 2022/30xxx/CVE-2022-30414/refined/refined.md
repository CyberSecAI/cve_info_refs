Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `Covid-19 Travel Pass Management System v1.0`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the URL `/ctpms/admin/?page=applications/view_application&id=`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including the database name. In this case the attacker is able to determine that the database name is "ctpms\_db" via blind SQL injection, by guessing the length of the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL, injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to access this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker uses a crafted payload such as `/ctpms/admin/?page=applications/view_application&id=1'%20and%20length(database())%20=8--+` to determine the length of the database name using blind SQL injection.
- The attacker identifies a difference in the response `Content-Length` of the page when the database length is equal to the value guessed, which allows the attacker to leak information.
- The content provides specific vulnerable file `/ctpms/admin/?page=applications/view_application&id=` and parameter `id`.
- The applicationâ€™s database name is revealed to be `ctpms_db`.
- The content also provides the login credentials `admin/admin123`.

This information is more detailed than a basic CVE description, as it includes the exact vulnerable parameter, example payload, and steps for exploitation.
