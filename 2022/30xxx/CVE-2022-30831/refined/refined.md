{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `wedding_details.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLi). Specifically, a boolean-based blind SQL injection is present, demonstrated through the ability to infer the database name length.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify database records, or potentially gain unauthorized access to the system. In the example provided, the attacker is able to determine the database name by exploiting this vulnerability.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `wedding_details.php` endpoint with a malicious crafted `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. An understanding of SQLi is needed to craft effective payloads."
