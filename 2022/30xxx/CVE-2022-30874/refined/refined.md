Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-30874:

**Root Cause:**

*   Improper input sanitization and encoding of the "Link" parameter when adding or modifying menu items within the NukeViet CMS admin panel. The same issue affects the "Link to Page" parameter in the "Voting Option".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the "Link" field in the menu or the "Link to Page" in the voting functionality and stored in the database. This code is then executed when other users (including admins) visit the affected parts of the website, which can cause the injected script to execute in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Tampering:** An attacker can modify the content displayed to users.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can steal session cookies of other users, potentially leading to account takeover, including privileged admin accounts.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although the initial attack requires admin access to modify menu items or voting options, the resulting XSS can be used to perform actions with the privileges of any user who visits the affected pages including admin user
*   **Manipulating voting results:** An attacker can manipulate voting results by injecting malicious script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the administrative web interface of NukeViet CMS.
*   **Input Field:** The primary attack vector involves inserting malicious code into the "Link" field when creating/modifying menu items or "Link to Page" when modifying the voting option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify menu items or voting options within the NukeViet CMS admin panel in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Dawid Bakaj.
*   The vulnerability affects NukeViet CMS versions prior to 4.5.02.
*   Multiple attempts to fix this vulnerability were made.
*   The provided information includes links to external resources for additional details like a proof of concept and the vulnerability's timeline.

**CVSS Vector:**

*   CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N (Network, Low complexity, High privileges, User interaction required, Scope changed, Low confidentiality impact, Low integrity impact, No availability impact).

**Summary:**

The content describes a Stored XSS vulnerability in NukeViet CMS. Attackers with admin privileges can inject malicious scripts through specific input fields, which then affect other users who visit the website. This can lead to data tampering, session hijacking, and privilege escalation. The vulnerability requires an attacker to have administrative access to the application to inject the malicious payload and the user visiting the website to trigger the vulnerability.
