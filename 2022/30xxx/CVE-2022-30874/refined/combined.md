### #2968 Stored Cross-Site Scripting.

#### URL / Location of vulnerability

/nukeviet/admin/index.php?language=en&nv=menu&op=rows&mid=1

#### Description

Hi Nukeviet Team.

I managed to exploit Stored XSS in Nukeviet CMS. Vulnerability is being exploited from the privilaged user account. Vulnerability suffers from imporer input encoding and sanitization of the Link Parameter.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. Navigate to Admin Panel which is located at /nukeviet/admin/index.php
2. Next navigate to Navigation Bar option:

![image.png](https://whitehub.net/attachments/3980)

3. Navigate to "Top Menu" (location: /admin/index.php?language=en&nv=menu&op=rows&mid=1)
4. Add item with following values and click Save:

   Item Name: XSSTEST

   Link: "> <scr<script>ipt>alert(document.domain)</scr<script>ipt>

![image.png](https://whitehub.net/attachments/3981)

5. Item should be saved as follows:

![image.png](https://whitehub.net/attachments/3982)

6. Next visit the website as a regular non-privilaged user or an admin user. XSS Alert should appear.

![image.png](https://whitehub.net/attachments/3983)

There are many affected input fields of the same issue in your CMS for example :

1. "Voting Option" (/nukeviet/admin/index.php?language=en&nv=voting) -> "Link to Page" \* Modify second option from the list as it is not checking whether input is a URL or not:

![image.png](https://whitehub.net/attachments/3985)

Visit voting page(/nukeviet/en/voting/) as a regular or admin user - XSS alert should appear:

![image.png](https://whitehub.net/attachments/3986)

#### Impact

It is reasonable to fix the issue as the vulnerability would allow privilaged user who exploit the vulnerability to steal other user's or admin's session cookies which lead to account takeover and manipulating the voting results.

#### Recommendation

Encode and sanitize all parameters input fields.

## STM Cyber Statement regarding the Internal Control System

Validity of the Internal Control System

The effectiveness of the Internal Control System (ISC) is based on a written statement of the ICM Policy. This document, addressed to all employees, presents the company's official position on turnover control and the implementation and maintenance of WSK.

The Company's policy regarding international trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance

Our company conducts foreign trade in goods of strategic importance by the law of the Republic of Poland, international regulations, and principles resulting from non-proliferation agreements in which Poland participates.

Aware of the role we play in ensuring national and international security by preventing uncontrolled trade in dual-use goods and weapons, we have implemented and maintained an Internal Control System in our company.

If it turns out that a given transaction is inconsistent with national law or the potential contractor raises reasonable suspicions of violating international rules on trade in goods, technologies, and services of strategic importance, the transaction will not be completed.

Our company excludes the possibility of making profits in a manner contrary to the trade control policy.

All employees, entities, and cooperating persons who are familiar with the requirements of the Internal Control System are obliged to comply with them and immediately inform the WSK Representative about any transactions, practices, or attempted actions that are inconsistent with applicable law.

If non-compliance with the requirements is detected, the company takes appropriate corrective, elimination, and preventive actions.

The involvement of all employees in maintaining the functionality of the Internal Control System increases trust in our company, making it more competitive and credible.

Employees are obliged to comply with the principles set out in this statement under penalty of professional liability.

# [CVE-2022-30874](https://blog.stmcyber.com/vulns/cve-2022-30874/)

**Name**

Stored XSS in menu item link

**CVSS score**

4.8 (Medium)

**CVSS vector**

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Product name**

NukeViet CMS

**Confirmed exploitable versions**

< 4.5.02

**Researcher**

Dawid Bakaj

**Description**

NukeViet CMS allows top menu modification via admin panel. Value passed as new menu item's URL is not properly sanitized, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in version 4.5.02 or earlier. Prior administrative access to the website is required for exploitation. Successful attack may result in tampering with data presented to users or exfiltration of information from the victim's current session.

**Proof-of-concept**

1. Navigate to "Top Menu" section in the admin panel (location: `/admin/index.php?language=en&nv=menu&op=rows&mid=1`).
2. Add item with following values and click Save:
   * Item Name: `XSSTEST`
   * Link: `"> <scr<script>ipt>alert(document.domain)</scr<script>ipt>`
3. Visit the website as a regular non-privileged user or an admin user. XSS alert box should appear.

Voting functionality was also affected by the same vulnerability.
