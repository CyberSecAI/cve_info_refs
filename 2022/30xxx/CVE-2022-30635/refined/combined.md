Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.18.4 and 1.17.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 9 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: improper sanitization of Transfer-Encoding header

  The HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as indicating a "chunked" encoding. This could potentially allow for request smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly failed to reject the header as invalid.

  This is CVE-2022-1705 and <https://go.dev/issue/53188>.
* When httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP was called with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy would set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its documentation. In the more usual case where a Director function set the X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy would leave the header unmodified as expected.

  This is <https://go.dev/issue/53423> and CVE-2022-32148.

  Thanks to Christian Mehlmauer for reporting this issue.
* compress/gzip: stack exhaustion in Reader.Read

  Calling Reader.Read on an archive containing a large number of concatenated 0-length compressed files can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30631 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53168>.
* encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Unmarshal

  Calling Unmarshal on a XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field that uses the `any` field tag can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30633 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53611>.
* encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Skip

  Calling Decoder.Skip when parsing a deeply nested XML document can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  The Go Security team discovered this issue, and it was independently reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.

  This is CVE-2022-28131 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53614>.
* encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

  Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30635 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53615>.
* path/filepath: stack exhaustion in Glob

  Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-30632 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53416>.
* io/fs: stack exhaustion in Glob

  Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30630 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53415>.
* go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse\* functions

  Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested types or declarations can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-1962 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53616>.

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.4>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.18.4` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Michael and Heschi for the Go team

encoding/gob: add a depth limit for ignored fields

Enforce a nesting limit of 10,000 for ignored fields during decoding
of messages. This prevents the possibility of triggering stack
exhaustion.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
