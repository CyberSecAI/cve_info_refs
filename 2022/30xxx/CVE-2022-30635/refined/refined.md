Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-30635:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Uncontrolled recursion in `encoding/gob.Decoder.Decode` when processing deeply nested structures.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack exhaustion due to unbounded recursion during the decoding process of `gob` messages with deep nesting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit leads to a panic due to stack exhaustion, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network. An attacker can send a specially crafted `gob` message with deeply nested structures to a vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the target service. No specific privileges or user interaction is required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Go versions before 1.17.12 and in versions 1.18.0 through 1.18.3
- The vulnerability is fixed by enforcing a nesting limit of 10,000 for ignored fields during decoding of messages.
- The affected symbols are `Decoder.compileDec`, `Decoder.compileIgnoreSingle`, and `Decoder.decIgnoreOpFor`.
