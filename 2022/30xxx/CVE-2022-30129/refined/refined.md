{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an argument injection flaw in the Git extension of Visual Studio Code when handling `vscode://` deep links. Specifically, the `git.clone` command within the Git extension directly incorporates the provided URL into the command line argument of the git clone operation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary Git options by crafting a malicious URL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Argument Injection",
	  "Insufficient URL validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine by injecting malicious Git options through crafted URLs. For instance, using the `-u` or `--upload-pack` Git option to specify an alternative program to be executed during the cloning process.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious link that, when clicked by a user with Visual Studio Code installed, triggers the vulnerable `git.clone` operation. The crafted link uses the `vscode://` protocol to invoke the vulnerable code and pass malicious arguments to the Git command.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the custom `vscode://` scheme and convince the victim to click on it. The victim needs to have Visual Studio Code installed. The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have credentials on the victim's machine. The attacker can be a remote attacker."
  },
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "Visual Studio Code",
    "version": "Versions prior to 1.67.1"
  },
   "patch": "The vulnerability was addressed by introducing stricter validation of URLs used in git clone operations. The patch uses a URI parser to check the URL scheme against a whitelist, preventing the injection of malicious options. This ensures the URL is treated as a URL and not as a positional argument."
