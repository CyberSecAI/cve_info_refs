Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in specific parameters of Cybozu Office 10. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs when user-supplied input, specifically within certain parameters, is not properly sanitized and is then rendered in the application's output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the web browser of a logged-in user of Cybozu Office.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation/Theft:** The injected script can potentially steal session cookies, manipulate the web page, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions within the scope of the compromised user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network (AV:N):** The attack is performed over the network.
*   **Specific Parameters:** The vulnerability lies within specific parameters of the application. These parameters are not specified in the provided content.
*   **User Interaction (UI:R):** The attack requires user interaction. A user must click on a malicious link, open a manipulated page, or perform other actions that load the injected script in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No Authentication Required (PR:N):** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target system.
*   **Vulnerable Cybozu Office Instance:** The attacker needs access to an instance of Cybozu Office vulnerable to XSS and a vector to inject the malicious script

**Additional details:**
*   **CVSS v3 Score:** 6.1 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N) - This score indicates a medium severity.
*   **CVSS v2 Score:** 2.6 (AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N) - This score indicates a low severity under the older CVSSv2 framework.

**Summary:** This CVE describes a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Cybozu Office that arises from inadequate input sanitization of certain parameters. The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL that injects a script into a user's browser session.
