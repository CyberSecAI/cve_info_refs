Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30596:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user ID numbers displayed when bulk allocating markers to assignments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the displayed user ID fields, which are then stored and executed when other users view the assignment allocation form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking/cookie theft
    - Defacement of the Moodle site
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
    - Potential redirection to malicious websites

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to inject malicious script into a user ID field that is used in the assignment bulk marker allocation form. This could be done by adding a malicious user id.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the assignment allocation form where the malicious user ID is displayed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to add an entry in the system, that would result in their malicious input being added as a user ID in the assignment bulk marker allocation form.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, but the ability to create/edit user data, that results in the malicious ID being listed in the bulk marker allocation form would be required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 4.0, 3.11 to 3.11.6, 3.10 to 3.10.10, 3.9 to 3.9.13 and earlier unsupported versions.
- Fixed versions are 4.0.1, 3.11.7, 3.10.11 and 3.9.14.
- The fix involves additional sanitizing of user ID numbers displayed in the bulk marker allocation form.
- The Moodle tracker issue for this vulnerability is MDL-74204.
- The commit that fixed this vulnerability is referenced as <http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-74204>
- Fedora has released updates for Fedora 34, 35 and 36 to address this vulnerability in their moodle package.
