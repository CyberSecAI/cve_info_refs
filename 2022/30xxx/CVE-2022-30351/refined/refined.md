  "CVE-2022-30351": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "PDFzorro is vulnerable to information leakage via full text redaction. The tool draws a black box over text selected for redaction, but the original PDF text object is still present. This allows users to select and copy the text behind the black box.",
    "details": [
      {
        "weakness": "Full text redaction vulnerability: The redaction tool does not remove the original text when applying a redaction, instead it draws a black box over the text. This leaves the original content easily accessible by copying and pasting",
        "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the redaction by selecting and copying the underlying text.",
        "attack_vector": "The attacker can directly access the unredacted text by selecting and copying the text that has been covered by a black box.",
          "capabilities": "No special capabilities are needed. Any user with access to the PDF file can extract the unredacted content."
