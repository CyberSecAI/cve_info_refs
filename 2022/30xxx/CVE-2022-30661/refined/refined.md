- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-122) exists in Adobe InDesign.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction (opening a specially crafted file).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious file that, when opened by a victim using a vulnerable version of Adobe InDesign, triggers the buffer overflow. No special privileges are required.
