- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS runtime system limits the number of incoming TCP connections (CmpBlkDrvTcp) or channel connections (CmpChannelServer, CmpChannelServerEmbedded). Once this limit is reached, it does not allow any new client connections.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400) due to a lack of proper handling of connection limits. Specifically, CmpBlkDrvTcp allows blocking of all available TCP connections, while CmpChannelServer and CmpChannelServerEmbedded allow blocking of all available communication channels.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can block all available TCP or channel connections, preventing legitimate users or clients from establishing new connections to the CODESYS runtime system. Repeated attacks can permanently block new connections. Existing connections remain unaffected.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and requires low skills to exploit the vulnerability.
