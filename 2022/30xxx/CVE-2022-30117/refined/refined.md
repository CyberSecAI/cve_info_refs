Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-30117:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Path traversal vulnerability in the `/index.php/ccm/system/file/upload` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient sanitization of the file upload path, allowing directory traversal.
- Inadequate validation of file chunks during upload, allowing early exit by providing invalid input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion. An attacker could potentially delete files they shouldn't have access to by exploiting the path traversal vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack via the `/index.php/ccm/system/file/upload` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload files. This is indicated by the CVSS vector including "PR:H" which means "Privileges Required: High".
- The attacker needs to manipulate the file upload path to include traversal sequences like "../".
