* Added the ability to view a user’s public profile from their Dashboard user details page.
* Added `--session-handler` to the console install utility. Set to `database` if you’d like to override the default file-based sessions.
* Gotten rid of the behavior where certain dynamic trees cause pages to scroll to them on load (visible on Express Object details edit, adding groups, using the Groups selector in custom Dashboard pages, and more)
* JavaScript and CSS assets now have the timestamp of when the cache was last cleared appended to them (thanks deek87, haeflimi)
* Added the link back to the “Data Objects” Express management interface from the header of that Express objects results page.
* Added URL Path as a column that can be added to the Page Search interface.

## Backward Compatibility Notes

* The `Concrete\Core\Express\Form\Validator\Routine\RoutineInterface` class and all classes that implement it has changed. The `validate` method now takes a nullable third parameter for the `Concrete\Core\Entity\Express\Entry` object that may or may not exist. This replaces the request type attribute. The request type can now be inferred - if the entry does not exist, we assume this to be an `ADD` operation. If the entry exists within the `validate` method, you are running an `UPDATE` operation.
* Block::duplicate() has changed its secondary parameter from $isCopiedWhenPropagated to $controllerMethodToTryAndRun. This lets us choose `duplicate_master` or the new `duplicate_clipboard` in certain situations. It is very unlikely that this should impact any custom code you have written as this is pretty deep in the Concrete internals.
* If you have customized the Document Library view template, please ensure that your `<form>` tag has a valid input button with the name `”search”`. This is checked in the controller in order to ensure searching is actually occurring. If you want to search by advanced file attributes, you’ll need this to be in place or else the Document Library controller will not check for attribute searching.

## Developer Updates

* Added `on_page_version_delete` event (thanks hathawayweb)
* Mail Importer code running on ancient Zend Mail code updated to PHP 7+ (thanks KevinBLT)
* Patches to third party libraries to allow for installation on PHP 8.1 w/Composer (thanks mlocati)
* htmlawed HTML sanitization library updated for better compatibility with HTML5.
* IP Access Control: add IpAccessControlCategory::describeTimeWindow() (thanks mlocati)
* Allow Date service class to work with DateTimeImmutable objects (thanks mlocati)
* Improvements and bug fixes to route building and controller syntax (thanks mlocati)
* More reliable running of on\_start() in block controllers before page contents are rendered (thanks hissy)
* Moved concrete5/dependency-patches to the core composer.json instead of the separate composer project (thanks mlocati)
* Improved code commenting throughout all core blocks (thanks deek87)
* Fix list\_syntax rule of PHP-CS-Fixer (thanks mlocati)
* Significant list of third party PHP script minor updates.
* Simplify c5:exec return code (thanks mlocati)
* Fixed: Task scheduling command is incorrect on dashboard page and in documentation, needs more detail
* `Concrete\Core\Http\ResponseFactory` used to take `$session` as its first constructor dependency, even though that was not used. This caused problems in the event response factory was used prior to sessions being available or being configured for database sessions that were not yet installed. This parameter has been removed. If you use the `$app->make()` method of building this class, you should not be affected.
* Now using https:// for communication with the Concrete marketplace even when the user’s site is not https://

## Security Fixes

* Fixed several places where we weren’t sanitizing file names in the file manager and stacks page.
* Remediated CVE-2022-21829 - Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below can download zip files over HTTP and execute code from those zip files which could lead to an RCE. Fixed by enforcing ‘concrete\_secure’ instead of ‘concrete’. Concrete now only makes requests over https even if a request comes in via http. Concrete CMS security team ranked this 8 with CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H Credit goes to Anna for reporting on HackerOne - https://hackerone.com/reports/1482520
* Remediated CVE-2022-30117 - Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below allowed traversal in /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload which could result in an Arbitrary File Delete exploit. This was remediated by sanitizing /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload to ensure Concrete doesn’t allow traversal and by changing isFullChunkFilePresent to have an early false return when input doesn't match expectations.Concrete CMS Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H. Credit to Siebene for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1482280
* Remediated CVE-2022-30120 - XSS in /dashboard/blocks/stacks/view\_details/ - old browsers only. When using an older browser with built-in XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are output can be exploited for Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Dashboard Stacks page sort URLs are now sanitized. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 3.1 with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Sanitation has been added where built urls are output. Credit to Bogdan Tiron from FORTBRIDGE (https://www.fortbridge.co.uk/ ) for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1363598
* Remediated CVE-2022-30119 - XSS in /dashboard/reports/logs/view - old browsers only. When using Internet Explorer with the XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are output can be exploited for Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 2 with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Sanitation has been added where built urls are output.

**Improvements?**

Let us know
[by posting here](https://forums.concretecms.org/c/documentation/24).

## Behavioral Improvements

* JavaScript and CSS assets now have the timestamp of when the cache was last cleared appended to them (thanks deek87, haeflimi)
* Renamed concrete5 to Concrete CMS and Concrete during the installation process.
* Nicer version history view in add-on update screen (thanks biplobice)

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed error that would occur if you deleted an Express entry and then attempted to reorder that same entry on the page before reloading (thanks biplobice)
* Fixed error where users, files and sites weren’t being reindexed when running the `index_search_all` job.
* Fixed error where copying conversation blocks out from page defaults made them all one instance of the same conversation (thanks hissy)
* Validating Express, User and Page attribute types now works when used with Composer and Expres (thanks hissy)
* Fixed bug in Redis caching backend when saving a primitive value.
* Fixed: when using the Express Form block, and a file is uploaded through the form, it creates two versions of the file, which are seemingly identical (thanks 1stthomas)
* Fixed: Clear old page versions in all site trees when running remove page versions job (thanks Ruud-Zuiderlicht)
* Fixed bug where OAuth2 and sign in as user functionality could lead to someone unintentionally joining their user account to a different account.
* Render single pages like 404, 403, login, register in default site locale (thanks hissy)
* Fixed: : error message doesn't display when upload file failed via drag & drop (thanks hissy)
* Fixed invalid and unhelpful displaying on marketplace connection failures during certain conditions (thanks JohnTheFish)
* Topics Attribute Search Form is not getting translated on Frontend (thanks 1stthomas)
* Fixed: Multilingual copy site tree with alias pages (thanks hissy)
* Fix migration bug on fix overlapping start end dates when custom page publishing dates had been set in some cases (thanks hissy)
* Fixed null pointer Exceptions when using area layouts under certain conditions (thanks biplobice)

## Security Fixes

* CKEditor updated from 4.16.2 to 4.18.0 (thanks hissy)
* Remediated CVE-2022-21829 - Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below can download zip files over HTTP and execute code from those zip files which could lead to an RCE. Fixed by enforcing ‘concrete\_secure’ instead of ‘concrete’. Concrete now only makes requests over https even if a request comes in via http. Concrete CMS security team ranked this 8 with CVSS v3.1 vector: AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H Credit goes to Anna for reporting on HackerOne - https://hackerone.com/reports/1482520
* Remediated CVE-2022-30117 - Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below allowed traversal in /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload which could result in an Arbitrary File Delete exploit. This was remediated by sanitizing /index.php/ccm/system/file/upload to ensure Concrete doesn’t allow traversal and by changing isFullChunkFilePresent to have an early false return when input doesn't match expectations.Concrete CMS Security team ranked this 5.8 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H. Credit to Siebene for reporting https://hackerone.com/reports/1482280
* Remediated CVE-2022-30120 - XSS in /dashboard/blocks/stacks/view\_details/ - old browsers only. When using an older browser with built-in XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are output can be exploited for Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism. Dashboard Stacks page sort URLs are now sanitized. Concrete CMS Security team ranked this vulnerability 3.1 with CVSS v3.1 Vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N. Sanitation has been added where built urls are output.

* Remediated CVE-2022-30119 - XSS in /dashboard/reports/logs/view - old browsers only. When using Internet Explorer with the XSS protection disabled, insufficient sanitation where built urls are output can be exploited for Concrete CMS Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below to allow XSS. This cannot be exploited in modern-day web browsers due to an automatic input escape mechanism.
