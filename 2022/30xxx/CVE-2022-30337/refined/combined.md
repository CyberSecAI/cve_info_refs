How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

### Meta information bulk edition and image SEO

Editing meta information on an existing website can be very long, open each post, edit, close it, open again and almost nobody was doing it. Especially if you need to edit content + image meta.

WP Meta SEO is going to list all posts, pages, custom post types and all images. Type your meta content and fix image size and everything is AJAX saved.

Plus, a bulk copy feature is available to save tons of time in your SEO optimization process:

* Content title to All meta titles (optional meta keywords)
* Image name to Image title
* Image name to Image alt
* Optional keyword edition

A bunch of people reduce the size of the pictures in content using handles that results to a HTML resizing. And that’s something wrong for SEO, for page loading time and for image quality.

WP Meta SEO also include this feature in the bulk edition view, you are notified, and you can now optimize the size of your images in articles, click fix, and it’s replaced in your content (no broken links).

### Requirements

#### !!NEW in latest & fresh 3.0 version!!

Sitemap feature with XML for the Google Search Console and HTML with display option.

#### SEO vision

Search engines are a major source of traffic for most websites. That’s why our users often ask us for SEO tips and plugins that can help improve SEO of their WordPress sites.

WP Meta SEO has been created to give to professionals and final users some real SEO tools to get better SEO rank. We think that SEO has to be something logic and durable. Overall SEO optimization requires a lot of time for each website, each client.

WP Meta SEO provides some automatic tools to analyze your content and give to search engine a better content to analyze.

WP Meta SEO on each new version, will focus on both “On-page SEO” and “Global website SEO” factors:

On-page SEO: Features that help you optimize a single page, e.g. the article you are working on (with a live analysis). Common functionality includes giving SEO scores to each article, content/meta comparison, page analysis tools and making recommendations how to improve the SEO of a post.

Site-wide SEO: it’s more about your whole site and structure between multiple articles. Common functionality includes title formatting, meta tag optimization as well as internal linking and redirects management.

And… don’t forget to check each month your SEO dashboard 🙂

PHP 5.6+, WordPress 5.x

## FAQ

### Will the image rename bulk feature generate broken links?

Not at all, it would have been bad for SEO 🙂 the image name is dynamically replaced in all your content.

### If I edit image title and alt text, will that information be loaded each time my image is in a content?

There’s an SEO option for that 🙂 WP Meta SEO will detect that the image has missing information and once edit it, you will have a list of all the image instance and where it’s loaded.

So you’ll be able to define SEO info for each instance.

### Is WP Meta SEO slowing down my website?

Nope 🙂 All your SEO content is properly stored in the database and automatic SEO checks are also cached or run every 72 hours (unless you force the process)

### Is WP Meta SEO compatible with 3rd party plugins?

YES it is 🙂 All plugins and themes that are using custom post type are compatible, and you’ll be able to set up SEO for those content. Plus, Yoast SEO and All in one SEO content can also be imported.

### Is WP Meta SEO fixing 404 errors?

Yes, using a redirect manager tool. WP Meta SEO will index all the 404 you have in your content (internal broken links).

### Can I translate WP Meta SEO?

You’re welcome! In the WP Meta SEO package, you got English and French included as standard .po/.mo files. Use the .pot file also available in the /language folder to create your own.

You can contact us if you want it to be included in the WP Meta SEO package.

### How can I set up the Google Analytics to get statistics?

First create an account on Google Analytics associated to your domain. Then from the plugin connect your website with your analytics account by copy/pasting a token code.

### Compatibility

What’s the minimum version of WordPress required to run WP Meta SEO? WordPress 4.0 is required. WP Meta SEO may generate PHP errors if you tried to run it on an earlier version, and so it will simply refuse to activate on any version of WordPress that’s older than 4.0

### Where on WordPress does WP Meta SEO plugin should be displayed?

In the admin of WordPress, on the left menu named WP Meta SEO and its sub menu for SEO tools

### How do I uninstall WP Meta SEO?

Go to the Plugins > WP Meta SEO > Deactivate > Delete

### Which browsers work best with the WP Meta SEO administration interface?

WP Meta SEO is using HTML5 features so to be certain run the latest version of Chrome / Firefox / Safari or IE9+

### Can I help with WP Meta SEO translation?

Yes! you can contact us on our forum. SEO as its language and expression, we would be happy to add yours.

### Why including meta keywords’ edition as it’s not a SEO rank criteria?

Because it may help in some case for SEO, mainly for multilingual website, it helps search engines to validate the page language. Some automatic SEO tool may use it too.

### Some criteria of the SEO on page analysis does not fit my content

Yes, it may be the case when, for example, you are calling 3rd party plugins in content or using specific page layouts. You have a global option to force validation of SEO criteria.

This manual SEO validation on click on the reload analysis button.

### How do I submit my sitemap to the Google Search Console?

From the Sitemap section of the plugin, you got a link to the XML sitemap page. Just copy/paste the link in the Google Search Console.

You can also use the link: www.your-website.com/sitemap.xml after checking the option to copy the sitemap to the WordPress install root.

### Is there a real interest for SEO to display a HTML sitemap?

It could be! If you have many pages that need to be indexed with no specific priority. Our advice is to keep only the main menus of your website in the HTML sitemap.

### Is it compatible with Gutenberg Editor?

Yes WP Meta SEO is compatible with Gutenberg editor since 3.7 version.

I’ve been using WP Meta SEO for about 7 years and I can confidently say it’s one of the best SEO plugins available for WordPress. It simplifies on-page SEO optimization, making it incredibly easy to manage meta titles, descriptions, and image SEO across my entire website.
The bulk editing feature is a game-changer, saving me hours of manual work. I also love the built-in SEO analysis tool, which provides clear recommendations to improve rankings. The integration with Google Search Console and other analytics tools offers valuable insights for tracking performance.
The interface is user-friendly, even for beginners, and the support team is responsive and helpful whenever I have questions. If you’re looking for an efficient, reliable, and feature-rich SEO plugin, WP Meta SEO is the perfect choice.
Highly recommended for anyone serious about improving their website’s SEO performance! 🚀

I’ve started a month ago but still have’nt got the time to grasp & update what it is required – still learning to do. It would be more beneficial if there is online guideline for making this full efficiency for SEO.
JoomlaUnited plugins for Wordpress are excellent especially the Media one.
