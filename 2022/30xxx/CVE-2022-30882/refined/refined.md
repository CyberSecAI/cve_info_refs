Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A malicious backdoor was introduced into version 0.2 of the `pyanxdns` package. This backdoor was specifically found within the `request` package, which was a dependency of `pyanxdns`. The issue seems to stem from a typo in the `setup.py` file that resulted in the inclusion of the malicious `request` package.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Supply chain attack:** The vulnerability represents a supply chain attack, where a malicious package was included as a dependency in a legitimate project. This allowed the malicious code to be distributed to users who installed `pyanxdns` version 0.2.
- **Typosquatting/Dependency Confusion:** While not explicitly stated, the issue likely involves typosquatting or dependency confusion, where a malicious actor created a package named similarly to a legitimate dependency (likely intending to spoof the actual `requests` package) and introduced it through a typo.
- **Malicious code execution:** The installed malicious package can execute arbitrary code on the user's system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The primary impact is that attackers could execute arbitrary code on the systems of users who installed the vulnerable version of `pyanxdns`. This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Dependency installation:** The attack vector is through the installation of the malicious `pyanxdns` package version 0.2, which includes a malicious `request` package as a dependency.
- **Mirror site compromise:** Although the malicious `request` package was removed from PyPI, the issue describes the potential for the malicious package to persist on mirror sites allowing users to install the malicious version from those locations by specifying a mirror site.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Package publishing:** The attacker needed the ability to publish malicious packages to PyPI or a similar repository. This could involve compromising an existing account or creating a new one with a similar name to a legitimate package.
- **Typo/Dependency Confusion:** An understanding of how Python dependencies are installed to be able to exploit dependency confusion (either by typo or otherwise).
- **Mirror Site Persistence:** The attacker doesn't require access to mirror sites themselves, but rather a mirror site to not have removed the malicious package, allowing it to persist.

**Additional notes:**
- The maintainer of `pyanxdns` has stated they have fixed the typo in the `setup.py` file, removed older versions from PyPI, and uploaded a new version. They also added information to the README.md file to warn users.
- The issue highlights the importance of verifying the integrity of dependencies and using trusted sources for package installations. It also emphasizes the need for package repositories to quickly remove malicious packages to prevent further compromise.
- The issue mentions that "many mirror sites did not completely delete this package," which could cause continued risk if users specified untrusted sources.
