Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `delete_sub_category` function in `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php`. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any input validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the query via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as database names, table structures, and user information, by using techniques like `SELECT` statements.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker can also use SQL injection to modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data loss or corruption.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, depending on the database server privileges and configuration, SQL injection can sometimes be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP POST request to the `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php?f=delete_sub_category` endpoint.
- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter in the POST request body.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable web application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL to craft the malicious injection payloads.
- **Application Understanding:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how the web application works, specifically the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `id=2' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` demonstrates a successful SQL injection attack.
    - `updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)` is used to extract the database name.
    - The `'` character closes the existing query and the injected payload is executed.
    - `--+` is used to comment out the rest of the query to prevent errors.
- The vulnerable file is `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php?f=delete_sub_category`.
- The request includes the `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header, suggesting it is part of an AJAX call.

This detailed analysis provides a clear understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability, its exploitation, and its impact. The provided technical details, such as the vulnerable file and the specific injection payload, help confirm the vulnerability's presence and severity.
