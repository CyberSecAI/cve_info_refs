The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Merchandise Online Store v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=inventory/manage_inventory` endpoint. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unfiltered user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information by manipulating the SQL query, including the database name. This is shown by the provided example payload which determines the length of the database name.
- Full database takeover: The attacker may perform additional SQL injection attacks to potentially modify, delete or obtain all data in the database.
- Application compromise: Depending on the database user permission, a successful SQL injection could potentially lead to a full application compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable URL with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=inventory/manage_inventory&id=`.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication in the specific endpoint, but needs to have access to the admin panel since the vulnerable URL is under `/vloggers_merch/admin/`.
