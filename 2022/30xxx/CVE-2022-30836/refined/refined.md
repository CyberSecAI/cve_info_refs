{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, leading to SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `/Wedding-Management/admin/select.php` file via the `id` parameter.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. This includes database name, potentially other table data, and sensitive information such as user credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/Wedding-Management/admin/select.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required for this vulnerability, as the SQL injection is present in a publicly accessible area of the system."
