Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-30639:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software has a flaw that allows writing data beyond the intended buffer boundaries. This is an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L) with low attack complexity (AC:L). User interaction (UI:R) is required, which means the user must perform some action, such as opening a crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability and requires the user to perform an action like opening a malicious file. The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) on the system.
