Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the NCIE Scanner module of Trend Micro Internet Security. It stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a read operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core issue is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The software fails to adequately validate user-supplied data, which is a prerequisite for triggering the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to disclose sensitive information present in the system's memory.
*   **Privilege Escalation (with other vulns):**  The advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to escalate privileges to SYSTEM and execute arbitrary code. This is not a direct impact of this vulnerability alone but is mentioned to be achievable using other vulns.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. This implies a local attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Code Execution:** The attacker must be able to run code with low privileges on the target system.
