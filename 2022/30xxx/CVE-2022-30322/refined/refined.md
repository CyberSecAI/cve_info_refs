Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30322:

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-30322 is one of multiple vulnerabilities identified in the HashiCorp go-getter library. This particular vulnerability, along with others (CVE-2022-26945, CVE-2022-30321, CVE-2022-30323), was addressed in go-getter versions 1.6.1 and 2.1.0.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the go-getter library processes HTTP responses, specifically when handling custom HTTP response headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Protocol switching, endless redirect, and configuration bypass:** These were possible through the abuse of custom HTTP response header processing. The exact mechanism is not fully detailed, but the vulnerability likely involves manipulating headers to redirect requests to unexpected protocols or locations, potentially bypassing intended configurations or security measures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Undermined data retrieval:**  The protocol switching and redirect issues could enable an attacker to make the go-getter fetch data from unintended sources or cause it to become stuck in an endless redirect loop which could be used for denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP Responses:** An attacker could control a server that the go-getter library connects to, and manipulate the HTTP responses to trigger the vulnerability. This would require the go-getter library to fetch from a source controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control of HTTP server:** An attacker must control the HTTP server from which the go-getter client attempts to download data. This could be a server specifically set up for malicious purposes or a compromised legitimate server.
*   **Ability to manipulate HTTP Headers:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP responses with malicious header content.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The severity of the vulnerability's impact is context-dependent. Server-side usage of go-getter is likely at greater risk than client-side use.
*   The provided text states that other issues were found which are related to path traversal, symlink processing, command injection, asymmetric resource exhaustion and a panic when processing password protected ZIP files but these do not seem related to CVE-2022-30322 and are probably due to the other CVEs referenced.
