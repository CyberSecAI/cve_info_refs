Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-30655:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-After-Free

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416)

**Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution

**Attack vectors:** The CVSS vector string "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H" indicates the following:
    -   **AV:L (Local):** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs local access to the vulnerable system.
    -   **AC:L (Low):** The attack complexity is low, implying that the vulnerability is easy to exploit.
    -   **PR:N (None):** No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability, so an unprivileged user could trigger it.
    -   **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required, so the user would need to perform some action like opening a malicious file.
    -   **S:U (Unchanged):** The security scope is unchanged, meaning the vulnerability only affects the vulnerable component.
    -  **C:H (High):** High impact on Confidentiality
    -  **I:H (High):** High impact on Integrity
    -  **A:H (High):** High impact on Availability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local access to the system and must convince a user to interact with a crafted file to exploit the vulnerability.
