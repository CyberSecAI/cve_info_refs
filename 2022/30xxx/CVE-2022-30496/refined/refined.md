Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability found in the login functionality of the IDCE - MV Medicina Diagn√≥stica software. Specifically, the vulnerability is located within the "user" input field.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The software fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection which means that the attacker cannot directly see the output of the SQL query, but can infer information based on the time it takes for the server to respond.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data within the database, including patient records, payment information, user credentials, and other confidential information.
- **Server Information Disclosure:** The attacker can retrieve server information, including the database type and version (Oracle on Windows 2008 R2), and database user and name.
- **Complete Database Access**: The attacker can potentially access all information within the database by extracting column names of tables.
- **Unauthorized Access**: With database access, an attacker may create, read, update or delete records in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The attack vector is the login form of the IDCE software. By injecting SQL code into the username field an attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerable software was accessible via the web, either locally or through the internet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. This could be from a local network, a VPN connection, or even directly from the internet if the software is publicly exposed.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:**  The attacker would need basic knowledge of SQL to inject malicious queries and extract data.
- **Use of tools like SQLMap:** The attacker can leverage tools like SQLMap to automate the SQL injection process.
