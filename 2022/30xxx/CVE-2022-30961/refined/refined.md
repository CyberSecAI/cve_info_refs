**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Autocomplete Parameter Plugin does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts into the parameter name or description. The malicious script will then execute when the parameter is displayed on a page, such as the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission. The attacker also needs to be able to view a page that renders parameters.
