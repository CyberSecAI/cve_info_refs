Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `TgaRleDecode.c` file, specifically in how Pillow decodes TGA files with Run-Length Encoding (RLE).
- The issue occurs when RLE packets cross scan lines. The decoder incorrectly reads data past the end of the first line without adjusting the remaining file data length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** Due to the incorrect handling of RLE packets spanning multiple scan lines, the decoder attempts to write beyond the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
- **Incorrect Length Handling:** The decoder does not properly account for already processed data when decoding RLE packets which leads to a mismatch in expected and actual data lengths.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap buffer overflow:** This can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting parts of the heap memory with attacker-controlled data. This can potentially lead to a denial of service, data corruption, or complete system compromise.
- **Unstable image processing**: The incorrect handling of data length may lead to unexpected application behavior when trying to decode a crafted TGA image

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the processing of a specially crafted TGA image file that contains RLE packets which cross scan lines.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious TGA image file to an application using Pillow.
- No special access to the target system is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Pillow version 9.1.0.
- It was fixed in version 9.1.1
