The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Merchandise Online Store v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `id` parameter at `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=maintenance/manage_sub_category`
- Lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as the database name.
- The content-length of the HTTP response changes based on the SQL query executed, allowing an attacker to infer information about the database.
- The vulnerability can likely be leveraged for full database compromise by escalating the SQLi to extract data, modify data or even execute commands on the underlying OS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP GET requests to the specified URL.
- The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL to inject SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=maintenance/manage_sub_category`.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability as it is accessible via the `id` GET parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting SQL code into the id parameter of the URL, such as: `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=maintenance/manage_sub_category&id=1' and length(database()) = 17--+`.
- The attacker uses blind SQL injection techniques by observing changes in the response content length to determine information about the database.
- The example shows how the attacker uses the length() function in SQL to determine the length of the database name, with different response sizes for correct/incorrect length.
