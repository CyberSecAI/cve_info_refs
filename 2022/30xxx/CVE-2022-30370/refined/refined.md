```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter when deleting cargo types.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `/acms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_cargo_type` endpoint. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious SQL queries, potentially allowing them to extract sensitive data, modify the database, or potentially gain control over the database server.  The provided payload demonstrates extracting the database name using the `updatexml` function.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/acms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_cargo_type`, with the malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application and must be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and the `id` parameter. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this particular vulnerability. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system."
