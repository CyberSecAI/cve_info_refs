Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an "exposed dangerous method" within the NCIE Scanner module of Trend Micro Internet Security. This module exposes a function that should not be accessible to unprivileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposed Dangerous Method:** A function within the NCIE Scanner module is accessible to unprivileged users, which it should not be. This allows attackers to interact with the function without proper authorization.
- **Information Disclosure:** The exposed method can leak kernel addresses and sensitive information.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** The information disclosure vulnerability can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to gain higher level access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can obtain sensitive information, including kernel addresses.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By chaining this vulnerability with others, an attacker could potentially elevate their privileges to kernel level or higher.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **Exploitation of Exposed Method:** The attacker leverages the exposed dangerous method in the NCIE Scanner module to leak information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Code Execution:** Attackers need the ability to run code with low privileges on the affected machine.
- **Access to the Vulnerable Module:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable NCIE Scanner module.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Trend Micro Security 2021 and 2022 (Consumer) for Windows.
- Trend Micro has released an update to address the issue via ActiveUpdate.
- The vulnerability was reported by an anonymous researcher working with the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- The CVSSv3 score is 6.5, indicating a medium severity.
