Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `package_edit.php` file, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `package_edit.php` script. Specifically, the `id` parameter is not being properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name in the example provided.
*  **Potential Full Database Compromise:** Depending on database privileges and system configurations, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or gain further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send crafted HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL:** The attacker requires knowledge of SQL to craft injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `admin\package_edit.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Example Payload:** `id=-1 union select 1,2,database(),4--+`
