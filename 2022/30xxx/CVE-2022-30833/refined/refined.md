The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Wedding Management System v1.0 by codeastro.com.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `user_id` parameter within the `/Wedding-Management/admin/client_edit.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the `user_id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information by injecting SQL queries. The example shows extraction of database name.
- Data Manipulation: While not directly demonstrated, SQL injection could potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the database.
- Privilege Escalation: If the application database contains user account information, the vulnerability could potentially be used to gain unauthorized administrative access to the system

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the `/Wedding-Management/admin/client_edit.php` endpoint, manipulating the `user_id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable endpoint and the name of the parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as no authentication is required for the attack to work.
