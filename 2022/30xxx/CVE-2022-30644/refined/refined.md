Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30644:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use After Free (CWE-416)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A Use-After-Free vulnerability is present, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring a user to open a malicious file, likely a crafted Illustrator file. The attack does not require any special privileges (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R). The vulnerability's scope is unchanged (S:U), meaning the attack does not affect other applications.
