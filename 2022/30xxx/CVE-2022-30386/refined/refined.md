The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Merchandise Online Store v1.0" application by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php` file, specifically within the `delete_featured` function. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this SQL injection vulnerability to perform a variety of malicious actions, such as:
*   Data exfiltration (e.g., leaking database name as demonstrated in the payload).
*   Data modification.
*   Data deletion.
*   Potentially, remote code execution, depending on database server configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP POST request to `/vloggers_merch/classes/Master.php?f=delete_featured`, where the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable URL with a crafted `id` parameter. No authentication seems necessary for this particular request. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.

The provided payload `id=5' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` is an example of an attacker attempting to exfiltrate database name by using the `updatexml` function to produce an error which outputs the database name, it also uses a comment `--+` to ignore the rest of the SQL query.
