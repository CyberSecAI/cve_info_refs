Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2022-30350 Analysis**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way PDF redaction tools handle text positioning information. Specifically, the tools often fail to remove or obfuscate sub-pixel-sized horizontal shifts in redacted and non-redacted characters. This positional information, along with character widths, can be used to infer the content of the redacted text.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Preservation of Glyph Positioning**: Many redaction tools preserve glyph positioning information, including character widths and sub-pixel shifts, even when the text itself is removed and replaced with a black rectangle.
    *   **Non-Excising Redactions**: Some tools simply overlay a black box over the text, leaving the original text data in the PDF document, making it vulnerable to copy-paste attacks.
    *   **Dependent Shifting Schemes:**  Microsoft Word's "Save as PDF" feature creates a dependent shifting scheme where non-redacted glyph shifts are influenced by the content of redacted glyphs. This leaks information that can be used for deredaction.
    *   **Width Equivalence Classes**: Even when character shifts are not present, the widths of characters can reveal information as some characters are identical in width, however, combining character shifts and widths increases the amount of leaked information.
    *   **Rasterization Issues**: Even when a document is rasterized, the width of redactions can often be approximated by the spacing between glyphs next to the redacted area.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Deredaction of Text**: Attackers can recover redacted text with a high degree of accuracy by analyzing leaked glyph positioning data. The attack is more effective when a candidate dictionary is available.
    *   **Privacy Violation**: Sensitive information that was intended to be protected by redaction is exposed.
    *   **Misinformation**: An attacker can change the redacted text to another valid word, potentially misinforming an adversary by lying about the content of the redaction.
    *   **Large Scale Impact**: The vulnerability affects numerous real-world documents, including legal documents, investigation reports, and FOIA responses.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Analysis of PDF Structure**: The attacker analyzes the PDF document structure to extract glyph positioning information (widths and shifts).
    *   **Dictionary Attack**: The attacker attempts to match strings from a dictionary of potential texts to the glyph positioning data in the redacted text.
    *   **Side-Channel Analysis**: In cases where the redaction is performed on the output of OCR software, side-channels such as character and word spacing operators can be used to infer the width of the redacted text.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Access to PDF Document**: The attacker needs access to the vulnerable PDF document.
    *   **Software for PDF Analysis**: The attacker requires a tool to analyze the PDF structure and extract glyph positioning data.
    *   **Dictionary**: Access to a dictionary or corpus of likely redacted texts improves the effectiveness of the attack.
    *   **Understanding of PDF Format**: Understanding the way text is rendered in PDF documents is also required to effectively exploit the vulnerability.
