Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in the Rescue Dispatch Management System. Specifically, low-privileged staff users can access administrative endpoints and perform actions intended only for administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system does not properly restrict access to administrative functionalities. Low-privileged users can access admin-only pages by directly navigating to the URL.
*   **Lack of Privilege Checks:** The system fails to verify the user's role before granting access to administrative actions such as changing the admin password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Admin Account Takeover:** An attacker with a low-privileged staff account can gain complete control of the administrator account by changing the administrator's password.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With administrator access, the attacker can potentially modify system data, user accounts, and other critical configurations, leading to a full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** By simply typing or navigating to administrative URLs (e.g., `http://localhost/rdms/admin/?page=user/list`), low-privileged users bypass access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Account:** The attacker needs only a valid low-privileged staff account on the Rescue Dispatch Management System.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to access the system's web interface (e.g., via a web browser).

**Additional details from the provided content:**
* The vulnerability was found in "Rescue Dispatch Management System 1.0".
* The system is a web-based application developed in PHP using a MySQL database.
* The exploit was tested on Kali Linux.
* The provided steps to reproduce the vulnerability include login as low privileged user, visiting any Admin Endpoint, and then changing admin password.
* Default admin credentials for the application are "admin" for the username and "admin123" for the password.
* There's a note that the source code was developed for educational purposes.
