# Prime95 Buffer Overflow (RCE)

Published on [April 25, 2022](https://mrvar0x.com/2022/04/)

Prime95 version 30.7 build 9 allows me to gain remote code execution on Windows, so Prime95 for Windows and Linux is a small and easy-to-use freeware application that allows you to find Mersenne Prime numbers designed for overclockers and has a feature called ‚ÄúTorture Test‚Äù that allows maximum stress testing on the CPU and RAM. You can download from [Here](https://www.mersenne.org/ftp_root/gimps/p95v307b9.win32.zip) The exploit was tested on Windows 7 Professional x86

**Bug Verification ‚Äì Fuzzing**

First, we need to verify the application is vulnerable and verify the crash.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/88.png)

So we have created a small python script that tends to print out the capital letter (A) 190 times and save on the desk, we name it (PFuzzer.py). We open the application.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-from-2022-04-26-10-09-39-1.png)

The program launches. as shown above.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screenshot-from-2022-04-26-10-11-36.png)

Then we select test- PrimeNet- check the square -connections then we paste the content of the output file that was generated from our script.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/33.png)

As we can see our program has been crashed | APPCRASH

**Observing the Crash**

Launch Immunity with Administrator privileges. In Immunity, click File, Open. Navigate to the program location then, we run the application under immunity,

we will repeat the crash and paste the same characters, to see what will happen under the immunity debugger

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/55-1024x543.png)

As we see above. In Immunity, at the bottom left, we can see ‚ÄúAccess violation when executing [41414141], [EIP register] which is the hexadecimal representation for AAAA.

**Controlling the EIP**

The next step is trying to see what is the exact number to reach out to EIP because we have sent many (A)‚Äôs and we don‚Äôt know which order we need to send to the exact location to perform the overwrite. and to achieve that we are going to use the metasploit module called pattern\_create.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/99.png)

We have created a Non-repeating pattern of 50 characters

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/100.png)

We created a new script called PPayload.py so we have sent (140) characters of (A) plus the unique pattern we created

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/101-1024x567.png)

As we the results EIP register has been filled with strange numbers, an access violation on 61413161.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/102.png)

We used another Metasploit module called pattern\_offset we copy the number 61413161, so ¬†we calculate the exact length of the buffer before writing into EIP we found the exact match at offset is [4] ¬†Then follow with the value of EIP that is based on the pattern and the length of the buffer.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/103.png)

As we mention the offset is [4], so we are going to create a script that contains (140 + 4) A‚Äôs and then add ‚ÄòB‚Äô \* 4 which is (42 42 42 42) in hex, and then we add ‚ÄòC‚Äô \* 100 after overwriting EIP.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/104-1024x577.png)

As we see in the image above EIP has overwritten with 42424242 our ‚ÄúB‚Äù and if we follow ESP in memory dump it points to our buffer (C‚Äôs).

**Jump Technique ‚Äì Shellcode**

Since we have controlled the EIP and we can point EIP to a place that contains our own (shellcode), how do we make the EIP jump to that location? Remember we have written the 144 (A‚Äôs) and written a new value on EIP and then we wrote many of (C‚Äôs). If we take a deep look at the previous image and examine the registers we will see ESP register points to (C‚Äôs) so we can put our shellcode instead of the (C‚Äôs) and make EIP go to that ESP address.

first, we will use the mona module to look for something with zero protection for Rebase, SafeSEH safe, ASLR..etc, so we going to use the mona command (!mona modules)

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/105-1024x540.png)

In our case, I chose the module libhwloc-15.dll, as it has all protections disabled and does not contain a NULL-byte within its base address. next, we need to find a jump esp address in one of these modules without any protection

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/106-1024x250.png)

As we see above we have used (mona jmp -r esp -m libhwloc-15.dll) ‚Äî> r for register and we got the address (0x66ee729d8)

**Building The Final Exploit**

First, we need to generate our shellcode, so I used Msfvenom to generate a shellcode of the calculator

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/107.png)

I have used sudo msfvenom -p windows/exec CMD=calc.exe -b ‚Äú\x00\x09\x0A\x0d‚Äù -f python -v payload and removed the bad characters. so let‚Äôs build our final exploit.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/108-1024x458.png)

As we see in the image above we put add a buffer (A) \* 144 we will fill the EIP with the address we got instead of (B‚Äôs) but we wrote in little Endian format (‚Äú\xd8\x29\xe7\x6e‚Äù) a couple of (nob) after the jump, then we put our shellcode.

![](https://mrvar0x.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/109-1024x505.png)

Bingo we have executed our shellcode successfully and calculator popup you can replace the calc shellcode with a reverse shell using msfvenom. You can download the exploit code from **[HERE](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50905)** ‚Äì CVE-2022-30055

##### About The Exploit Database

√ó

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as ‚ÄúGoogle Hacking‚Äù was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny‚Äôs talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term ‚ÄúGoogledork‚Äù to refer
to ‚Äúa foolish or inept person as revealed by Google‚Äú. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a ‚ÄúGoogle problem‚Äù but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term ‚Äúdork‚Äù became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and ‚Äúdorks‚Äù were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
