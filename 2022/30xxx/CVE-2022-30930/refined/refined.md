{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web application does not properly validate or include anti-CSRF tokens in HTML forms, allowing an attacker to trick a victim into making unintended requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick a victim into making a request the victim did not intend to make, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data modification, or other unwanted consequences.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious request (e.g., through a link or embedded form) that, when triggered by a logged-in victim's browser, performs an action on the vulnerable web application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious site or opening a malicious email with a forged request. The victim must also be logged into the target web application."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "HTML forms within the web application"
    ],
    "remediation": "Implement CSRF countermeasures such as anti-CSRF tokens. Verify that forms require anti-CSRF protection and if necessary add and validate a cryptographically secure unique per session token."
