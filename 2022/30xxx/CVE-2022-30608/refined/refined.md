- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The document does not specify the impact of successful exploitation, but CSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to induce users to perform unwanted actions on a web application.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not specify the attack vector, but CSRF attacks typically involve tricking a logged-in user into making unintended requests to a vulnerable web application through a malicious link or webpage.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not specify the exact capabilities, but an attacker would need to be able to induce a logged-in user to unknowingly make requests to the vulnerable application. This could potentially involve social engineering tactics.
