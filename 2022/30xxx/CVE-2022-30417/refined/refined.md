Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `/ctpms/admin/?page=user/manage_user` endpoint of the "Covid-19 Travel Pass Management System". The application directly uses this parameter in an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Leakage:** The attacker can use SQL injection techniques to retrieve sensitive database information, such as database name, table structures, and user credentials, as demonstrated by the provided examples.
*   **Potential for Full Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation can potentially lead to full database compromise, allowing the attacker to modify, delete, or add data as well as potentially executing arbitrary code on the database server in some cases.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **URL Parameter:** The vulnerable `id` parameter is passed within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Web Application Knowledge:** The attacker should be familiar with basic HTTP requests and URL manipulation.
*   **SQL Injection Knowledge:** The attacker needs a fundamental understanding of SQL injection techniques to construct malicious payloads.

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided examples demonstrate how an attacker can leak the database name by manipulating the `id` parameter using `length(database())` to measure the response length.
*   The default admin credentials (`admin/admin123`) are included, which could assist with further exploitation or access.
