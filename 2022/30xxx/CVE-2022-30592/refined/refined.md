  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "Root cause": "A NULL pointer dereference exists in the handshake process.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "NULL pointer dereference"
      ],
      "Impact": "A crash can occur due to the NULL pointer dereference during the handshake process.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the handshake process of the QUIC protocol.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to initiate a QUIC handshake with a vulnerable server."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "The library was not properly handling transport parameter max_table_capacity when it is set to less than 32.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of transport parameters"
      ],
      "Impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is not explicitly stated, but it could lead to unexpected behavior, handshake failure or possibly denial of service.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could send a QUIC handshake with a max_table_capacity less than 32.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to initiate a QUIC handshake with a vulnerable server and specify transport parameters."
    },
    {
        "Root cause": "0-RTT transport parameter validation was not implemented correctly, leading to potential issues.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect implementation of 0-RTT validation"
       ],
      "Impact": "This could lead to handshake failures or unexpected behavior. The exact impact is not stated.",
      "Attack vectors": "An attacker could attempt a 0-RTT handshake with invalid transport parameters.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Attacker needs to be able to initiate a 0-RTT handshake with a vulnerable server and manipulate transport parameters."
