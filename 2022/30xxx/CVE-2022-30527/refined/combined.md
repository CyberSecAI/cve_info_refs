GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-30527

The affected application assigns improper access rights to specific folders containing executable files
and libraries.

This could allow an authenticated local attacker to inject arbitrary code and escalate privileges.

CVSS v3.1 Base Score

CWE

7.8
CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource

Vulnerability CVE-2023-44315

The affected application improperly sanitizes certain SNMP configuration data retrieved from monitored
devices. An attacker with access to a monitored device could prepare a stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack that may lead to unintentional modification of application data by legitimate users.
