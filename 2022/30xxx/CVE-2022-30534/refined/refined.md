Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30534

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `chunkFile` parameter, which is directly used in a command executed by the `unzip` function. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands into the `unzip` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary OS commands through the `chunkFile` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the AVideo application.
- **Full System Compromise:**  The attacker could potentially gain full control of the server and access sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `/objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` endpoint.
- **`chunkFile` Parameter:** The malicious payload is injected via the `chunkFile` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the AVideo server.
- **Video Upload Permissions:** The attacker must have sufficient privileges on the AVideo platform to upload video content. This typically means a user account with permission to upload videos.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the `/objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` endpoint.
- **Ability to Manipulate Requests:** The attacker must be able to modify and send an HTTP request that includes the malicious payload in the `chunkFile` parameter and other required parameters like `resolution` and `format`.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` file of the AVideo application.
- The `chunkFile` parameter, intended to specify the temporary file path of an uploaded chunk, can be manipulated to inject arbitrary commands.
- The `unzipDirectory` function constructs the unzip command using the attacker-controlled `$filename` which is derived from the `chunkFile` parameter: `unzip {$filename} -d {$destination}`.
- By injecting a malicious filename containing shell commands, attackers can execute commands on the server when `exec($cmd)` is called.
- The provided PoC demonstrates command injection using a simple `id` command and redirecting the output to a file called `out`, which can then be accessed via a web request.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in WWBN AVideo 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364.
- The vendor has confirmed and fixed the vulnerability on July 7th, 2022.
