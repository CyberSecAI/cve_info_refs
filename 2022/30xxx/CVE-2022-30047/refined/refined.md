Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `orderBy` parameter within the `/mdiy/dict/listExcludeApp` route of Mingsoft MCMS. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** Specifically, a stacked SQL injection vulnerability exists. This means that an attacker can inject multiple SQL statements, separated by semicolons, into the query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the `orderBy` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive database information by querying system tables or other data.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, the ability to execute arbitrary SQL statements can sometimes lead to more severe consequences depending on the database system and its configuration. This can include the ability to execute operating system commands using certain database functions.
- **Denial of Service:** The example provided uses a `sleep(3)` function which could be used to cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the `/mdiy/dict/listExcludeApp` endpoint.
- **`orderBy` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected into the `orderBy` query string parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the URL endpoint `/mdiy/dict/listExcludeApp`
- **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax in order to exploit the injection point.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided curl command demonstrates the attack:
  ```
  curl -w "%{time_total}\n" -i -I -X $'GET' $'http://127.0.0.1:8080/mdiy/dict/listExcludeApp?dictType=1&orderBy=1;select/\*\*/if(substring((select/\*\*/database()),1,4)=\'mcms\',sleep(3),1);'
  ```
   - This command injects the following SQL: `1;select/**/if(substring((select/**/database()),1,4)='mcms',sleep(3),1);` into the `orderBy` parameter.
   - The injected code attempts to query the database name and use a conditional sleep function which introduces a time delay, proving the SQL injection.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was identified in Mingsoft MCMS v5.2.7.
- The issue is marked as resolved in the issue tracker and included in version 5.2.8.
- The exploit is performed at the frontend (unauthenticated) since it is not necessary to login.
