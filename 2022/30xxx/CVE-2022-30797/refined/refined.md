Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `vieworders.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without any filtering or escaping, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw, where an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code through the `id` parameter of the `vieworders.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name, user credentials, customer data, order details, and any other stored data.
- **Data Modification:**  Through SQL injection, it is also possible to modify existing data in the database.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by modifying data or causing database errors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP GET request to `vieworders.php` by manipulating the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
- **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `vieworders.php` file and the `id` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes an example payload used to identify the vulnerability: `/onlineordering/admin/vieworders.php?id=MM-MDE%27%20and%20length(database())%20=12--+`. This payload attempts to determine the length of the database name using a time-based SQL injection technique.
- The response of the application changes based on the `length(database())` value which indicates that the vulnerability is present. The content length changes depending on the condition.
- The backend login credentials of the application are revealed: `admin/admin`.
- Vulnerable file: `/onlineordering/admin/vieworders.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `id`
