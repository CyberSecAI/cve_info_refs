Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-30946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Script Security Plugin does not enforce the requirement for POST requests for a specific form validation endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a Jenkins user into sending an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled web server. This could potentially be used to leak information or perform actions on the victim's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
A malicious website, email, or other medium can be used to trick a logged-in Jenkins user's browser into sending a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in Jenkins user to visit a malicious page or click a link. No special Jenkins privileges are required beyond the victim being logged in.

**Additional Notes**
The vulnerability is present in Script Security Plugin versions 1158.v7c1b_73a_69a_08 and earlier.
The vulnerability is fixed in version 1172.v35f6a_0b_8207e, where the vulnerable form validation method no longer sends HTTP requests.
