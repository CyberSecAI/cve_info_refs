Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30115:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in how curl handles hostnames with trailing dots when using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). Curl's HSTS implementation stores and retrieves HSTS policies based on the hostname. However, the implementation fails to normalize hostnames, leading to a bypass. If a hostname is stored in the HSTS cache with a trailing dot (e.g., `example.com.`), a subsequent request to the same hostname without the trailing dot (e.g., `example.com`) will not be recognized as a match, and vice-versa. This causes curl to bypass HSTS and potentially use clear-text HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **HSTS Bypass:**  The core issue is a bypass of the HSTS mechanism, which is intended to enforce secure HTTPS connections.
- **Lack of Hostname Normalization:** The failure to normalize hostnames (specifically, the handling of trailing dots) leads to the bypass.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Cleartext Communication:**  An attacker can force a vulnerable curl client to communicate with a server using insecure HTTP even when the server has an HSTS policy that should enforce HTTPS.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** By forcing cleartext HTTP, an attacker can potentially intercept and modify traffic.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Cleartext communication can expose sensitive user data to eavesdropping.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Manipulated URLs:** An attacker can trick a user or application into using URLs with trailing dots (or without them, depending on how the HSTS cache is populated) to bypass HSTS.
- **HSTS Cache Poisoning:** In a scenario where an attacker can influence how the HSTS cache is populated (perhaps by first making the user connect to attacker-controlled infrastructure with a trailing-dot HSTS policy), they can then cause subsequent connections to the legitimate domain to bypass the HSTS policy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to influence the URL used by the curl client:** The attacker needs to be able to cause the curl client to send requests with a hostname that either includes or omits a trailing dot, depending on the state of the HSTS cache.
- **Optional: Ability to initially populate the HSTS cache with a specific trailing-dot version of a domain:**  This is not always required, as a simple URL manipulation can bypass the HSTS. However, this initial cache population could potentially widen the attack scope.

**Additional details:**

- This issue affects curl versions 7.82.0 to 7.83.0.
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `b27ad8e1d3e68e`, which changed the treatment of trailing dot hostnames.
- Similar issues have been found in other browsers like Firefox and Chrome.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-319 (Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information).
- The severity is rated as medium.
- The fix was implemented in commit `fae6fea209a2d4d`.
- A patch or upgrade to curl version 7.83.1 is recommended, or using HTTPS URLs always.
