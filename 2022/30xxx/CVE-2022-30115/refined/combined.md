## CVE-2022-30115

# HSTS bypass via trailing dot

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-30115.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using
HTTP.

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly
instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is
provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in
the given URL used a trailing dot while not using one when it built the
HSTS cache. Or the other way around - by having the trailing dot in the
HSTS cache and *not* using the trailing dot in the URL.

Since trailing dots in hostnames are somewhat special, many sites
work equally fine with or without a trailing dot present.

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in [commit
b27ad8e1d3e68e](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e), shipped in curl [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) when the treatment of
trailing dot hostnames was changed.

Similar issues have been raised in the past for [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2015-13/)
and for [Chrome](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=461481).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-30115 to this issue.

CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.82.0](vuln-7.82.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b27ad8e1d3e68e>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/fae6fea209a2d4d>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Stick to always using `HTTPS://` in URLs

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 3, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27781

# CERTINFO never-ending busy-loop

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27781.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl provides the `[CURLOPT_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html)` option to allow
applications to request details to be returned about a TLS server's
certificate chain.

Due to an erroneous function, a malicious server could make libcurl
built with NSS get stuck in a never-ending busy-loop when trying to
retrieve that information.

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in in curl [7.34.0](vuln-7.34.0.html) when libcurl added support
for `[CURLOPT_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html)` using NSS.

This feature is not accessible from the command line tool.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27781 to this issue.

CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')

Severity: Low

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.34.0](vuln-7.34.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.34.0](vuln-7.34.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f6c335d63f>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/5c7da89d404bf59>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

C - Do not use the `[CURLOPT_CERTINFO](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CERTINFO.html)` option

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 30, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the

Subject: curl: CVE-2022-43551: Another HSTS bypass via IDN

CVE-2022-43551: Another HSTS bypass via IDN
===========================================

Project curl Security Advisory, December 21 2022 -
[Permalink](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-43551.html>)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP.

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using
an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL.

The HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first
uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN
conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP)
instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E). Then in a subsequent request,
it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a clear text transfer. Because it
would store the info IDN encoded but look for it IDN decoded.

Reproducible like this:

     curl --hsts hsts.txt <https://curl>%E3%80%82se
     curl --hsts hsts.txt <http://curl>%E3%80%82se

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This flaw was introduced in [commit
7385610d0c7](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7>), which was
shipped enabled by default from [commit
d71ff2b9db566b3f](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d71ff2b9db566b3f>) in
curl 7.77.0.

This issue is similar to both the previous issues
[CVE-2022-42916](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-42916.html>) and
[CVE-2022-30115](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-30115.html>).

This became a new separate vulnerability simply because we did not properly
test and research related side-issues while we worked on fixing the previous
issues.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-43551 to this issue.

CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.77.0 to and including 7.86.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.77.0 and curl >= 7.86.0

curl built without IDN support is not vulnerable.

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

THE SOLUTION
------------

A [fix for CVE-2022-43551](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9e71901634e276dd>)

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

  A - Upgrade curl to version 7.87.0

  B - Apply the patch to your local version

  C - Stick to always using `HTTPS://` in URLs

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on October 29, 2022. We contacted
distros@...nwall on December 12, 2022.

curl 7.87.0 was released on December 21 2022, coordinated with the publication
of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27780

# percent-encoded path separator in URL host

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27780.html)

## VULNERABILITY

The curl URL parser wrongly accepts percent-encoded URL separators
like '/' when decoding the hostname part of a URL, making it a
*different* URL using the wrong hostname when it is later
retrieved.

For example, a URL like `http://example.com%2F10.0.0.1/`,
would be allowed by the parser and get transposed into
`http://example.com/10.0.0.1/`. This flaw can be used to
circumvent filters, checks and more.

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in [commit
9a8564a920188e](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9a8564a920188e), shipped in curl [7.80.0](vuln-7.80.0.html) when curl added support for
percent-encoded hostnames in URLs.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27780 to this issue.

CWE-177: Improper Handling of URL Encoding

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.80.0](vuln-7.80.0.html) to and including [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.83.0](vuln-7.83.0.html) and curl >= [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/9a8564a920188e>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The URL parser now rejects hostnames that percent-decode into URL
separator characters.

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/914aaab9153764e>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on April 28, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

Subject: [SECURITY ADVISORY] CVE-2022-42916: HSTS bypass via IDN (curl)

CVE-2022-42916: HSTS bypass via IDN
===================================

Project curl Security Advisory, October 26 2022 -
[Permalink](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-42916.html>)

VULNERABILITY
-------------

curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP.

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly instead
of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the
URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL uses
IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN
conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP)
instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.

Like this: `<http://curl>。se。`

We are not aware of any exploit of this flaw.

INFO
----

This flaw was introduced in [commit
7385610d0c7](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7>), which was
shipped enabled by default from [commit
d71ff2b9db566b3f](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d71ff2b9db566b3f>) in
curl 7.77.0.

This issue is similar to the previous [CVE-2022-30115](<https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-30115.html>).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
CVE-2022-42916 to this issue.

CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Severity: Medium

AFFECTED VERSIONS
-----------------

- Affected versions: curl 7.77.0 to and including 7.85.0
- Not affected versions: curl < 7.77.0 and curl >= 7.86.0

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

THE SOLUTION
------------

A [fix for CVE-2022-42916](<https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/53bcf55b4538067e6>)

RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------

  A - Upgrade curl to version 7.86.0

  B - Apply the patch to your local version

  C - Stick to always using `HTTPS://` in URLs

TIMELINE
--------

This issue was reported to the curl project on October 11, 2022. We contacted
distros@...nwall on October 18, 2022.

libcurl 7.86.0 was released on October 26 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-27782

# TLS and SSH connection too eager reuse

Project curl Security Advisory, May 11 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-27782.html)

## VULNERABILITY

libcurl would reuse a previously created connection even when a TLS
or SSH related option had been changed that should have prohibited
reuse.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequent transfers to reuse if one of them matches the setup. However,
several TLS and SSH settings were left out from the configuration match
checks, making them match too easily.

## INFO

Here are the list of options that were not considered in the check,
so curl would reuse a connection even if the subsequent transfer would
have changed one or more of these options.

### TLS options

* `[CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS.html)` (since [7.25.0](vuln-7.25.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_CRLFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_CRLFILE.html)` (since [7.19.0](vuln-7.19.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_USERNAME.html)` (since [7.21.4](vuln-7.21.4.html))
* `[CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD.html)` (since [7.21.4](vuln-7.21.4.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_CRLFILE.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_USERNAME](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_USERNAME.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))
* `[CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_PROXY_TLSAUTH_PASSWORD.html)` (since [7.52.0](vuln-7.52.0.html))

### SSH options

* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEYFILE.html)` (since [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html))
* `[CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEYFILE.html)` (since [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html))

This flaw was initially introduced in curl [7.16.1](vuln-7.16.1.html) and has been
widened several times since then. See table above for details

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-27782 to this issue.

CWE-305: Authentication Bypass by Primary Weakness

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

The two patches for CVE-2022-27782: [TLS-fix](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/f18af4f874) and [SSH-fix](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/1645e9b44505abd5cbaf65da5282c3f33b5924a5)

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/1645e9b44505abd5cbaf65d>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version

## TIMELINE

This issue was reported to the curl project on May 1, 2022. We
contacted distros@openwall on May 5.

libcurl [7.83.1](vuln-7.83.1.html) was released on May 11 2022, coordinated with the
publication of this advisory.

## CVE-2022-42916

# HSTS bypass via IDN

Project curl Security Advisory, October 26 2022 - [Permalink](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-42916.html)

## VULNERABILITY

curl's HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it to keep using
HTTP.

Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS directly
instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is
provided in the URL. This mechanism could be bypassed if the hostname in
the given URL uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII
counterparts as part of the IDN conversion. Like using the character
UTF-8 U+3002 (`IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP`) instead of the common
ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`.

Like this: `http://curlãseã`

## INFO

This flaw was introduced in [commit
7385610d0c7](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7), which was shipped enabled by default from [commit
d71ff2b9db566b3f](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/d71ff2b9db566b3f) in curl [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html).

This issue is similar to the previous [CVE-2022-30115](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2022-30115.html).

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
the name CVE-2022-42916 to this issue.

CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information

Severity: Medium

## AFFECTED VERSIONS

* Affected versions: curl [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html) to and including [7.85.0](vuln-7.85.0.html)
* Not affected versions: curl < [7.77.0](vuln-7.77.0.html) and curl >= [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html)
* Introduced-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c7>

libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as
such!

## SOLUTION

* Fixed-in: <https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/53bcf55b4538067e6>

## RECOMMENDATIONS

A - Upgrade curl to version [7.86.0](vuln-7.86.0.html)

B - Apply the patch to your local version
