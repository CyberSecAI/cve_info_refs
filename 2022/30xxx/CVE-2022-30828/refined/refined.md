The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Wedding Management System v1.0 by codeastro.com.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `photos_edit.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection vulnerability in `admin\photos\_edit.php` via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (e.g., reading sensitive data).
    *   Data manipulation (e.g., modifying or deleting data).
    *   Complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious SQL payload within the `id` parameter of the `photos_edit.php` file.
*   The attacker needs to send an HTTP GET request containing the malicious SQL payload to `/Wedding-Management/admin/photos_edit.php?id=`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No specific user privileges are mentioned; an unauthenticated attacker can likely trigger the vulnerability.
