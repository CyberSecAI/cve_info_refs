Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30533

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Affected Product:** WordPress Plugin "Modern Events Calendar Lite" prior to version 6.3.0

**Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting. This means that malicious scripts can be injected into the plugin's database or settings, and these scripts will then be executed when a user interacts with the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data before storing it, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary Script Execution: If successfully exploited, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when they are accessing the website using the plugin.
*   Malicious Actions: This can lead to a range of malicious actions, including but not limited to:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies/session data)
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Credential theft (if the user interacts with fake login forms)

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is network-based (AV:N)
*   The vulnerability can be exploited with low attack complexity (AC:L)
*   Privileges Required: Low privileged user can exploit it (PR:L)
*   User Interaction: The user must interact with the malicious content (UI:R)
*   Scope: The scope of the attack is changed (S:C).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious script into a field or setting of the Modern Events Calendar Lite plugin, accessible through the WordPress admin interface, or a vulnerable form on the front end.
*   They need to have at least low privileged access in order to inject the malicious script

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as stored XSS, which is more dangerous than reflected XSS as it can affect a larger number of users.
*   The provided CVSS v3 score is 5.4, indicating a medium severity.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Tsutomu Aramaki of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.

**Solution:**
*   Update the plugin to version 6.3.0 or later, as this contains the fix for the vulnerability.
