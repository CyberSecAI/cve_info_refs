{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a result of insufficient input sanitization, leading to reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a low attack complexity (AC:L), a low privilege user (PR:L) and user interaction(UI:R)",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts in a way that will be reflected to the victim through user interaction with the application. A low privileged user is required."
