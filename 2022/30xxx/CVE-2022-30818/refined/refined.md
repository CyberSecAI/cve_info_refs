    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database, modify data, or perform other malicious actions depending on the database privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `user_id` parameter in a GET request to `/Wedding-Management/admin/client_edit.php`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and have some basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques to exploit the vulnerability."

    "exploit_details": "The provided proof of concept uses a time-based SQL injection technique to determine the length of the database name by observing changes in response length. The payload `user_id=31 and length(database())=9` is used to confirm that the database name length is 9 characters. The attacker can further exploit this vulnerability to extract data, modify data, or perform other database operations.",
