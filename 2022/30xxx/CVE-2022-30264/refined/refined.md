Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient verification of data authenticity in the Emerson ROC800, ROC800L and DL8000 devices when using the ROC protocol for communications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity (CWE-345):** The devices do not properly verify the authenticity of data received via the ROC protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, write, and delete files or folders on the affected devices.
*   This file manipulation could lead to disruption of industrial processes, potential safety issues, and other operational problems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the ROC protocol, which is used for communications with the affected devices.
*   The advisory states that this vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need local access to the network where the affected devices are located.
*   The attacker would need high privileges on the device.
*   The attacker would require user interaction
*   The attack complexity is high.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities detailed in the "OT:ICEFALL" report.
*   The affected devices are used in multiple critical infrastructure sectors worldwide.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.3, with the vector string of AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
*   No public exploits are known to specifically target this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to CISA by Daniel dos Santos and Jos Wetzels from Forescout Technologies.
