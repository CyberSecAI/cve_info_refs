Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30114:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `cmproxy` executable of Fastweb FASTGate home routers. This is due to the lack of validation of the length of the 'Authorization' HTTP header value received by the web service on TCP port 8888.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `cmproxy` application copies the 'Authorization' header value using `strcpy` into a fixed-size buffer (100 bytes) located in the `.bss` section without any bounds checking. This allows an attacker to overwrite heap memory by sending a header longer than 100 bytes.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable service is exposed on both the LAN and WAN interfaces of the device, allowing unauthenticated remote attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an overly long 'Authorization' header, an attacker can corrupt the heap memory, causing the `cmproxy` process to crash. This leads to a device reboot, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While the primary impact is a crash, the document mentions the possibility of overwriting heap structures to achieve code execution with further analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network (both WAN and LAN) by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device, either on the LAN or WAN side.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.
- **HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with a specific header.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable service listens on TCP port 8888 and uses HTTPS.
- The `cmproxy` application handles HTTP requests via a Lighttpd FastCGI webserver.
- The vulnerability affects specific versions of Technicolor MediaAccess FGA2130FWB (GPON) and DGA4131FWB (VDSL2) models.
- A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit using Python is provided in the document.
- The vendor has reportedly disabled WAN access as a mitigative control but the service remains accessible on the internal LAN.
