{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Nokia G-2425G-A home WiFi router's web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'Host Alias' field under 'admin->Maintenance>Device Management', leading to stored XSS vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they access the router's management interface. This allows the attacker to steal cookies, deface the web application, or redirect users to phishing pages.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects a malicious payload into the 'Host Alias' field located under 'admin->Maintenance>Device Management'. This payload is then stored by the router and executed each time a user visits this management page.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web interface as an administrator."
