The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Simple Social Networking Site v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/sns/admin/members/view_member.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the database, in this case, the database name.
- More advanced exploitation could allow the attacker to modify or delete data, or potentially gain control of the database server, depending on database privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL `/sns/admin/members/view_member.php?id=`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate the `id` parameter.
- An attacker would require access to the admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.
