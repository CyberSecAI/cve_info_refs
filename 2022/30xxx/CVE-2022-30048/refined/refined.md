Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30048 (Note: The provided content does not explicitly state this CVE ID, but it's strongly implied due to the issue description and the date)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/mdiy/dict/list` route of Mingsoft MCMS v5.2.7.
- Specifically, the `orderBy` parameter within this route is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stacked SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows for the injection of multiple SQL statements, not just within a `WHERE` clause.
- **Unsanitized Input:** The `orderBy` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Database Manipulation:** Attackers may be able to modify or delete data.
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary SQL statements could lead to a complete compromise of the database and potentially the server.
- **Information Disclosure:** The provided example demonstrates how to extract database information using `select database()`.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can use the `sleep()` function, as demonstrated, to cause delays.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious GET request to the `/mdiy/dict/list` route.
- **`orderBy` Parameter Manipulation:**  The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `orderBy` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required (Front-end Vulnerability):** The vulnerability is present on a front-end route, meaning that no prior authentication or login is required to exploit it.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided `curl` command is a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the SQL injection:
   ```bash
   curl -w "%{time_total}\n" -i -I -X $'GET' $'http://127.0.0.1:8080/mdiy/dict/list?dictType=1&orderBy=1)a;select/\*\*/if(substring((select/\*\*/database()),1,4)=\'mcms\',sleep(3),1);'
   ```
- This command injects `1)a;select/**/if(substring((select/**/database()),1,4)='mcms',sleep(3),1);` into the `orderBy` parameter, which results in a stacked SQL injection.
- The `sleep(3)` function is used to create a time delay which indicates that the SQL injection was successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported on Gitee as #I54VG0 and has been marked as resolved in version 5.2.8.
- The vulnerability is flagged by Gitee as a "Content Risk Flag" due to containing sensitive information like code security bugs.
