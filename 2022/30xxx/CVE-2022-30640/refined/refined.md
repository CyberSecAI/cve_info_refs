The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30640.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. This occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This could allow an attacker to run malicious code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction to trigger the vulnerability (e.g., by opening a specially crafted file in Adobe Illustrator). The attack complexity is low.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to entice the victim to open a malicious file using Adobe Illustrator. No special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability (PR:N).
