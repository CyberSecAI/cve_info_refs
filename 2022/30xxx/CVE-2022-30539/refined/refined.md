Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-30539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Use-after-free in the BIOS firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   A use-after-free condition exists in the BIOS firmware. This means that the code attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Escalation of Privilege: A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to gain higher privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have privileged access to the system.
*   The attacker must be able to execute code that triggers the use-after-free vulnerability.
