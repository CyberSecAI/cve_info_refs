- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. This means that malicious script can be stored within the application, and then executed when a user views the affected content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS), CWE-79
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires low attack complexity (AC:L). An attacker with low privileges (PR:L) can inject malicious script which is then executed in the context of the victim's session. Exploitation requires no user interaction (UI:N). The vulnerability has a scope change (S:C)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs low privileges on the application to inject the malicious script.
