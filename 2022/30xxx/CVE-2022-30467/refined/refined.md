{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the ebike's failure to properly validate or handle replayed unlock/drive commands from the key fob. Specifically, after an unlock command is replayed, the ebike denies subsequent lock requests from the legitimate key fob.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary weakness is the lack of replay protection for the unlock/drive command. The system does not implement sufficient mechanisms to detect and reject replayed signals, allowing an attacker to unlock the vehicle using a previously captured command. Additionally, the inability to lock the vehicle after a replayed unlock command is a vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to unlock and potentially drive the ebike without authorization, and then prevent it from being locked using the key fob. This poses a security risk, allowing for theft or unauthorized use of the ebike. The inability to lock the ebike can make it more vulnerable to further attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is wireless replay attack. An attacker uses a Hackrf with antenna to sniff the unlock/drive command from the key fob. This captured command is then replayed to unlock the ebike.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in close proximity to the key fob to intercept the initial unlock/drive signal. Additionally, they require a Hackrf (or similar device) capable of capturing and replaying 433.92 MHz signals. Some technical skills are needed to operate the Hackrf and replay the captured signal."
