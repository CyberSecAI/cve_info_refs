The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30617.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Sensitive data, specifically email addresses and password reset tokens of other admin panel users, are disclosed in JSON responses due to relationships (e.g., created by, updated by) with content accessible to the authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive data exposure in JSON responses
- Inadequate access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can view sensitive data (emails, password reset tokens) of other admin panel users.
- Account compromise of other admin panel users through the password reset workflow.
- Potential full control over the Strapi instance if a low-privileged user compromises a super admin account. This includes the ability to read and modify data, as well as block access to the admin panel and API by revoking privileges for other users.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access to the Strapi admin panel.
- Exploiting the disclosure of sensitive data in JSON responses when viewing content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user with access to the Strapi admin panel.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges. Even a low-privileged user can exploit the vulnerability.
