Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30772

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the PnpSmm driver, specifically within function 0x52. This function is responsible for writing data into the SMBIOS table. The issue stems from the lack of proper validation of the input address provided to this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The PnpSmm driver does not adequately validate the address provided for writing to the SMBIOS table.
- **Uncontrolled Memory Write:**  Malicious manipulation of the input address allows writing data to arbitrary memory locations, including SMRAM or OS kernel memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Memory Overwrite:** Attackers can overwrite critical areas of memory such as SMRAM (System Management RAM) or OS kernel memory.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Overwriting SMRAM can lead to privilege escalation by allowing the attacker to execute code within the System Management Mode.
- **System Instability/Compromise:** Overwriting OS kernel memory can result in system crashes or allow the attacker to gain full control of the operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malware Execution:** Malicious software or code running with sufficient privileges on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privileges:** The attacker must have high privileges on the system to be able to manipulate the PnpSmm driver and its functions. This likely involves exploiting a different vulnerability for the initial access.
- **Knowledge of System Internals:** The attacker would need some knowledge of the system's memory map to target SMRAM or other areas for malicious purposes.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered internally by Insyde during a security review.
- The provided document specifies the fix versions for different kernel versions of InsydeH2O UEFI Firmware.
- CVSS score of 7.2 is provided: AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H.
