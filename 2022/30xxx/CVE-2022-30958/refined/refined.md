### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in SSH Plugin allow capturing credentials

**SECURITY-2093 / CVE-2022-30958 (CSRF), CVE-2022-30959 (permission check)**

**Affected plugin:** `ssh`

**Description:**

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The SSH plugin does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.
    *   **CSRF vulnerability:** This endpoint does not require POST requests, leading to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vector:**
    *   The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP endpoint in the SSH Plugin.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to know valid credential IDs, which can be obtained through another vulnerability (CVE-2022-30957)
    *   The attacker must be able to induce the victim to visit a crafted webpage or make the HTTP request directly.
    *   The attacker needs an SSH server to connect to.
