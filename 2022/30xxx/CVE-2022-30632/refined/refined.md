Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Uncontrolled recursion in the `Glob` function within the `path/filepath` package of the Go programming language.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `Glob` function does not limit the number of path separators it can handle, leading to excessive recursion when processing paths with many separators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack exhaustion, causing a panic (crash) of the application.
- Denial of service, as the vulnerable application will terminate abruptly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Providing a path containing a large number of path separators to the `Glob` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input path passed to the `Glob` function. This could be through user-supplied input, configuration files, or other means where the attacker can manipulate the path string.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability affects Go versions before 1.17.12 and 1.18.4.
- The fix involves adding a limit to the number of path separators allowed in the input path.
- The issue was reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.
- A patch has been implemented in commit `ac68c6c683409f98250d34ad282b9e1b0c9095ef`.
- The vulnerability is tracked as Go issue #53416.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-674 (Improper Handling of Recursion).
