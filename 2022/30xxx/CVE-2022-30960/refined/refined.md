**CVE-2022-30960**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Application Detector Plugin, along with several other plugins, does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when a user views a page where the parameter is displayed, such as the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages. This could lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission can configure a job with a parameter that has malicious script in its name or description.
    *   When a user visits a page that displays the parameter, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must have `Item/Configure` permission.
    *   The attacker must be able to configure a job with a malicious parameter.
    *   A victim must view a page where the parameter is displayed (e.g., the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" page).
    *   Pages that display these parameters must not be hardened against XSS attacks (Jenkins core has been hardened since versions 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2).

The advisory also mentions that Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.

The following plugins are also affected by the same vulnerability: Autocomplete Parameter, Global Variable String Parameter, JDK Parameter, Multiselect parameter, Promoted Builds (Simple), Random String Parameter, Selection tasks, and vboxwrapper Plugins.

The Application Detector Plugin has been fixed in version 1.0.9.
