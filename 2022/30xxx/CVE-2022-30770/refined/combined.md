CVE-2022-30770 – TerminalFour Unauthenticated Reflected
Cross-Site Scripting on the Admin Interface

Summary

Editor: TerminalFour

Product: TerminalFour “Digital Engagement & Web Content Platform”

Title: TerminalFour Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting on the Admin Interface

CVE ID: CVE-2022-30770

Bulletproof ID: BSI-2022-01

Risk level: Medium to High

Exploitable: Remotely, User interaction is required.

Impact: Privilege escalation from unauthenticated user to administrator if user interaction is successful.

Description

This vulnerability affects the  TerminalFour CMS redirect mechanism on the administration interface. TerminalFour CMS is
used by numerous Universities across the world to create their portal.

A Reflected Cross Site Scripting vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker to mislead an administrator and steal their
credentials.

A  silent  redirection  to  an  attacker-controlled  interface  Proof-of-Concept  (PoC)  is  available  in  the  “Exploitation  details”
section.

Versions affected

The vulnerability was detected on version 8.3.7.

Terminalfour 8.3.x versions prior to version 8.3.8 are vulnerable

Terminalfour 8.2.x versions prior to version 8.2.18.5 or 8.2.18.2.1 are vulnerable.

The release notes for version 8.3.8, 8.2.18.5 and 8.2.18.2.1 contain updated references to this cross-site scripting vulnerability
(RDSM-31817).

Solutions

For existing installations of Terminalfour 8.3.x, upgrade Terminalfour to version 8.3.8 or later.

For existing installations of Terminalfour 8.2.x, the upgrade path will depend on the client’s use of workflows. Current patches
are 8.2.18.2.1 and 8.2.18.6. Terminalfour Client Support will advise clients on the best upgrade path for their circumstance.

NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30770

Exploitation Details

The  tested  version  (8.3.7) of the  application TerminalFour  was  prone to an unauthenticated reflected cross-site  scripting
(XSS) using a link with the following simple proof-of-concept code:

•  https://vulnerable.terminalfour.net/terminalfour/test'-alert('XSS-Bulletproof')-'test

Exhibit 1 – XSS execution using a TerminalFour URL

For public usage

Page 2 / 4

The part of the URI after "/terminalfour/" is not correctly filtered/escaped before being processed:

Exhibit 2 – URI not filtered before being reused

An attacker could try to mislead users using phishing techniques to impersonate the login page. This vulnerability is critical
since it is on the login page and it is exploitable without authentication.

The Bulletproof tester was able to demonstrate such a scenario with the following vector taking advantage of the JavaScript
injection to replace the URL targeted by the original JavaScript redirection where the injection is taking place:

•  https://vulnerable.terminalfour.net/terminalfour/'.replace('vulnerable.terminalfour.net','www.bulletproofsi.com')+'

Following the above link, the response page will look like this:

Exhibit 3 – Response page following the trapped link

The JavaScript code will execute in the browser and replace “vulnerable.terminalfour.net” by “www.bulletproofsi.com” in the
URL used by the original JavaScript redirection (cf. “window.location” in JavaScript). The mislead victim is then redirected to:

•  https://www.bulletproofsi.com/terminalfour/login.jsp?continue=/

Note: the URI "/terminalfour/login.jsp?/continue=/" does not currently exist on the website "www.bulletproofsi.com"
(HTTP 404), but a malicious actor can easily create a malicious application replicating a fake TerminalFour login page
on this kind of URI that could be used to harvest user or administrator credentials.

# Terminalfour: 8.3.8

Date Released:
February 15 2021

## General

### Workflows

We received feedback about [Workflow](/documentation/administration/user-rights--roles/workflow/) issues with multi-lingual Content Items, errors around rejection steps, and email functionality taking longer than it should. This release has over 20 fixes in place around the workflow functionality which should hopefully make things run smoother there.

#### A couple of highlights:

**RDSM-29134**

Approving Content Items in a Section Workflow configured to notify step moderators could be very slow. We've improved this by changing how those emails are queued and sent.

**RDSM-31244**

Previously if you modified and saved a Content Item where the reject settings were set to "Do nothing" and it had been already rejected in a Workflow, the Content Item did not re-enter or show up in the Workflow. That's fixed up now.

**RDSM-31306**

There were problems with rejecting independent Media Items that entered a Workflow. This has been resolved now.

### Performance

**Moving mirrored sections - RDSM-25970**

As always we're still finding performance gains with each release. For this release our performance piece was around the time it takes to move a Mirrored Section. At a large scale (e.g. over 7000 Child Sections) this was very slow. With this update, the same action takes about 30% of the previous time, a welcome improvement.

## Fixes of note

**Accessibility and anchor tags - RDSM-31347**

We made some adjustments to the [meta\_anchor T4 Tag](/documentation/page-management/generate-t4-tags/metadata/#d.en.36071) with this release. Previously that tag would output an `<a>` tag like this:

```
<a id="d.en.10743"></a>
```

From an accessibility perspective, this isn't great –  it's not a link and it's not going anywhere – so we changed it from an `<a>` tag to a`<span>`. The linking functionality will work the same but the markup is better.

**Duplicating/mirroring/moving content to a Section, content ordering is lost - RDSM-28606**

As part of this release, we took a look at what is happening with ordering when content is mirrored/moved/duplicated. There were a few idiosyncrasies that we have ironed out now. For a view on the expected functionality see [the new documentation.](/documentation/managing-content/merging-content-items-into-a-target-section/)

**Translating a List into another language - RDSM-26130**

When you tried to translate a List you could end up on a blank screen. We had a workaround but it wasn't user-friendly, so we've fixed the problem and you should be able to translate lists again.

**Group names over 40 characters - RDSM-32481**

Up until now, Group names had to be under 40 characters. Now that's configurable from the database if it needs to be longer.

**Content Syncer and extended user content type - RDSM-32242**

We spotted a problem where the Content Syncer functionality was being blocked if the system had an extended user Content Type set. That's been fixed up now.

**Inactive Content Items that are made pending publish - RDSM-14098**

This is an issue that's worth keeping an eye out for as it's been around for a while and may change current publish behavior on some older pages (albeit incorrect behavior). In this scenario, we've seen that content that was made inactive, then updated to be pending (not approved) could be published. We've put a fix in so in this situation only approved content will be published.
