The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30401.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the Merchandise Online Store v1.0 application. The application is vulnerable because it does not properly sanitize the `id` parameter in the `/vloggers_merch/?p=view_product` endpoint before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to the unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference: The `id` parameter can be manipulated to potentially access or modify data that the user should not have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive database information such as the database name, table names, user details, etc.
- Data modification: The attacker could potentially modify or delete database content.
- Complete system compromise: In severe cases, if the database user has sufficient privileges, the attacker may gain full control over the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted GET requests to the `/vloggers_merch/?p=view_product` endpoint.
- The `id` parameter within the URL is the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- They need a basic understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details**
- The provided markdown file from the github repository shows the following successful payload: `/vloggers_merch/?p=view_product&id=a87ff679a2f3e71d9181a67b7542122c%27%20and%20length(database())%20=17--+`
- The attacker uses `length(database()) = 17` to confirm that the database name is 'vloggers\_merch\_db'
- The response body length changes based on the injected SQL query, confirming the SQLi.
- The SQL injection is in the `id` parameter of the URL
