The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30956.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Rundeck Plugin does not restrict URL schemes in Rundeck webhook submissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of URLs in webhook payloads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts via crafted Rundeck webhook payloads that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies or redirecting the user to malicious websites, and can lead to full compromise of the Jenkins instance, potentially allowing for remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
Crafted Rundeck webhook payloads with malicious URLs are submitted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to submit crafted Rundeck webhook payloads, which requires at least Job/Configure permissions. They must also be able to trick a user into viewing a page where the malicious XSS payload is executed.

**Additional Information:**
The vulnerability is fixed in Rundeck Plugin version 3.6.11, which sanitizes URLs in webhook payloads.
