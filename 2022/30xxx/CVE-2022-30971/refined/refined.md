The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30971.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Storable Configs Plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability: The plugin's XML parser is vulnerable to XXE attacks due to improper configuration.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The HTTP endpoint calling the XML parser does not require POST requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XXE:** Attackers with `Item/Configure` permission can have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities, leading to extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.
- **CSRF:**  An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability in conjunction with the XXE vulnerability to trigger the parsing of a crafted XML document.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have `Item/Configure` permission to exploit the XXE and CSRF vulnerabilities.
- The attacker can craft a malicious XML file with external entities and use the vulnerable endpoint to trigger the parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have `Item/Configure` permissions.
- The attacker needs the ability to make HTTP requests to the Jenkins server
