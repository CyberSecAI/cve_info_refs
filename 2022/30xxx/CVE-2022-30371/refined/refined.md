Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `id` parameter in the `/acms/admin/cargo_types/view_cargo_type.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection because user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
  -  Lack of input sanitization: The application directly incorporates the `id` parameter from the URL into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterized queries.
   -  SQL Injection: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  -  Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive database information, such as the database name, table structures, and user data.
  -  Data manipulation: An attacker can modify data stored in the database.
  -  Potential for complete compromise: Depending on the privileges of the database user and underlying system, successful SQL injection attacks could lead to full system compromise.
  -  Demonstrated successful database name extraction.

**Attack Vectors:**
  -  HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/acms/admin/cargo_types/view_cargo_type.php` endpoint.
  -  URL parameter manipulation: The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter of the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
 - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
 - The attacker does not need to be logged in or authenticated based on the information given.

**Technical Details**
   - Vulnerable file: `/acms/admin/cargo_types/view_cargo_type.php`
   - Vulnerable parameter: `id`
   - Example payload: `/acms/admin/cargo_types/view_cargo_type.php?id=2%27%20and%20length(database())%20=7%20--+`
   - The attacker can infer the length of the database name by checking the response content-length. When the length comparison in the SQL injection is correct, there will be a different response.
   - The database name is `acms_db`
