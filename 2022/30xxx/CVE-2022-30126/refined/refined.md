Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a regular expression within the `StandardsText` class in Apache Tika, which is used by the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`.
- This regular expression is susceptible to backtracking, which can be triggered by a specially crafted input file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Regex Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The inefficient regular expression can cause excessive backtracking, leading to high CPU usage and potentially rendering the service unresponsive.
- **Non-Standard Handler:** The vulnerability affects users who are specifically utilizing the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`, which is a non-default handler.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit can cause a denial of service, making the application or service that uses the affected component unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted file through the vulnerable component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted input file that triggers the excessive backtracking in the regular expression.
- This means that the attacker needs to be able to submit input to a service which then uses the Tika library, specifically with the vulnerable configuration.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Apache Tika versions prior to 1.28.2 and 2.4.0.
- Fixes are available in versions 1.28.2, 1.28.3, 1.28.4, 2.4.0 and 2.4.1.
- It was discovered by the CodeQL team members [@atorralba](https://github.com/atorralba) and [@joefarebrother](https://github.com/joefarebrother).
- It affects users who use the non-standard `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`.
- Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Tika but are not affected by this specific vulnerability.
- The initial fix in 1.28.2 was incomplete, leading to the discovery of a new ReDoS vulnerability. This is addressed in versions 1.28.4 and 2.4.1.
