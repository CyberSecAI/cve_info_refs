of Industrial Controllers

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 6.5

2022-11-08

SUMMARY

The web server login page of affected products does not apply proper origin checking. This could allow
authenticated remote attackers to track the activities of other users via a login cross-site request forgery
attack..

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not access the product’s web service via URLs coming from untrusted sources
• Disable the web server if possible

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC PC Station is a software component that manages the SIMATIC software products and interfaces
on a PC.

SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 ODK CPUs provide functionality of standard S7-1500 CPUs but additionally provide
the possibility to run C/C++ Code within the CPU-Runtime for execution of own functions / algorithms
implemented in C/C++. They have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-300 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives. Includes
full network access to simulate the PLCs, even in virtualized environments.

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and
monitoring of machines and plants.

SINUMERIK ONE is a digital-native CNC system with an integrated SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU for automa-
tion.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-30694

The login endpoint /FormLogin in affected web services does not apply proper origin checking.

This could allow authenticated remote attackers to track the activities of other users via a login
cross-site request forgery attack.
