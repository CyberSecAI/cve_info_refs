- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web server login page of affected products does not properly check the origin of requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on the web server login page. Specifically, the `/FormLogin` endpoint lacks proper origin checking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially track the activities of other users by tricking them into making requests to the login page through a CSRF attack. This could lead to unauthorized access or tracking of user actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability via a cross-site request forgery attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote, but the attack requires the user to interact with a crafted malicious request (User Interaction: Required).

The advisory provides a detailed list of affected products and their respective vulnerable versions, along with links to updates and specific workarounds. It also mentions that for some products, no fix is currently planned.
