The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30962.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Global Variable String Parameter Plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter type it provides.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they view the job configuration or build pages. This can lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious script into the name or description of the Global Variable String Parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs Item/Configure permission to configure a Jenkins job or other item that uses a vulnerable parameter type and that displays the parameter names and descriptions to other users. This could be on the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages, which, if not hardened, will display the injected script.
