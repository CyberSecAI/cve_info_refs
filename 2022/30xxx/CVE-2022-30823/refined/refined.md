The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Wedding Management System v1.0 by codeastro.com.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `blog_events_edit.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the attacker is able to extract the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query within the `id` parameter of the URL in a GET request to `admin/blog_events_edit.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement to exploit this specific vulnerability. The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL structure (`/Wedding-Management/admin/blog_events_edit.php`) and the name of the parameter to inject (`id`).
