Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is an unvalidated `id` parameter within the Toll Tax Management System, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. This is evident from the provided payloads that inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter.
*   **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize or properly validate user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter, before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Administrator Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially gain complete control of the administrator account, allowing full control over the system.
*   **Full System Control:** The attacker can extend their access to all accounts within the system.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** A malicious user can download and extract all the information about the system, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use of `load_file` suggests the attacker could read arbitrary files from the server which can be used in advanced exploitation scenarios like remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a GET request, using the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **SQL Injection Payloads:** Specifically crafted SQL injection payloads are used to manipulate the SQL query executed by the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker must have sufficient knowledge to craft malicious SQL payloads that can be injected through the `id` parameter.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The provided information does not indicate any authentication being required to exploit this vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "CRITICAL," highlighting the severe potential impact.
*   The content provides several types of SQL injection payloads which include boolean based, error based, time based and UNION query based.
*   The provided PoC link can be used to reproduce this vulnerability.
