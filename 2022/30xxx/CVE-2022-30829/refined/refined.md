{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter of the `users_edit.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLi)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., database name, user information), modify data, or potentially gain full control of the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the `users_edit.php` file with a crafted SQL payload in the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL to craft the malicious payload."
