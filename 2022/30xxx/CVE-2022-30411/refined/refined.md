The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30411.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the `id` parameter of the `/ctpms/admin/?page=individuals/view_individual` endpoint, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of the `id` parameter in a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database names, user information, and other application data.
- Unauthorized Access: This could also allow for further malicious activities, if the attacker were able to modify or add data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exposed through a GET request to the `/ctpms/admin/?page=individuals/view_individual` endpoint.
- Malicious SQL payload: The attacker injects a crafted SQL payload via the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection: The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to construct a malicious payload.
