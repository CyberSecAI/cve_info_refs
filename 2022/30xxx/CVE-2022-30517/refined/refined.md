{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Mogu blog application does not perform sufficient validation on uploaded files, specifically user avatar images. It relies solely on client-side processing, leading to arbitrary file uploads.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper file type validation",
    "Lack of server-side file format checks"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including HTML files containing XSS payloads. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if the uploaded file is accessed.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a malicious file (e.g., an HTML file with a XSS payload) via the user avatar upload functionality. The file name is modified with a HTML suffix using an intercepting proxy. The attacker can then access the uploaded file through a browser, triggering the payload.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the application to access the user avatar upload function and able to intercept the request with a tool like Burp Suite."
