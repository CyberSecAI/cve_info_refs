{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize the 'path' parameter in the URL, allowing a user to input arbitrary file paths.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path Traversal vulnerability due to unsanitized user-supplied input used in file path construction.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system by manipulating the 'path' parameter, potentially accessing sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint with a malicious 'path' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application and manipulate the URL parameters. No authentication was mentioned as a requirement for successful exploitation."
