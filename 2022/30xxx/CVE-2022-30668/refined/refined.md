- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory leak. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from memory.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by a user opening a specially crafted file. The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction to open the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a crafted file that the victim opens with the vulnerable software. No special privileges are required.
