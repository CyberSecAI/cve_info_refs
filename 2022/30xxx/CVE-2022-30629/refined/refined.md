Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `crypto/tls` package in Go did not generate a random 32-bit value for `ticket_age_add` when creating TLS session tickets. It was always set to 0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Randomness:** The `ticket_age_add` value, intended to obscure the age of the session ticket, was not randomly generated, violating the TLS 1.3 specification (RFC 8446, section 4.6.1).
*   **Session Correlation:**  The static `ticket_age_add` allowed an attacker observing TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session resumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** An attacker can potentially track users across multiple TLS sessions by correlating the session tickets. This allows them to build a profile of a user's activity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Passive Observation:** The attack vector is passive observation of TLS handshakes. An attacker needs to be in a position to capture and analyze network traffic between a client and server using the vulnerable `crypto/tls` implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** The attacker must have the ability to eavesdrop on TLS connections.
*   **Traffic Analysis:** The attacker needs to be capable of analyzing the captured network traffic, specifically TLS handshake messages, to compare session ticket ages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Go versions before 1.17.11 and from 1.18.0-0 before 1.18.3
*   The fix involves generating a random 32-bit value for `ticket_age_add` for every new session ticket.
*   The `ticket_nonce` is always set to 0 because only one ticket is sent per connection, making a unique nonce unnecessary.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Github user @nervuri.
*   The issue was assigned the identifier GO-2022-0531 in the Go vulnerability database.
