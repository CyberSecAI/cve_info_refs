{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The code uses `Math.random()` to generate a random string and random arbitrary numbers. The documentation for `Math.random()` explicitly states that it does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers, and should not be used for security-related purposes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of insecure random number generator"
    ],
    "impact": "The use of `Math.random()` can lead to predictability of generated values, which may result in security vulnerabilities if used in contexts such as authentication, session management, or generation of security tokens or keys. An attacker can potentially predict the generated values and compromise the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with knowledge of the code can potentially predict the output of `Math.random()`, especially if the seed is predictable. This could be achieved through analyzing the system, the timing or the code itself.",
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have knowledge or access to the code, and a capacity to analyze the output of the random generation. "
