        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop in `crypto/rand.Read` on Windows when passed a buffer larger than 1 << 32 - 1 bytes. This occurs due to the way `RtlGenRandom` works and how the batching logic truncates the requested number of bytes.",
        "weaknesses": "The `rngReader` truncates the requested number of bytes to `uint32(len(b))` (or `len(b) % 1 << 32`). After the first call, which returns `len(b) % 1 << 32` bytes, the truncation will always result in 0, causing an infinite loop.",
        "impact": "An attacker can cause an indefinite hang/Denial of Service (DoS) by passing a large buffer to `crypto/rand.Read`. The application becomes unresponsive.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a network request if the application is remotely accessible, that makes calls to crypto/rand.Read, passing a buffer larger than 2^32 -1.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger a call to `crypto/rand.Read` with a large buffer. No specific privileges are needed.",
         "additional_details": "The issue stems from the discrepancy between the maximum size supported by `RtlGenRandom` (1 << 32 - 1 bytes) and the handling of large `Read` requests in the `crypto/rand` package. The fix involves chunking large `Read` calls to a maximum of 1 << 31 - 1 bytes."
