Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-30701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an insecure configuration of OpenSSL within Trend Micro Apex One. Specifically, the software loads an OpenSSL configuration file from a location that is not properly secured.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The primary vulnerability is that the OpenSSL configuration file is loaded from an unsecured location. This means an attacker can potentially place a malicious configuration file in that location, which would then be loaded by the vulnerable process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level. This means the attacker gains complete control over the affected system.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With SYSTEM privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must initially have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to be able to write a malicious configuration file to the unsecured location.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-30701 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One. It's caused by the software loading its OpenSSL configuration file from an unsecured location, allowing a local low-privileged attacker to achieve SYSTEM level privileges and arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious configuration file.
