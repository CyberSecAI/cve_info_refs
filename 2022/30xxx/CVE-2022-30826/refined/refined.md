Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `booking` parameter in the `client_assign.php` file is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Unsanitized user input: The application directly uses the value of the `booking` parameter in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Lack of input validation: The application does not validate the input to ensure it conforms to the expected format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information, such as database name, potentially other tables and data.
- **Data Manipulation:** It may be possible for an attacker to modify data within the database.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** If the database user has sufficient privileges, an attacker could gain access to operating system functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is exposed through the `booking` query string parameter of the `client_assign.php` script.
  `GET /Wedding-Management/admin/client_assign.php?booking=[INJECTION_PAYLOAD]&user_id=31`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL and the affected parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `booking=-31%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,database(),7,8--+` demonstrates the SQL injection. This payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to retrieve the database name.
- The SQL injection occurs in the `client_assign.php` file, within the `/Wedding-Management/admin/` directory.
- The vulnerable parameter is `booking`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered via a GET request.
- The injected SQL statement uses the `database()` function to reveal the name of the database which is `dbwedding`.
