The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Wedding Management System v1.0 by codeastro.com. This vulnerability is located in the user profile editing functionality.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an unrestricted file upload functionality within the `users_profile.php` file. The application does not properly validate or sanitize the uploaded file, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system allows uploading files without proper validation, which allows an attacker to upload any file type, including executable files like PHP scripts.
- Lack of file type validation: There are no checks in place to ensure that the uploaded file is an image or some other harmless file.
- No sanitization: The application does not sanitize the uploaded file name or content, which allows an attacker to insert malicious PHP code into an uploaded file.
- Direct access to upload directory: The webserver allows direct access to the upload directory, allowing the attacker to execute the uploaded PHP file via the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to:
- Full server compromise
- Data breaches
- Malicious activities on the server
- Defacement of website

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file through the profile picture upload feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid session in the administrative area.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the user profile editing function (e.g., logged in as admin).
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable path: `/Wedding-Management/admin/users_profile.php`
