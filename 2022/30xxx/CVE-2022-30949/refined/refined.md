Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30949:

**CVE-2022-30949**

*   **Root Cause:** The REPO plugin, along with Git and Mercurial plugins, allows specifying local file system paths as SCM URLs.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that these plugins, when used in Pipeline-related features, can check out SCM repositories from the Jenkins controller's file system using local paths as SCM URLs. This is problematic because, historically, only agents performed SCM checkouts, and there was no expected isolation between builds.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who can configure pipelines can use this to access SCM repositories stored on the Jenkins controller's file system, potentially revealing limited information about other projects' SCM contents.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker must have the ability to configure pipelines. They would use local file paths as SCM URLs within the pipeline configuration.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure pipelines to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Plugins:** REPO Plugin 1.14.0 and earlier. The Git and Mercurial plugins are also affected by the same issue and are listed with their respective CVEs.
