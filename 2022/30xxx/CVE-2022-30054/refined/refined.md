Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure handling of the `code` parameter in the `view_pass` page.
*   The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `code` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `code` parameter. This is evident in the provided exploit payloads that use techniques like boolean-based blind injection, error-based injection, time-based blind injection, and UNION query injection.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or validate the user-provided input before using it in the SQL query. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This could include user data, administrator credentials, and other confidential information.
*   **Account Takeover:** The attacker can take control of administrator accounts and all other accounts in the system.
*   **System Information Disclosure:** The attacker can download all information about the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** (Although not explicitly stated in detail but it is implied as the attacker is using load_file function) attackers could potentially use the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the database server, depending on the database configuration and capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the `code` parameter in a GET request when accessing the `view_pass` page.
*   An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `code` parameter via a web browser or a crafted HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker needs basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payloads.
*   No prior authentication or special access is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerability is located in the `page=view_pass` handler, specifically in how it uses the `code` parameter in the SQL query `SELECT * FROM application_list where code = '{$_GET['code']}'`
* The attacker uses the MySQL function `load_file` within the injected SQL to verify the SQL injection and make a request to a malicious external server, indicated by the interaction with the domain `okcga8d7p54vhfqrqqf74l3tvk1dp6dxgl78ywn.namaikatiputkata.com`. This confirms that the injected query is indeed executed by the server.
*   The provided exploit payloads demonstrate the use of several SQL injection techniques:
    *   Boolean-based blind injection to determine if conditions are true or false.
    *   Error-based injection to extract information via error messages.
    *   Time-based blind injection to measure query execution time.
    *   UNION query to retrieve data from other tables.
