{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to blind SQL injection due to unsanitized user input passed to the 'id' parameter within the 'view_details' page of the inventory section.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Blind SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, such as database credentials, and potentially gain administrative access to the system. This could lead to privilege escalation and complete control over the application's data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the 'view_details' page with a malicious SQL payload injected into the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable URL structure and the presence of the 'id' parameter. They must also have the ability to send HTTP requests. In this specific case, a staff user login is required to reach the vulnerable page."
