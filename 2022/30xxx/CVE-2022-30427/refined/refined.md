- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application constructs a file path by concatenating a base directory (`configs.RootPath`) with a user-supplied path (`c.Query("path")`) without proper sanitization, allowing directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability exists due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied path input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files and directories on the server by manipulating the "path" parameter in the URL.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP endpoint `/admin/setting/system/getdir` via the `path` query parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and manipulate the `path` parameter.
