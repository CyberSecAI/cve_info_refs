Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-30999

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the lack of sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the `fof/upload` extension. Specifically, the extension did not sanitize SVG files which could contain malicious JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized SVG uploads.
- Unrestricted file upload of SVG files

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Javascript code execution within a user's browser when the SVG file is accessed directly.
- Potential for data leakage by an authenticated Flarum user via malicious HTTP requests.
- Possibility of malicious data modification.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file to the server.
- A user is tricked into directly visiting the link to the uploaded SVG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files to the server via the `fof/upload` extension.
- The attacker does not need high privileges, a low privilege account is sufficient.
- Requires user interaction in form of tricking user into opening a link to uploaded malicious SVG file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `fof/upload` versions prior to 1.2.3.
- Version 1.2.3 introduces sanitization of uploaded SVG files, mitigating the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS score of 8.7
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting)
- The fix was introduced in pull request #318: "Clean and validate uploaded SVG files".
