| I love SVGs but they also bring wide range of vulnerabilities. When inserted as an image, the contained scripts will not be executed but once the image is uploaded on the server, user just needs to be convinced to visit the link for havoc to be wrought. |

| With great features come vulnerabilities, but that should be decided by the forum admin by allowing the svg mimetype or not. It would be nice though to be able to choose whether images are inserted as images or as links. |

| I agree that admins should have say in this but if `flagrow/upload` is striving to be a secure software, it should   1. inform the user about [possible consequences](https://www.bjornjohansen.no/svg-in-wordpress), and 2. try to mitigate the risk (at least by using [SVG sanitizer](https://github.com/darylldoyle/svg-sanitizer)).   Either way, security minefields should not be enabled by default. |

| [@jtojnar](https://github.com/jtojnar) thanks for that link I think it would make for a great optional add-on feature. A solution for now would be to add a settings input field that would allow configuration of mime types being shown as images. Wouldn't that solve this all together? |

| [@luceos](https://github.com/luceos) Showing the SVGs as images (via `img` tag) is actually safe. The issue occurs when the uploaded file is visited directly. |

# Possible cross-site scripting attack via unsanitized SVG files in fof/upload

High

[imorland](/imorland)
published
GHSA-fm53-mpmp-7qw2
May 25, 2022

## Package

composer

fof/upload
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.3

## Patched versions

1.2.3

## Description

### Impact

If FoF Upload is configured to allow the uploading of SVG files (`image/svg+xml`), navigating directly to an SVG file URI could execute arbitrary Javascript code decided by an attacker.

This Javascript code could include the execution of HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any other web service. This could allow data to be leaked by an authenticated Flarum user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously.

### Patches

This has been patched with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files.

### Workarounds

Upgrade to `1.2.3` (requires Flarum 1.2 or later), or remove the ability for users to upload SVG files through FoF Upload.

### References

Thank you to Safwat Refaat for the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N
