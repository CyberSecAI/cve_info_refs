Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-30852:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an oversight in access control implementation within the `Homepage` class under the `Idno\Pages\Admin` namespace in the Known CMS. Specifically, the `createGatekeeper()` function was used instead of the intended `adminGatekeeper()` function for securing access to certain settings pages in the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The core vulnerability is an IDOR, where a logged-in, non-admin user can directly access and modify administrative settings meant only for administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A regular, logged-in user can access the admin panel's homepage settings and toggle content visibility on the front end of the site. This allows a non-admin user to control which content is displayed on the site frontend.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface. Any logged-in user can access the vulnerable page and change settings if not protected by the `adminGatekeeper()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a registered and logged-in user of the Known CMS. They do not need any special privileges beyond a standard user account.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable functions are `getContent()` and `postContent()` within the `Homepage` class.
- The `adminGatekeeper()` function is designed to ensure that only logged-in site administrators can access admin pages. The `createGatekeeper()` function does not perform the required admin check.
- The fix is to replace `$this->createGatekeeper` with `$this->adminGatekeeper` in the vulnerable code.
- The author notes that the vulnerability is easy to exploit.
- A pull request addressing this issue was approved by the vendor.
