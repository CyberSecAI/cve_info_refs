- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the backend of jfinal\_cms version 5.1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, a vulnerable argument passing mechanism is present.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In some cases, it could allow for complete control of the underlying system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is reachable via a specific backend route within the application. The attack is performed by crafting a malicious SQL payload within the vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to access the backend part of the application and be able to manipulate the vulnerable parameter. The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable route and the injectable parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
