Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `update_status.php` file when handling the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application directly uses the user-supplied `id` parameter in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name. The provided example shows the attacker determining the length of the database name, which is a preliminary step to potentially extracting the entire name or other data.
- **Potential for full database compromise**: Although the provided example only extracts the database name, a skilled attacker can use this vector to read other data, modify or delete records, or even gain access to the underlying server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `update_status.php` script with a manipulated `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability as it is located in the `admin` section which, according to the report, has default login credentials.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection is required to craft malicious payloads.
