The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Insurance Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `recipt_no` parameter within the `/insurance/editPayment.php` file before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- The attacker can modify or delete data, or potentially gain further access to the system depending on the database permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests to `/insurance/editPayment.php` with a crafted `recipt_no` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No specific user account is needed to exploit the SQLi, but having a valid account helps in identifying the vulnerable page `/insurance/editPayment.php`.
