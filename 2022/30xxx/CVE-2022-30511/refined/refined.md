Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is an unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability present in the `$_GET['id']` parameter of the `/dms/admin/accounts/view_details.php` file in the School Dormitory Management System version 1.0. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the `id` GET parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The system is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the vulnerability is accessible without prior authentication.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials, student information, payment details, etc.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker can modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
- **Complete System Takeover:** In some cases, SQL injection vulnerabilities can lead to complete system takeover if the underlying database server is compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request where the `id` parameter is appended to the URL.
- **Manipulated Input:** The attacker manipulates the value of the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication, making it very easy to exploit.
- **Basic Web Exploitation Skills:** The attacker needs some basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details from Github Content:**
- The Github content provides specific SQL injection payloads that can be used to test for and exploit the vulnerability. These payloads demonstrate:
    - Boolean-based blind SQL injection
    - Error-based SQL injection
    - Time-based blind SQL injection
- It also shows how `sqlmap` can be used to exploit the vulnerability.

In summary, the School Dormitory Management System is vulnerable to an unauthenticated SQL injection through the `id` parameter. This allows an attacker to potentially compromise the system and access sensitive data.
