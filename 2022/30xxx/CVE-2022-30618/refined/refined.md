- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sensitive data, such as email and password reset tokens, for API users is disclosed in JSON responses within the Strapi admin panel. This occurs when content types accessible to an authenticated admin user contain relationships to API users (from:users-permissions).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive data exposure via JSON responses. This includes email addresses and password reset tokens of API users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A low-privileged authenticated user can gain access to sensitive information of API users. This allows them to potentially compromise these API users' accounts if the password reset API endpoints are enabled. A worst-case scenario involves a low-privileged user gaining access to a high-privileged API account, allowing them to read and modify data, and block access to both admin panel and API.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated user with access to the Strapi admin panel can view the sensitive data by navigating to content types that have a relationship with API users, triggering the vulnerable JSON response.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a valid account with access to the Strapi admin panel. The attacker must also have access to content types that contain relationships with API users.
