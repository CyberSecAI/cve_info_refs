  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'id' parameter of the '/sns/admin/?page=posts/view_post' URL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially leak database information by injecting SQL queries into the vulnerable parameter. As shown in the example, the attacker is able to determine the length of the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL, specifically manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to send HTTP requests to the application and knowledge of basic SQL syntax."
