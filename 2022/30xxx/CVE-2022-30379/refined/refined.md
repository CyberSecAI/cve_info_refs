- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/sns/admin/?page=user/manage_user` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify database content or even take over the database server, leading to data breaches, data loss, and potential compromise of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL ` /sns/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=`. By injecting malicious SQL queries into this parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the application and must be able to craft HTTP requests. No special privileges or authentication are mentioned in the report other than a backend login account.
