Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-30120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient sanitization of URLs generated for sorting within the Concrete CMS dashboard's "Stacks" page. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when using older browsers with built-in XSS protection disabled. These browsers do not automatically escape input, which allows the XSS to be triggered.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of a reflected XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's session when they access the vulnerable page on older browsers with disabled XSS protection.
*   **Limited Impact:** This is considered a lower impact vulnerability since modern browsers include automatic input escaping, preventing exploitation and the vulnerable page is an admin page. The impact is further limited by the fact that XSS is only achievable in older browsers with XSS protections disabled. This is a specific situation that would be rarely encountered.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The XSS could lead to the theft of session cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate a user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based since the vulnerability is in the URL, and therefore can be triggered through the network.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious link in the vulnerable section of Concrete CMS while using an affected browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Access:** The attacker does not need prior access to the system.
*   **Social Engineering:** To exploit the XSS, an attacker would need to induce a user to visit the crafted URL.
*   **Targeted User:** The target needs to use an older browser with XSS protection disabled.
*   **Vulnerable Software:** The target site must be running a vulnerable version of Concrete CMS (Versions 9.0.0 through 9.0.2 as well as 8.5.7 and below).

**Additional Details:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability was given a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.1. The vector is AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N, where "H" means high, "N" means none, "L" means low, "R" means required, "U" means unchanged.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability has been addressed by sanitizing the dashboard Stacks page sort URLs where built URLs are output, which prevents the execution of malicious JavaScript.
*   **Reporting:** The vulnerability was reported by Bogdan Tiron from FORTBRIDGE.
