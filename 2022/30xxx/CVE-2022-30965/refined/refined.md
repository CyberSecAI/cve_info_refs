Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-30965:

**CVE-2022-30965**
*   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability
*   **Affected Plugin:** Promoted Builds (Simple) Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 1.9 and earlier
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS)
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when a user views the parameter. This can lead to unauthorized actions, information disclosure or other malicious activities.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can configure a job with a crafted parameter name/description. When a user views the job's parameter page, the malicious script will be executed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs Item/Configure permission to modify job configurations and insert the malicious payload. The user must view the page where the parameter is displayed for the XSS to trigger.

**Additional notes:**
*   This vulnerability is part of a group of similar XSS vulnerabilities in multiple plugins that provide additional parameter types.
*   The vulnerability relies on how parameters are displayed on pages like "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters". Jenkins core has previously addressed this type of vulnerability on those pages.
*   A fix for this specific vulnerability in the Promoted Builds (Simple) Plugin is not available as of the publication of the advisory.
