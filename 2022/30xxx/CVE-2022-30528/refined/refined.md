The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the isic.lk tour booking website that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities including information disclosure, SQL Injection, and insecure file upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The application reveals sensitive information, including admin usernames, through the `/system/user/modules/mod_users/controller.php` endpoint with the `action=view` parameter.
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the login functionality, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication. Specifically, the `selectByUsername` function in `/system/user/modules/mod_users/helper.php` is vulnerable and the vulnerable parameter is `username`.
*   **Insecure File Upload:** The application allows for arbitrary file uploads through `/system/application/libs/js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/upload.php` after a preliminary request to `/system/application/libs/js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&editor=mce_0&field_id=selected_file`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.
*   An attacker can gain complete control over the server by uploading a web shell.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Information Leakage:** Send a POST request to `/system/user/modules/mod_users/controller.php` with the parameter `action=view`.
2.  **SQL Injection:** Send a POST request to `/system/user/modules/mod_users/controller.php` with `action=doLogin`, a crafted username, and password parameter to bypass authentication.
3.  **File Upload:** Send a GET request to `/system/application/libs/js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/dialog.php?type=0&editor=mce_0&field_id=selected_file` then a POST request to `/system/application/libs/js/tinymce/plugins/filemanager/upload.php` with a malicious PHP webshell file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST and GET requests to the target application.
*   No prior authentication is needed for the initial information leak.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads to bypass authentication.
* The attacker needs to know the specific file upload path.
