Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `page` parameter in the `edit_page.php` script is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The lack of input validation and sanitization of the `page` parameter in the `edit_page.php` script allows for arbitrary SQL queries.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to:
    *   Retrieve sensitive information from the database, including usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
    *   Modify or delete database records.
    *   Potentially gain further control over the server and the application by executing SQL queries that can interact with the operating system.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via an HTTP GET request to the `edit_page.php` script with a crafted `page` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the vulnerability is present in the `edit_page.php` script, which is accessible to anyone.

**Additional details:**
* The provided payload `?page=-1%20union%20select%201,database(),3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11--+` demonstrates how an attacker can inject SQL to extract the database name.
* The provided HTTP request highlights the method of exploitation.
* The vulnerable file is identified as `eliteCMS1.01/admin/edit_page.php`.
