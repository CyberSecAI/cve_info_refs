The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Wedding Management System v1.0 by codeastro.com.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user input in the `user_id` parameter of the `/Wedding-Management/admin/client_manage_account_details.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as database name, table names, column names, and potentially user credentials.
- Data manipulation: An attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request with a crafted payload in the `user_id` parameter.
- Example payload: `/Wedding-Management/admin/client_manage_account_details.php?booking_id=31&user_id=31%20and%20length(database())%20=9`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.
