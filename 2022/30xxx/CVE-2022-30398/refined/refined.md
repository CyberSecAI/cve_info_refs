The provided content is related to CVE-2022-30398.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `id` parameter within the `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=orders/view_order` endpoint of the Merchandise Online Store v1.0 application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries into the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data exfiltration: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database using SQL injection techniques. The provided example shows how an attacker can determine the database name by using `length(database())`.
- Potential for full database takeover: Depending on the database permissions and the specific queries used, a successful injection could lead to full database compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter.
    - Vulnerable URL: `/vloggers_merch/admin/?page=orders/view_order&id=`
    - Injection point: `id` parameter

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the vulnerable application: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application's endpoint.
- Basic knowledge of SQL: The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax and techniques to craft the injection payload.
