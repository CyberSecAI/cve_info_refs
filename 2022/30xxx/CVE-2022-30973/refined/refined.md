Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-30973:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-30973. It highlights the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and mitigation.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a flawed fix for CVE-2022-30126 in Apache Tika's `StandardsText` class. A regular expression used by `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by backtracking on a specially crafted file. The fix for CVE-2022-30126 was not correctly applied to the 1.x branch in the 1.28.2 release.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The core issue lies in a vulnerable regular expression used in the `StandardsText` class.
    *   The vulnerability is present in the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`, which is a non-standard handler.
    *   The incomplete fix from CVE-2022-30126 introduced another regex that was also vulnerable. This was addressed by CVE-2022-33879 in later versions.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a Denial of Service (DoS). This means the targeted service or application can become unresponsive or unavailable.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves feeding a specially crafted file to the vulnerable code, specifically using the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`. This crafted file triggers excessive backtracking in the regex, leading to a DoS.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to provide or have processed a specially crafted file by the vulnerable code that uses `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`.
    *   The attacker can be in a position to upload or have files parsed by the vulnerable application/service.

**3. Additional Details Beyond the CVE Description:**

*   The information from the `openwall.com` content shows that the initial fix for CVE-2022-30126 was incomplete, leading to another separate regular expression DoS vulnerability (CVE-2022-33879), demonstrating a more complicated scenario than originally perceived.
*   The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20220722-0004) clarifies that while their products utilize Apache Tika, none of their products were affected by this specific vulnerability. This provides information about the impact of the vulnerability on specific software implementations.
*   The vulnerability is explicitly limited to users running the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` which is not a default handler. This gives a better understanding of the scope of the vulnerability.

**4. Mitigation**

*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by avoiding the use of the `StandardsExtractingContentHandler`, or updating to Tika version 1.28.3, 2.4.0 or later.
*   NetApp notes that their products were not affected, meaning that their usage of Tika doesn't make them vulnerable.

**5. Summary of NetApp's Advisory**
* **Advisory ID:** NTAP-20220722-0004
* **Status:** Final.
* **Affected Products:** None.
* **Workarounds:** None at this time
* **Vulnerability Score:** 5.5 (Medium) CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

In summary, the content reveals that CVE-2022-30973, involves a regex DoS vulnerability in Apache Tika's `StandardsExtractingContentHandler` and that this was a regression due to an incomplete fix of a previous CVE. Exploitation requires a specially crafted file that would cause backtracking in regex parsing and denial of service. NetApp states that their products are not affected by the vulnerability.
