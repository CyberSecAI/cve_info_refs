Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30512:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the School Dormitory Management System version 1.0, specifically in the `payment_history.php` file, where the `$_GET['month']` parameter is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in `payment_history.php` on the `account_id` parameter.
- The application fails to sanitize user input provided through the `$_GET` parameter, specifically `account_id`. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system through database manipulation if other vulnerabilities exist

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/dms/admin/accounts/payment_history.php` file with a malicious `account_id` parameter.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges or authentication are needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `$_GET['month']` parameter within the file `/dms/admin/accounts/payment_history.php:31`, but the provided exploit payloads in the README target the `account_id` parameter and demonstrate successful SQL injection.
- The github content provides various SQL injection payloads for exploiting the vulnerability, including boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query injection techniques.

The github page provides proof-of-concept exploits for the SQL Injection vulnerability.
