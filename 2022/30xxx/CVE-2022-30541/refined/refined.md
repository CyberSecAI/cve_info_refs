- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the `webextport` value from an XML payload is directly injected into an OS command without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-crafted XML payload via an XMPP connection to the vulnerable device, targeting the `setUPnP` XCMD.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send XCMDs over UDP/55050 to the device. No authentication is required.
