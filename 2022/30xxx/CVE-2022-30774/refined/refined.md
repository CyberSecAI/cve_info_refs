Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-30774:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- DMA attacks on the parameter buffer used by the PnpSmm driver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition (CWE-367). The parameter buffer can be changed via DMA after the parameters are checked, but before they are used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for a DMA attack to change the content of parameter values. This leads to SMRAM corruption and can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within System Management Mode.

**Attack vectors:**
- DMA attacks targeting the parameter buffer used by the PnpSmm driver.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to perform DMA attacks, which typically requires a high privilege level (e.g., administrator/root).
- The attacker needs to be in a position to execute code with the ability to perform DMA.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Insyde engineering during a security review.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in the following Insyde Kernel versions:
    - Kernel 5.2: 05.27.29
    - Kernel 5.3: 05.36.25
    - Kernel 5.4: 05.44.25
    - Kernel 5.5: 05.52.25
- Siemens has released updates for their RUGGEDCOM APE1808 product family, which are affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in InsydeH2O UEFI firmware.
