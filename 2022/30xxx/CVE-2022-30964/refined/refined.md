The provided content is a Jenkins Security Advisory that lists multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-30964.

**CVE-2022-30964**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Multiselect parameter Plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view pages containing the vulnerable parameter. This can lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission, which allows them to modify job configurations and insert malicious code in parameter names and descriptions. The malicious script is executed when a user views a page where the parameter is listed.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *  The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permissions in Jenkins.
    *  The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload within the parameter name/description.
    *  The victim needs to visit a page that renders the vulnerable parameters.

The advisory also states that this vulnerability is part of a group of similar XSS issues in multiple parameter plugins (identified by SECURITY-2717) and that the vulnerability is resolved in version 1.4 of the Multiselect parameter Plugin.
