Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-30769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the generation of two session cookies upon successful login, where one of the cookies can be a poisoned cookie, leading to session fixation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The application doesn't properly invalidate or replace old session cookies upon successful login, allowing an attacker to pre-set a session cookie and then hijack the new legitimate session after a user logs in.
- **Multiple Valid Session Cookies:** The system creates two separate session cookies, both of which are considered valid, but not tied to each other in any way.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's session. Even after the legitimate user logs out, the attacker's session remains valid, allowing continued access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cookie Poisoning:** An attacker sets a specific "ZMSESSID" cookie on the victim's browser.
- **Successful Login:** The victim logs into the application.
- **Session Hijack:** The attacker leverages the still valid poisoned cookie to gain access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set a cookie in the victim's browser.
- The attacker can be remote.
- The attacker needs to be aware of the application's behavior regarding session cookies.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was found in ZoneMinder versions up to 1.36.12.
- The attack can occur even if the "Sessions" table in the database is empty.
- The article includes a step by step "Proof of Concept" guide on how to exploit the vulnerability.
- After the user logs in, the browser will automatically use the new session cookie, but the old poisoned cookie remains in the session table and is still valid, creating a parallel session that an attacker can use to control the application.
