Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-30510:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `$_GET['month']` parameter within the `/dms/admin/reports/daily_collection_report.php` file. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the input before using it in a SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication, making it easily accessible to attackers.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The provided payloads indicate that the injection can be exploited using blind techniques (boolean-based and time-based), meaning the attacker may not see direct output from the database.
- **Error-Based SQL Injection:** The attacker can induce database errors to gain information.
- **UNION query injection:** The attacker can use UNION queries to extract data from different tables.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, student details, payment information, and other confidential data.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker might be able to modify or delete data in the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, successful SQL injection could lead to the attacker gaining elevated privileges on the system.
- **Complete compromise:** A successful SQL injection may allow the attacker to potentially take full control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request:** The attack vector is the `month` parameter in a GET request to `/dms/admin/reports/daily_collection_report.php`.
  - Example URL: `http://localhost/dms/admin/?page=reports/daily_collection_report&month=[SQL Injection Payload]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques and database query structures.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning no credentials are required to initiate the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content includes several SQL injection payloads that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. These payloads showcase different injection techniques (boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based blind, and UNION query).
- The vulnerable software is "School Dormitory Management System 1.0".
- The exploit was tested on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) environment running Ubuntu.
- SQLmap can be used to automate the exploitation process.
