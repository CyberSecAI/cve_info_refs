The content is related to CVE-2022-30795.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application has an SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/onlineordering/admin/editproductimage.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information from the database, modify data, or potentially gain control of the server. The provided example demonstrates leaking the database name and its length.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a malicious GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter.
- Specifically, the attacker manipulates the `id` parameter with SQL injection payloads such as `19' and length(database()) = 12--+`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server. No specific user privilege or authenticated access is needed to exploit this vulnerability
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint (`/onlineordering/admin/editproductimage.php`)
