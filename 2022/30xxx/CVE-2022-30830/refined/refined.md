The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Wedding Management System v1.0 by codeastro.com.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of the `id` parameter in the `feature_edit.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   The attacker can retrieve sensitive information (e.g., database name, potentially other data).
*   The attacker could potentially modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL of the `/admin/feature_edit.php` script via an HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No authentication appears to be required to exploit the vulnerability.
