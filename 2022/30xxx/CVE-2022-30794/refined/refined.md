Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `editproductetails.php` file of the "Online Ordering System v1.0" application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection due to unsanitized input within the `editproductetails.php` file. The `id` parameter is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Information Disclosure: As shown in the provided payload, an attacker can use `UNION SELECT` to extract data from the database such as database name. This can be extended to retrieve more sensitive data, such as user credentials, product information, orders, etc.
- Potential for Data Modification or Deletion: With the ability to execute arbitrary SQL, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data from the database.
- Potential for further system compromise: depending on the database configuration and user permissions, an attacker could potentially escalate privileges or pivot to other parts of the system by running malicious stored procedures, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `editproductetails.php` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- Basic HTTP knowledge: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious HTTP GET request.
- Knowledge of SQL:  The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft the appropriate SQL injection payloads.
- Vulnerable Application URL: The attacker needs the correct URL of the vulnerable application and the vulnerable file (`editproductetails.php`).

**Additional Details:**
- The content mentions that the default login for the backend is admin/admin, which could also be used by an attacker if the SQL Injection leads to an ability to bypass authentication.
- The provided payload `ip/onlineordering/admin/editproductetails.php?id=12%27%20union%20select%201,2,database(),4,5--+` demonstrates a `UNION`-based SQL injection that is used to extract the database name.
