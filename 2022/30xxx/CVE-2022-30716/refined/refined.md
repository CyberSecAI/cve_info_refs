The provided document is a security bulletin from Samsung Mobile, detailing security updates and vulnerabilities addressed in their devices. It contains acknowledgements to security researchers, monthly security maintenance releases (SMR) with Google patches, and lists of Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE) items.

Specifically, CVE-2022-30716 is mentioned in the SMR-JUN-2022 section with the following details:

**SVE-2022-0254(CVE-2022-30716): Unprotected broadcast in DisplayToast**

*   **Severity:** Moderate
*   **Affected Versions:** Q(10), R(11), S(12)
*   **Reported on:** January 30, 2022
*   **Disclosure status:** Privately disclosed.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unprotected broadcast in `sendIntentForToastDumpLog` in `DisplayToast` prior to SMR Jun-2022 Release 1 allows untrusted applications to access toast message information from device.
*  **Root Cause:** Unprotected broadcast mechanism within the DisplayToast component. Specifically, the `sendIntentForToastDumpLog` function does not adequately protect the broadcasted intent, making it accessible to unauthorized applications
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper restrictions on a broadcast intent. This allows any application to register a receiver and gain access to the toast message information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can intercept and read sensitive information contained in toast messages from the device.
*  **Attack Vector:**  A local application on the device registers a receiver for the unprotected broadcast intent from `sendIntentForToastDumpLog`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the capability to install and run an application on the target device.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch adds proper restriction in receiver for the broadcast message, ensuring that only authorized applications can access the toast messages.
