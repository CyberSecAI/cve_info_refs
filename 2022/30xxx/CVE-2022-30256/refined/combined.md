Package        : maradns
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-30256 CVE-2023-31137
Debian Bug     : 1033252 1035936

Brief introduction

Two vulnerbilities were found in maradns, an open source domain name
system (DNS) implementation, that may lead to denial of service and
unintended domain name resolution.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.13-1.4+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your maradns packages.

Package        : maradns
Version        : 2.0.13-1.2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-30256 CVE-2023-31137
Debian Bug     : 1033252 1035936

MaraDNS is a small and lightweight cross-platform open-source DNS server.

CVE-2022-30256

    A revoked domain name (so called "Ghost" domain name) can still be
    resolvable for a long time by staying in the cache longer than
    max_ttl allows. "Ghost" domain names includes expired domains
    and taken-down malicious domains.

CVE-2023-31137

    The authoritative server in MaraDNS had an issue where it is
    possible to remotely terminate the MaraDNS process with a
    specialy crafted packet (so called "packet of death").

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.13-1.2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your maradns packages.

## What is MaraDNS?

MaraDNS is a free open-source computer program written by [Sam Trenholme](http://samiam.org).

MaraDNS implements the Domain Name System (DNS), an essential internet
service. MaraDNS is open source software: This means that anyone is
free to download, use, and modify the program free of charge, as
per [its license](license.html).

People like MaraDNS because it’s small, lightweight, easy to set up, and
remarkably secure. It’s also cross platform — the program runs both in
Windows and in UNIX clones.

More information describing MaraDNS is on the [overview
and summary page](summary.html).
## Current status

The most recent stable version of MaraDNS is [MaraDNS
3.5.0036](download.html), made on May 2, 2023.

Development of MaraDNS is now done in Git; the up to date Git tree
is available for checkout at
[Github](https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/),
[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/maradns/maradns),
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/maradns/maradns/),
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/samboy/MaraDNS),

and
[Sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~samiam/MaraDNS). Please
file all bug reports at
[Github, using
the discussions tab](https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/discussions).
## Support

[GitHub hosts the MaraDNS support forum. Click (or tap) here to
access MaraDNS support; be sure to have a GitHub account.](https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/discussions)
### Mailing list archives

There used to be a mailing list which provided MaraDNS support and
updates. This mailing list is no longer active, but archives are
available:

* [2007-2019 archives](2010s-mailing-list/)* [Third party archive
    (2002-2018)](http://marc.info/?l=maradns-list)* I have archives from 2001 in two files:
      [2001 archive #1](mailing.list.2001-1.txt) and
      [2001 archive #2](mailing.list.2001-2.txt)

## Sub-projects

MaraDNS has some other daughter projects which are part of the overall
MaraDNS toolchain.

* [lunacy](lunacy/) is MaraDNS’s scripting language for
  the scripts that make plain text and \*ROFF man pages of MaraDNS’s
  documentation, run tests, and power coLunacyDNS. It’s a fork of Lua 5.1.* [maramake](maramake/) is a implementation of make
    that ensures MaraDNS can compile with a (mostly) POSIX201X compliant
    implementation of Make.* [HalfSipTest](HalfSipTest/) is a fork of the code which
      generates official HalfSipHash test vectors used to make HalfSipHash1-3
      test vectors for MaraDNS.

## Other DNS servers

[Here is a list of some other DNS software
out there](dns_software.html).

For users of older versions of MaraDNS or Deadwood:
Please [update your package](http://maradns.samiam.org/download); there is
an [update guide](http://maradns.samiam.org/tutorial/update.html) available.

*For people who just want to quickly get current with MaraDNS’
security history should jump to the [history
section](#history). Note that MaraDNS’ last known security
problem was fixed on or before October 24, 2022.

I also have [a comparison of

MaraDNS should be a secure DNS server.

The reason why I say *should be* instead of "is" is because I
find claims of security very pretentious. There is no way that I can
guarantee that a piece of code as complex as a recursive DNS server
is completely free from security bugs.

What I can guarantee, however, is that such bugs are very unlikely in
MaraDNS, since the design has security checks and balances which
minimize the chance of there being a security hazard in the code.
## Why code is insecure

The main reason why code is insecure is because the code in question has
undefined results when fed data which is in a different form than what the
author of the code expected. The simplest case of this is the *buffer
overflow*, where a program is fed a string far longer than the program
was designed to handle.

Another example is the "cache poison" bug which ancient versions of
another DNS implementation had. With this bug, it was a trivial matter to
tell the DNS server that, for example, www.yahoo.com had an ip address of
say, 10.69.69.69, which really points to some sleazy
site that installs spyware. Why did this bug exist? Because the
original authors of this server did not expect remote servers to
deliberately give out incorrect IP addresses.
## How MaraDNS avoids these problems

First of all, MaraDNS uses a special string library which is resistant to
buffer overflows. It does this by having a maximum allowed size for a
string--any attempt to make a string larger than the maximum allowed size
causes the string library to return an error instead of overflowing a
buffer. In addition, the string library allocates an extra three bytes
for each string object, as a cushion against possible boundary conditions
(there was one case with another program which strived to be secure where
a one-byte buffer overflow resulted in a remote root exploit).

Second of all, MaraDNS protects herself from cache poisoning without ever
discarding glue records is by handling out-of-bailiwick records
differently, depending on where the offending records are. The actual
rules are fairly complex, and detailed in a document
called "[cache.poison.protection](http://maradns.samiam.org/cache_poison_protection.html)".

Third of all, I have extensively read Dan Bernstein's [notes](http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html) on DNS
implementation before implementing MaraDNS. Two ideas for
implementing DNS security discussed on Dan's pages have been implemented in
MaraDNS:

* When the recursive nameserver is performing queries, MaraDNS uses a
  securely generated pseudo-random-number-generator to generate the query ID,
  and the lower 12 bits of the query source port. This means that a given
  attempt to spoof a reply to MaraDNS has less than a 1 in 250 million
  chance of succeeding.* MaraDNS uses a FIFO queue to delete unused records when the cache
    starts to fill up. The algorithm is simple: Every time a record is
    accessed, it is placed at the top of the list. When memory fills up,
    MaraDNS deletes records at the bottom of the list. This allows MaraDNS
    to act in a very graceful manner when the cache starts to fill up.

Some known security problems are avoided: MaraDNS does not use printf() in
a manner which would make format string vulnerabilities possible; MaraDNS
does not use any of the potentially dangerous globing functions; and
MaraDNS signal handlers are very short, avoiding the problems caused by
poor signal handler construction.

I go though the code, and when I find anything which has the possibility
of allowing the data to be in an undefined state, I revise the code in
question. For example, when I was looking through the code in the 0.8.35
release of MaraDNS; I found a case where the data could potentially
become undefined. In more detail, if certain strings could not be
allocated or copied over--cases which can never happen--the code which
removes elements from the cache would attempt to free() unallocated memory
later on. Even though this was a case where it was impossible to exploit
the code in question, I felt it was prudent to update the code to not have
this problem--hence the vaguely worded "security update" for the 0.8.99
release of MaraDNS.

MaraDNS uses a minimum number of external libraries. This minimizes
the impact of insecure code not under MaraDNS' direct control causing
security problems with MaraDNS. This stops MaraDNS from having the
kind of remote full-control exploit BIND9 had when it linked to an
insecure version of the OpenSSL library.

MaraDNS also mandates that the server is run as an unprivileged user, and
strongly encourages MaraDNS to be run in a chroot() environment. In
addition, the DNS cache uses a separate data structure than the local DNS
records, making it difficult, if not impossible, for the cache at affect
the local records. This design means that, even if there is a security
hole in MaraDNS, the possibility of such a security hole allowing the
attacker having elevated privileges is next to zero.
## The security history of MaraDNS

MaraDNS has never had a security problem worse than remote denial
of service.

There have been 23 security problems found; none are worse than
denial of service (To be fair, three corrupt memory but in a way
where the corrupted memory is not controlled by an attacker).
One was a security problem
caused by broken behavior in Linux's kernel that affected stable
versions of MaraDNS. There are also theoretical (less than minor)
security problems caused by some research in to AES' implementation on
modern cached processors which have been addressed.

Here are all of the security problems ever discovered with MaraDNS:

1. The first major security problem was discovered by Roy Arends, one of the BIND
   developers, and was caused by the fact that very early versions of
   MaraDNS did not check to see whether a given DNS packet was a question
   or an answer. This was fixed well before the 1.0 release of MaraDNS.

   Since a DNS answer looks like a DNS question, with the exception of a
   one-bit difference, this bug allowed an attacker to send a spoofed DNS
   packet which would result in MaraDNS sending an answer to herself (or to
   another MaraDNS server), which would result in another answer being sent,
   and so on.

   The reason this security glitch passed through was because of an
   overzealous effort to honor the RFC spirit to be "liberal in what one
   accepts and conservative in what one sends". Since then, I have gone over
   the DNS spec to see if their are any other cases where a malformed packet
   could cause this kind of security problem, and have made an effort that
   any such cases in MaraDNS no longer exist.

   CVE number: CVE-2004-0789

   Impact: Remote denial of service.

   - Another major security problem was found by myself when performing an
     audit of the code during the beta test cycle. It involved the
     decompression code, and was caused because DNS compression is difficult to
     implement, and easy to create security holes with. I resolved this issue
     by completely rewriting the code in question with security in mind.
     This security problem was fixed in MaraDNS 0.9.01 (the rewrite came
     later).

     CVE number: CVE-2002-2097

     Impact: Remote denial of service.

     - Another major problem, which allowed a remote denial of service, was caused
       by some broken behavior in the Linux kernel. People using BSD or other
       kernels were not affected by this security problem. This security problem
       was fixed in MaraDNS 1.0.28 and in MaraDNS 1.1.35.

       CVE number: None

       Impact: Remote denial of service.

       - One old minor security problem involved the seed for the pseudo-random number
         generator. In cases where there was an ASCII null in the key for the
         pseudo-random number generator, MaraDNS would have less than a full 128
         bits of entropy for the seed. There was also a related issue, even more
         minor, where, in certain rare circumstances, multiple instances of MaraDNS
         could potentially generate the same pseudo-random numbers, if two copies of
         MaraDNS used the same static random seed file, and were started at the
         same time. These issues were fixed before the release of MaraDNS 0.8.24.

         CVE number: None

         Impact: Theoretical spoofing of DNS records.

         - Another minor problem, more recently discovered, was only present in the
           development (1.1) branch of MaraDNS. The fetchzone tool did not
           perform enough input validation and was vulnerable to specially formed
           packets that could send out-of-bailiwick data. I fixed this problem
           both ways; first by giving the fetchzone tool more input validation.
           Later on, I modified the csv2 parser to not accept the kind of data which
           would have triggered the fetchzone security bug. This issue was
           fixed in MaraDNS 1.1.38 (the csv2 improvements appeared in MaraDNS
           1.1.47).

           CVE number: None

           Impact: Spoofing of DNS records.

           - A theoretical security problem with the underlying random number generator
             that MaraDNS uses to generate secure random numbers was discovered by
             D. J. Bernstein. Since the underlying random number generator uses a fairly
             simple key schedule (well, a simple key schedule for a cryptographic routine),
             and since the random number generator uses table lookups, modern CPUs will
             very slightly vary (on the order of billionths of a second) in the amount
             of time used to generate a secure random number, depending on the underlying
             key. Bernstein needed to examine over 200 million packets, obtaining very
             precise timing information on each packet, to extract a key.

             I worked around this security problem by having the random number generator
             rekey every million packets. These changes were done in MaraDNS 1.0.27 and
             1.1.35.

             CVE number: None

             Impact: Theoretical remote spoofing of DNS records.- More recently, Dag Arne Osvik, Adi Shamir (the "S" in RSA), and Eran Tromer
               discovered some sophisticated cache data leakage attacks against AES,
               the algorithm from which MaraDNS' secure random number generator is
               derived. I have responded to this issue by tweaking MaraDNS' secure
               random number generator to essentially not leak sensitive key data
               via cache lookups. These changes were done for MaraDNS 1.0.35 and
               1.1.56.

               which describes the issue and how I work around it](http://maradns.samiam.org/download/patches/maradns-1.0.34-rng.patch)

               CVE number: None

               Impact: Theoretical local spoofing of DNS records.- There was a remote denial of service problem where someone could
                 disable MaraDNS' recursion by sending thousands of
                 specially crafted DNS packets per second to a server running MaraDNS. MaraDNS
                 would function normally again once the DNS packets were no longer being
                 sent. This affected all versions of MaraDNS, and was fixed in
                 MaraDNS 1.2.12.05, 1.0.40, and 1.3.04.

                 CVE number: None

                 Impact: Remote Denial of Service.- MaraDNS would leak approximately 20 bytes
                   whenever an invalid DNS packet was received. This leak would have
                   allowed an attacker to cause MaraDNS to allocate an arbitrary large
                   amount of memory by sending a very large number of invalid DNS
                   packers to the server running MaraDNS. This affected the 1.2 and
                   1.3 branches of MaraDNS, and was fixed in MaraDNS 1.2.12.05
                   and the 1.3.04 release of MaraDNS.

                   CVE number: CVE-2007-3114

                   Impact: Remote denial of service.- MaraDNS would leak about 300 bytes whenever a specially crafted DNS packet
                     (either one with a non-0 Opcode, or a non-1 Class) was sent to the server.
                     This leak would have
                     allowed an attacker to cause MaraDNS to allocate an arbitrary large
                     amount of memory by sending a very large number of invalid DNS
                     packers to the server running MaraDNS. This affected the 1.2 and
                     1.3 branches of MaraDNS, and was fixed in MaraDNS 1.2.12.06
                     and the 1.3.05 releases of MaraDNS.

                     CVE number: CVE-2007-3115 and CVE-2007-3116

                     Impact: Remote denial of service.- A CNAME record in MaraDNS' authoritative database could be corrupted by
                       someone sending a specially crafted DNS packet. This affected the 1.0, 1.2,
                       and 1.3 branches of MaraDNS, and was fixed in MaraDNS 1.0.41, 1.2.12.08, and
                       1.3.07.04.

                       CVE number: CVE-2008-0061

                       Impact: Remote denial of service.- A bug introduced in MaraDNS 1.3.03 (January 2007): Hostnames that
                         incorrectly not end with a dot result in a string being deallocated then used.

                         MaraDNS 1.2 does not have this issue.

                         This issue can **not** be exploited from zones loaded using DNS's zone
                         transfer mechanism; fetchzone filters data obtained this way. This issue
                         can **only** be exploited in the unusual case of an attacker having control
                         of the contents of a csv2 zone file to be parsed by MaraDNS.

                         This issue, on Linux systems, results in a null pointer dereference that
                         terminates that MaraDNS process.

                         This issue was fixed in MaraDNS 1.4.03 and 1.3.07.10, released February 2,
                         2010.

                         CVE number: CVE-2010-2444

                         Impact: Denial of service.- An array of integers was allocated in bytes instead of sizeof(int) units.
                           The resulted in a buffer being too small, allowing it to be overwritten.
                           Since the data placed in the overwritten array can not be remotely controlled
                           (it is a list of increasing integers), there is no way to increase privileges
                           exploiting this bug.

                           This bug was fixed in MaraDNS 1.3.07.11, MaraDNS 1.4.06, and MaraDNS 2.0.02,
                           released on or before February 5, 2011. This bug also impacts MaraDNS 1.0
                           and MaraDNS 1.2; since these versions of MaraDNS have passed their end of
                           life, they have not been updated.

                           Impact: Denial of service.
                         - MaraDNS 1's recursive resolver did not use a randomized hash, making it
                           vulnerable to certain denial of service attacks. This bug was fixed in
                           MaraDNS 1.3.07.14 and MaraDNS 1.4.10.

                           CVE numbers: CVE-2011-5055 and CVE-2012-0024

                           Impact: Denial of service.
                         - MaraDNS 2's authoritative server did not use a randomized hash, so
                           could be subject to certain denial of service attacks in the rare and unusual
                           case of an attacker being able to control its zone files. This bug
                           was fixed in MaraDNS 2.0.05, released February 12, 2012.

                           CVE number: CVE-2011-5056

                           Impact: Denial of service from a trusted user
                         - Deadwood releases before
                           Deadwood 3.2.02 allow entries to remain in the cache for a long time.
                           In light of the [Ghost domain
                           exploit](https://www.isc.org/files/imce/ghostdomain_camera.pdf) (PDF file),
                           this is a security problem.

                           Deadwood 3.2.02 is updated to only allow entries to remain in the cache
                           for one day. If max\_ttl is set, one can choose to store entries in
                           the cache for up to 90 days.

                           MaraDNS 1.4.11 and MaraDNS 2.0.06 include this updated version of
                           Deadwood. These releases were done on or before March 11, 2012.

                           CVE number: CVE-2012-1570

                           Impact: Canceled names can still be cached by Deadwood. For example,
                           if example.com points to a phishing page, and the domain is pulled by
                           ICANN, Deadwood might have kept example.com in its cache long after
                           the domain was removed upstream.
                         - MaraDNS 1 releases before
                           1.4.12 and 1.3.07.15 allow entries to remain in the cache for
                           a long time.
                           In light of the [Ghost domain
                           exploit](https://www.isc.org/files/imce/ghostdomain_camera.pdf) (PDF file),
                           this is a security problem.

                           This bug does not affect users of MaraDNS 2, but Deadwood has a
                           similar fix (see above).

                           This update was done on March 17, 2012.

                           CVE number: CVE-2012-1570

                           Impact: Canceled names can still be cached by MaraDNS 1. For example,
                           if example.com points to a phishing page, and the domain is pulled by
                           ICANN, MaraDNS 1 might have kept example.com in its cache long after
                           the domain was removed upstream.- While looking over the source code to Deadwood, I discovered that
                             Deadwood 3 releases before Deadwood-3.2.03d have a security
                             issue caused by a programming error I made.

                             Under certain exceptional circumstances, it may have been possible to
                             perform a blind spoofing attack against unpatched releases of Deadwood.
                             The IP performing the blind spoofing attack needs to appear to have
                             permission to perform full recursion with Deadwood in order to carry
                             out the attack.

                             Upgrading will fix the bug. Then again, administrators who already
                             perform good practices, making sure that only authorized IPs can use
                             Deadwood recursively (pretty much mandatory in light of DNS amplification
                             attacks) will only be affected by this bug if either a machine with an
                             authorized IP is compromised, or if it is possible for the attacker to
                             send the Deadwood server a packet with a spoofed IP.

                             This update was done before December 2, 2013. MaraDNS 2.0.07d,
                             Deadwood 3.2.03d, and MaraDNS 1.4.13 (as well as any future releases)
                             are patched against this bug. Deadwood 2.3.08 is not affected by this bug.

                             CVE number: None

                             Impact: Possible blind spoofing of records- There has been a long-standing bug in Deadwood (ever since 2007) where
                               bounds checking for strings was not correctly done under some
                               circumstances.

                               Because of this, it has been possible to send Deadwood a “packet of
                               death” which will crash Deadwood. Since the attack causes out-of-bounds
                               memory to be read, but *not* written to, the impact of the bug
                               is denial of service.
                               It appears this attack can only be exploited by an IP with permission
                               to perform recursive queries against Deadwood.

                               This bug is fixed in Deadwood 3.2.05 and Deadwood 2.3.09. MaraDNS
                               2.0.09 and 1.4.14 have been updated to include Deadwood 3.2.05. The
                               fix was made on February 12, 2014.

                               Note that this bug only affects users of the Deadwood recursive resolver.

                               CVE number: CVE-2014-2031 and CVE-2014-2032

                               Impact: Remote denial of service- Deadwood (MaraDNS 2.0) *might* be vulnerable to CERT VU#264212. That
                                 in mind, I have made
                                 MaraDNS releases (MaraDNS 2.0.11, Deadwood 3.2.07, and MaraDNS 1.4.16)
                                 with some code added to harden Deadwood and MaraDNS against CERT VU#264212.
                                 The fix was made before January 30, 2015.

                                 CVE number: CERT VU#264212

                                 Impact: Possible remote denial of service- In the zoneserver daemon, free() was being called
                                   against a memory location whose value was uninitialized (and therefore
                                   random).

                                   This bug allows a denial of service attack; by making the zoneserver
                                   daemon free an invalid memory location, it was possible to terminate
                                   the zoneserver process. I do not know whether or not this bug is
                                   remotely exploitable.

                                   I now always initialize the memory location in question.
                                   The MaraDNS 2.0.12 release, made on August 19, 2015, fixes this bug.

                                   CVE number: None

                                   Impact: Possible remote denial of service- There are two buffer overflows (actually, one buffer overflow and one
                                     buffer underflow) in ParseMaraRc.c.
                                     One of the buffer overruns

                                     in the mararc parser. The workaround is to not let random people
                                     edit the mararc file (which is usually in /etc and owned by root);
                                     the fix is in MaraDNS 2.0.13, release September 25, 2015.

                                     I checked, and, yes, MaraDNS 1.0.00 from 2002 had this particular bug.
                                     Most of the things like this come from the 2001-2002 codebase; I wrote
                                     too much code too quickly because there was a hurry to have an open-source
                                     DNS server that wasn’t BIND at the time.

                                     The exploit is very limited. It’s not possible to write to any memory
                                     with this bug; it only allows MaraDNS to read from a memory location
                                     she should not read from.

                                     CVE number: None

                                     Impact: It might be possible to make MaraDNS not start if one controls
                                     the mararc file MaraDNS reads at start-up time. Then again, anyone
                                     who controls that file could just more simply add a syntax error.- [There is a buffer
                                       overflow](https://web.archive.org/web/20201029102501/https%3A//github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/issues/21) (actually, underflow) which allows an out
                                       of bounds memory location to be overwritten with the output of malloc()
                                       in Deadwood.

                                       It is unknown whether this buffer underflow is remotely exploitable; it
                                       has only been seen on systems where there is no default gateway route.

                                       This issue was fixed in Deadwood 3.2.09 and MaraDNS 2.0.13 on September 25,
                                       2015.

                                       CVE number: None

                                       Impact: Possibly a remote denial of service.- There was a theoretical issue with the cryptographic code in Deadwood,
                                         where a standards-compliant compiler might not generate correct secure
                                         random numbers (used for the query ID and query source port). I can not
                                         find a compiler which actually generates insecure code (I tested against
                                         gcc 3.2.3, gcc 4.8.5, gcc 7.3.0, clang 3.4.2, and clang 5.0.1), but in
                                         the interest of caution, I am making a security update, and have added
                                         tests to make sure this bug does not manifest itself when run against
                                         multiple compilers and compile flags (it’s only an issue with -O2 and
                                         -O3 in clang using a different implementation of RadioGatún[32]).

                                         This issue was fixed in Deadwood 3.2.12, released on August 15, 2018.- The new Lua-based DNS servers, *coLunacyDNS* and *mmLunacyDNS*
                                           had issues where the string hash compression code was insecure, which
                                           could result in remote denial of service attacks under some
                                           conditions. This was an issue in the Lua code being used, which
                                           was fixed by patching *Lunacy*, the MaraDNS-specific fork of
                                           Lua.

                                           These issues did not affect MaraDNS nor Deadwood.

                                           This issue was fixed in MaraDNS 3.5.0012, released on August 12, 2020.- The LUA-based coLunacyDNS server before 1.0.010 had a bug where, if it
                                             was not bound to an IPv6 address, it would call FD\_ISSET on a
                                             connection not set up for the select() list. Since Ubuntu 20.04’s
                                             toolchain considers this a “buffer overflow”, I am marking this bug as
                                             a security issue of unknown impact.

                                             Neither the “MaraDNS” nor “Deadwood” services are impacted by
                                             this problem. The workaround is to bind coLunacyDNS to an IPv6 address;
                                             the fix is in [commit
                                             964d7892](https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/commit/964d7892edfecf1af4d33c51b2ddb50cb30dd8f9) which is part of coLunacyDNS 1.0.010 (MaraDNS 3.5.0018).

                                             This issue was found and fixed in December of 2020.

                                             - The version of coLunacyDNS included with MaraDNS between versions
                                               3.5.0008 (actually 3.5.0008 had mmLunacyDNS with the same issue and
                                               coLunacyDNS was added in 3.5.0009) and 3.5.0020 was not patched
                                               against [CVE-2014-5461](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2014-5461).

                                               Note that:
                                               * I am not able to actually exploit this issue with the version of Luancy
                                                 (Lua) coLunacyDNS uses* This issue only affects the relatively new coLunacyDNS server (and may
                                                   not affect it); it does *not* affect MaraDNS and it does
                                                   *not* affect Deadwood* This would only be an issue on systems where an attacker can somehow
                                                     affect the configuration file coLunacyDNS uses* The impact surface for this issue is, at worst, very very small

                                               This issue was fixed in coLunacyDNS 1.0.011 included with the
                                               MaraDNS 3.5.0021 release made on July 28, 2021.

                                               CVE number: CVE-2014-5461

                                               Impact: Possible local buffer overflow- Xiang Li from Network and Information Security Lab, Tsinghua University
                                                 discovered a way where “Ghost domains” could stay in the cache longer
                                                 than max\_ttl allows. I have integrated some measures to
                                                 minimize the impact of these issues so that caching can not be abused
                                                 to keep a rogue domain, already deleted upstream, cached for an
                                                 inordinate amount of time.

                                                 The attacks require an attacker who can perform queries against
                                                 a recursive instance of Deadwood. The only impact is that entries
                                                 may be cached longer than desired.

                                                 This issue was fixed in Deadwood 3.5.0022 released on May 7, 2022, and
                                                 in Deadwood 3.4.03 released on August 3, 2022. To allow
                                                 other DNS server developers ample time to fix and patch the issue,
                                                 I kept a 90-day embargo. I made the issue public on August 1, 2022,
                                                 after working with other DNS implementors and getting the green light from
                                                 them first.

                                                 CVE number: CVE-2022-30256

                                                 Impact: Records can be kept cached longer than desired- Xiang Li from Network and Information Security Lab, Tsinghua University
                                                   discovered a minor security bug where sometimes Deadwood would perform
                                                   more than 83 queries to solve a given request.

                                                   The attacks require an attacker who can perform queries against
                                                   a recursive instance of Deadwood and to control replies from a server
                                                   Deadwood queries. This only affects setups where root\_servers is set
                                                   in the Deadwood dwood3rc configuration file.

                                                   This issue was fixed in Deadwood 3.5.0024 released on October 24, 2022,
                                                   and in Deadwood 3.4.06, also released on October 24, 2022.

                                                   CVE number: None

                                                   Impact: Deadwood would make more than 83 queries to solve a single
                                                   request- MaraDNS releases before MaraDNS 3.5.0030 and 3.4.09 did not fully support
                                                     RFC8482. This allowed ANY queries to be used to facilitate distributed
                                                     denial of service attacks. While the impact is low with MaraDNS, since
                                                     it does not have large DNS packet support, MaraDNS has been updated to
                                                     fully support RFC8482.

                                                     This update was made on or before November 26, 2022.
                                                     The 2022-11-25 release of Deadwood.exe and the 2022-11-26 release
                                                     of maradns.exe are patched against this issue.

                                                     CVE number: None

                                                     Impact: It was easier to use MaraDNS to facilitate some kinds of
                                                     denial of service attacks.- The authoritative server in MaraDNS releases before MaraDNS 3.5.0026 and
                                                       MaraDNS 3.4.10 had an issue where it is possible to remotely terminate the
                                                       MaraDNS process with a “packet of death”. The Deadwood recursive
                                                       resolver was not affected by this bug, nor was coLunacyDNS.

                                                       This bug was fixed on May 2, 2023.

                                                       CVE number: [CVE-2023-31137](https://github.com/samboy/MaraDNS/security/advisories/GHSA-58m7-826v-9c3c)

                                                       Impact: Remote denial of service
