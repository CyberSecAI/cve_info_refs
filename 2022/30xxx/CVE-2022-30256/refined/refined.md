Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-30256:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way MaraDNS and Deadwood handle cached DNS entries. Specifically, revoked domain names (also known as "Ghost" domains, which include expired domains and taken-down malicious domains) can remain resolvable for an extended period because they stay in the cache longer than the configured `max_ttl` (maximum time-to-live) setting allows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Cache Management:** The core issue is an error in how the DNS cache is managed, leading to stale entries persisting beyond their intended validity.
*   **Violation of TTL:** The vulnerability violates the intended behavior of `max_ttl`, causing cached records to remain valid even after they should have expired.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Outdated DNS Resolution:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to users being directed to incorrect or malicious resources even after the domain names should have been revoked. For instance, if a domain was used for phishing, and then taken down, a vulnerable DNS server might still direct users to that phishing page due to cached entries.
*   **Unintended Domain Name Resolution:** As the description states, this leads to unintended domain name resolution, because the DNS server is serving old cached records instead of the up-to-date status.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **DNS Queries:** The vulnerability is triggered by standard DNS queries to a vulnerable MaraDNS/Deadwood server, where it caches responses.
*   **Time Based:** The vulnerability exists when a domain has been revoked and the DNS server still serves the old cached record.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Publicly Accessible DNS Server:**  The attacker does not need any special capabilities or position as the attack would be performed against a publicly accessible DNS server using common DNS queries.
*   **Queries Against Vulnerable Server:** The attacker needs to be able to send queries to a vulnerable MaraDNS or Deadwood server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as related to "Ghost domain names", which are domains that are no longer valid or have been taken down due to malicious activity.
*   The fix involves modifying the cache management to ensure that cached entries do not persist beyond the `max_ttl` limit.
*   This vulnerability is considered less severe in terms of immediate impact (compared to remote code execution), because it does not allow arbitrary code execution.
*   This vulnerability has been fixed in versions 2.0.13-1.2+deb10u1, 2.0.13-1.4+deb11u1, 3.5.0036-1.fc38 and 3.5.0036-1.fc37 of MaraDNS.
