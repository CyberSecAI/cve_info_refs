Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `unzipDirectory` function within the `aVideoEncoder.json.php` file. This function uses the `unzip` command-line utility to extract files from a provided ZIP archive. The core issue is that the `unzipDirectory` function **does not sanitize the paths within the ZIP archive**. This allows an attacker to create a specially crafted ZIP archive containing files with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), leading to file extraction outside of the intended destination directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization or validation on file paths within the ZIP archive. This permits the attacker to control the extraction path of files within the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious ZIP archive containing a PHP file with directory traversal, an attacker can extract this file to a web-accessible directory. Subsequently, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by accessing the malicious PHP file through a web request.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is executed through a crafted HTTP request sent to the `/objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` endpoint. This request includes a ZIP archive as the `video` parameter, along with `format` and `resolution` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User (with video upload permission):** The attacker must be an authenticated user with permissions to upload videos.
*   **Ability to Craft a Malicious ZIP Archive:** The attacker needs to be able to create a ZIP archive containing files with directory traversal sequences.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable AVideo instance.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `unzipDirectory` function within the `objects/aVideoEncoder.json.php` file.
*   The `chunkFile` POST parameter or a file upload can be used as the source of the zip file.
*   The `unzip` command is executed without proper validation of the archive content.
*   The `cleanDirectory` function is intended to remove unauthorized file extensions, however, by placing the php file outside of the intended directory the cleanDirectory function will not execute it.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Claudio Bozzato of Cisco Talos.
*   The vendor confirmed the issue and released a patch on July 7th, 2022.
*   The vulnerability affects WWBN AVideo version 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364.
