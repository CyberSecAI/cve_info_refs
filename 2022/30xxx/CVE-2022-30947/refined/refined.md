Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-30947:

**CVE-2022-30947**

*   **Root Cause:** The Git plugin, along with Mercurial and REPO plugins, allows the use of local file system paths (e.g., `file:` URLs) as SCM URLs.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The plugins do not properly restrict the use of local file paths when checking out SCM repositories, especially when executed on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with the ability to configure pipelines can potentially read SCM content of other projects by specifying local paths to SCM repositories on the Jenkins controller's file system. This allows for information disclosure, exposing potentially sensitive source code, configurations or other project data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The attacker needs to configure a pipeline to use a `file:` URL to access a repository on the Jenkins controller file system.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure pipelines in Jenkins. No specific authentication level is mentioned other than the ability to configure pipelines.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that historically, only agents checked out from SCM, and there was no isolation between builds on the same agent other than using different workspaces.
*   The issue arises when Pipeline-related features also perform SCM checkouts on the Jenkins controller, making it vulnerable to local file system access.
*   The fix involves updating the affected plugins to reject local file paths being used as SCM URLs on the controller.
*  The Git plugin versions affected are 4.11.1 and earlier.
* The CVSS score for this vulnerability is low.
