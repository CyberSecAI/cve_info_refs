Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-30948:

**CVE-2022-30948:**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Mercurial Plugin for Jenkins
*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Mercurial plugin, along with other SCM plugins, supports various URL schemes, including local file system paths (e.g., `file:` URLs). This functionality, combined with how Jenkins handles SCM checkouts, leads to the vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Local File System Access:** The plugin allows specifying local file paths as SCM URLs.
    *   **Lack of Isolation:**  Jenkins controller can perform SCM checkouts, and multiple projects might share the same agent and the controller can access the same files. This is unexpected behavior, as typically builds are isolated by using separate workspaces.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can configure pipelines to check out SCM repositories stored on the Jenkins controller's file system. This allows them to obtain limited information about other projects' SCM contents.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Pipeline Configuration:** Attackers need the ability to configure pipelines within Jenkins.
    *   **Local File Paths:** Attackers specify file system paths (e.g. using `file:` URLs) on the Jenkins controller as the SCM URL.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Pipeline Configuration Access:** Attackers must have the ability to configure Jenkins pipelines.
    *   **Jenkins Instance Access:** The attacker must have access to a Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Mercurial Plugin versions 2.16 and earlier.
*   The fix involves rejecting local file paths when checking out on the controller.
*   The provided text also mentions CVE-2022-30947 for the Git Plugin and CVE-2022-30949 for the REPO plugin which are affected by the same issue.
