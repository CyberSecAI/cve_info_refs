- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction. The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious file that, when opened by a vulnerable version of Adobe InDesign, will trigger the out-of-bounds write. The attacker has to entice the victim to open the malicious file.
