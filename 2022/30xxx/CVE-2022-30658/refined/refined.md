- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) because it involves opening a malicious file. No privileges are required (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious file that triggers the buffer overflow and requires user interaction to open it.
