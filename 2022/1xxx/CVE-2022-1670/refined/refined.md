- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the user invitation code functionality. It was possible to bypass the intended user limit when generating invitation codes, allowing the creation of more user accounts than initially specified.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation or logic flaw in the handling of user invitation limits.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could create an excessive number of user accounts beyond the intended limit.
- **Attack vectors:** By exploiting the invitation code generation process, an attacker can create additional accounts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to generate invitation codes, which typically requires some level of access to the Octopus Server.
