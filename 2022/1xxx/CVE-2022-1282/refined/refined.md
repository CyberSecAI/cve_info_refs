{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly sanitize the `$_GET['image_url']` variable, which is reflected back to the users when executing the `editimage_bwg` AJAX action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page which is reflected back to the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `image_url` parameter. The crafted URL needs to be executed in the context of the vulnerable application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into visiting it. No special privilege or position is required. User interaction is required (victim needs to click on the link)."
