{
  "CVE-2022-1015": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability gives an attacker a powerful primitive that can be used to both read from and write to relative stack data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution by an attacker.",
    "root_cause": "An out of bounds access in nf_tables expression evaluation due to validation of user register indices.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out of bounds access",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution",
     "attack_vector": "By forging an expression register value that will overflow upon multiplication with `NFT_REG32_SIZE` (4) and upon addition with `len`, will be a value smaller than `sizeof_field(struct nft_regs, data)` (0x50).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Unprivileged user and network namespaces access (CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNET) is required.",
     "additional_information": "The bug relies on a compiler optimization that introduces behavior that the maintainer did not account for, and most likely only occurs on kernels with `CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE=y`."
