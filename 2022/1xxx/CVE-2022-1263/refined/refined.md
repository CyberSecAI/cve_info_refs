{
  "CVE-2022-1263": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in kvm_dirty_ring_push within the Linux kernel's KVM module, potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition exists during vCPU release where kvm_dirty_ring_free() frees ring->dirty_gfns and sets it to NULL. If a KVM_RUN ioctl races such that vcpu->arch.st.preempted is 0, a subsequent call to kvm_dirty_ring_push() attempts to dereference the freed dirty_gfns pointer, causing a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Race Condition",
      "NULL Pointer Dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local unprivileged attacker can cause a kernel panic, leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "A local unprivileged attacker needs to issue specific ioctl calls, specifically triggering the KVM_CAP_DIRTY_LOG_RING ioctl and racing a KVM_RUN ioctl call during the release of a vCPU with dirty ring support enabled, leading to the NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local unprivileged access on the host system to interact with the KVM module, along with the ability to trigger the specific ioctls at the right time."
