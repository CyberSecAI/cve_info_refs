{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2022-1705",
    "description": "The `net/http` server improperly strips CRs surrounding the `Transfer-Encoding` header value, treating `\"Transfer-Encoding: \\rchunked\"` as indicating a chunked body.",
    "affectedComponents": [
      "net/http"
    ],
    "rootCause": "The `net/http` server incorrectly strips carriage returns (CR) from the `Transfer-Encoding` header, leading to misinterpretation of the header value.",
    "vulnerabilityDetails": [
      {
        "weakness": "Improper sanitization of the `Transfer-Encoding` header.",
         "impact": "This can lead to request smuggling if an intermediary server also improperly parses the header and does not reject the invalid request. Specifically, a request with a malformed `Transfer-Encoding` header can be interpreted differently by the server and the intermediary, leading to a desynchronization of the request stream. For example, the provided sample request with 'Transfer-Encoding: \\rchunked\\r\\n' will be incorrectly interpreted as using chunked encoding, and the following content as a chunked body.  This is a weak vector as CR characters are not permitted in HTTP headers except for line endings.",
        "attackVector": "Malicious HTTP request with crafted `Transfer-Encoding` header containing CR characters. For example, `Transfer-Encoding: \\rchunked`.",
        "requiredCapabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Go server that is vulnerable, with the crafted header. This might require an intermediate server that does not reject the invalid header, and which might have a different interpretation of the header."
