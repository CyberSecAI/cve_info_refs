- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WPQA plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input in the city, phone, and profile credentials fields when displaying them on the profile page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization/escaping of user-controlled data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the profile fields. When a user views the profile, the injected script will execute within the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user (Subscriber+) can exploit this vulnerability by editing their profile and injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with at least "Subscriber" privileges to access their profile settings and inject the malicious payload.
