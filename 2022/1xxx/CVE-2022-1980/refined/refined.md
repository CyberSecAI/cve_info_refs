Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause:** The "Product Show Room Site" application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Contact info-Telephone" field. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when a user views the page.
* **Weakness:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation/sanitization.
* **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This can lead to:
    * Cookie theft
    * Session hijacking
    * Redirecting the victim to malicious websites
    * Displaying arbitrary content on the page
    * Other client-side attacks
* **Attack vector:**  The attack involves injecting malicious code through the "Telephone" field in the admin panel which is then stored and displayed to regular users visiting the contact page.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    * The attacker needs to have administrative access to the "Product Show Room Site" application with the default credentials `admin:admin123`.
    * Once authenticated, the attacker can navigate to the system information contact info page.
    * They can then inject malicious code into the "Telephone" field, which is then stored in the system.
