- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate the URL of a file to be imported before making an HTTP request to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
- **Impact of exploitation**: High privilege users (like admin) can perform SSRF attacks by providing a malicious URL, which can expose internal services or perform other actions on the server's internal network.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker provides a malicious URL to the file import functionality, specifically in the "file upload by URL" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a high-privilege user such as an admin.
