| Hi,  In src/options.c, line 337.  // malloc() may fail, and str will be NULL. str=(char\*)malloc(strlen(pwd\_entry->pw\_dir)+14); // write to Null snprintf(str,strlen(pwd\_entry->pw\_dir)+14,"%s/.bwm-ng.conf",pwd\_entry->pw\_dir);  I think this is a vulnerability, and maybe we can patch it as following?  str=(char\*)malloc(strlen(pwd\_entry->pw\_dir)+14); if(!str) return  Thanks for any consideration!
