- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement. This occurs via an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data extraction (e.g., usernames and password hashes), modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX action that is available to unauthenticated users, making it remotely exploitable. The vulnerable parameter is part of a query in the `lang` parameter
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required. The attacker needs to obtain a nonce value from the page to perform the exploit.
