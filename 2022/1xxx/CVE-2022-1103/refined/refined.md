- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Advanced Uploader plugin does not properly restrict file uploads, allowing any authenticated user, including subscribers, to upload arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary files, such as PHP scripts, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the plugin's upload functionality located at `/wp-admin/upload.php?page=adv-file-upload`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber privileges.
