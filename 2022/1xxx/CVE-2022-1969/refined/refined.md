### Mobile browser color select <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing or incorrect nonce validation in the `admin_update_data()` function.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. Lack of nonce validation allows for forged requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthenticated attackers can inject malicious web scripts through forged requests. This results in stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a site administrator interacts with the affected page.
*   **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks an authenticated administrator into clicking a link or performing an action that triggers the crafted request.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious request and trick a site admin into performing an action that triggers the request.
