- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's subtitle field, stored as a custom post meta with the key "wps\_subtitle," is not sanitized when updated directly through the post meta update button (via AJAX). This bypasses the sanitation that occurs upon post save/update.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the affected post. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "wps\_subtitle" custom field using the post meta update button (via AJAX) and triggering it when viewing the post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a role of contributor or higher.
