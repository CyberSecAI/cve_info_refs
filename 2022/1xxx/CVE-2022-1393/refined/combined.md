## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Subtitle < 3.4.1 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin adds a subtitle field and provides a shortcode to display it via [wp\_subtitle]. The subtitle is stored as a custom post meta with the key: "wps\_subtitle", which is sanitized upon post save/update, however is not sanitized when updating it directly from the post meta update button (via AJAX) - and this makes the XSS exploitable by authenticated users with a role as low as contributor.

### Proof of Concept

- Create a post as contributor+ with the following shortcode in it [wp\_subtitle], save the post
- Add a custom field named "wps\_subtitle” with the following payload as value: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script> and save it \*\*without\*\* updating the post (from the custom fields meta box)
- View/preview the post/page to trigger the XSS
