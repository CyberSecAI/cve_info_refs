- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user (admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. This injected script will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected plugin's settings pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions, especially when the unfiltered\_html capability is disabled in a multisite setup.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker (admin user) must access the plugin settings page and insert the malicious payload into the "Funeral Home Name" field when creating or editing a location.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges in WordPress to access and modify plugin settings.
