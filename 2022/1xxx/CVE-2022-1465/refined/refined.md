- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in an attribute via an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically the `wishlist_quickview` action, with a malicious payload in the `key` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can exploit the vulnerability against any authenticated user by crafting a malicious form submission with the appropriate parameters to the vulnerable AJAX action.
