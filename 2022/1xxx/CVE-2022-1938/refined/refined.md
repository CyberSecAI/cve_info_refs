- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Awin Data Feed plugin does not sanitize and escape the `X-Forwarded-For` header when processing requests to generate analytics data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code through this header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the browser of a logged-in administrator when they view the plugin's settings page. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, performing actions on behalf of the admin, or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `X-Forwarded-For` header to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can trigger the vulnerability remotely. The attacker only needs to send a crafted HTTP request.
