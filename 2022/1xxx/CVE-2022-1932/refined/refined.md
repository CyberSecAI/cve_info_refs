- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them back in a page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to various malicious actions like stealing cookies, session hijacking, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited either through a Local File Inclusion (LFI) in an AJAX action or by directly calling the affected file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the injected JavaScript code. The attacker does not need any special privileges. They can then get a victim to click the crafted link.
