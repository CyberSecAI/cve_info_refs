- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input in certain fields, specifically the "Name" field when creating or editing a birthday.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable field. This code will be executed in the browsers of other users who view the content, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious script through the plugin's admin interface when creating or editing a birthday.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within the WordPress site. They need to be able to create or edit birthdays using the vulnerable plugin.
