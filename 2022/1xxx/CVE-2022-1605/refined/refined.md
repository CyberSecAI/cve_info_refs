The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1605.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Email Users plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF checks, allowing attackers to manipulate plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the notification settings of arbitrary users via a CSRF attack. This can potentially disrupt user communication or allow the attacker to control email notifications.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out through a CSRF attack, where the attacker crafts a malicious link or form that, when triggered by a logged-in administrator, updates the plugin's settings without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator into clicking the malicious link or submitting the form. The attacker does not need any specific access to the server or application, other than being able to send a crafted request.
