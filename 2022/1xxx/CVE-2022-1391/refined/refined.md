{
  "CVE-2022-1391": {
    "Description": "The plugin does not validate the controller parameter before using it in require statements, which could lead to Local File Inclusion issues. Despite what the original advisory claims, the issue is not exploitable by accessing the file directly as a fatal error is triggered before the vulnerable code is reached, however can be exploited by unauthenticated attackers via other requests",
    "Root cause": "The plugin does not sanitize or validate the 'controller' parameter before using it in `require` statements.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can include local files, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure or code execution, depending on the included file's content.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious HTTP request with a manipulated 'controller' parameter.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs no authentication and can make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
