  "CVE-2022-1231": {
    "description": "XSS via Embedded SVG in SVG Diagram Format in GitHub repository plantuml/plantuml prior to 1.2022.4. Stored XSS in the context of the diagram embedder. Depending on the actual context, this ranges from stealing secrets to account hijacking or even to code execution for example in desktop applications. Web based applications are the ones most affected. Since the SVG format allows clickable links in diagrams, it is commonly used in plugins for web based projects (like the Confluence plugin, etc. see https://plantuml.com/de/running).",
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of SVG content, allowing malicious SVG code to be embedded within PlantUML diagrams.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
	    "Improper Input Validation",
        "Stored XSS"
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation can lead to various impacts depending on the context, including stealing secrets, account hijacking, and potentially code execution, particularly in web-based applications embedding PlantUML diagrams.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network",
         "Embedded malicious SVG content within a PlantUML diagram"
        ],
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to embed a specially crafted SVG diagram into a system that renders it using the vulnerable version of PlantUML. No special privileges are required."

    "affected_products": [
      "plantuml versions prior to 1.2022.4"
