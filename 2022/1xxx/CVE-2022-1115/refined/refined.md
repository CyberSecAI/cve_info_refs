Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1115

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `PushShortPixel` function within the `quantum-private.h` file of ImageMagick. This occurs during the processing of specially crafted TIFF image files. The root cause lies in insufficient buffer allocation when handling image data, specifically during the import of pixel data using `ImportRGBAQuantum` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The core issue is that the `PushShortPixel` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer size on the heap.
- **Incorrect size calculation**: The allocation size of pixel buffer is calculated incorrectly, causing a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service. When an attacker provides a malicious TIFF image, ImageMagick attempts to process it, causing the heap-buffer-overflow and subsequent crash of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious TIFF File:** An attacker provides a specially crafted TIFF image file to ImageMagick as input. This can occur if ImageMagick is used to process user-uploaded image files.
- **Image Conversion:** The vulnerability is triggered during image conversion process (e.g., `convert poc /dev/null`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious TIFF file as input to a system running ImageMagick. This often requires interaction with an application or service using ImageMagick to process image files.
- **No privilege escalation:** No specific user privileges or special network position appears to be necessary to trigger this vulnerability; it relies on a vulnerability within the image processing logic.

**Technical Details:**
- The overflow occurs within the `PushShortPixel` function during the pixel processing.
- The `ReadTIFFImage` function, which is responsible for reading TIFF images, is also involved.  Specifically, the issue is within `ImportRGBAQuantum` that calls `PushShortPixel`.
- The provided crash log shows that the overflow occurs when reading a TIFF image file using the `convert` command.
- The patch involves an increase in memory allocation via multiplying by 4 when calculating `extent`.
- The vulnerability affects both ImageMagick6 and ImageMagick7.

**Patch Information:**
- The fix involves over-allocating the quantum pixel buffer in the `ReadTIFFImage` function, specifically by multiplying `extent` by 4 during memory allocation for TIFF images.
- This fix has been applied to both ImageMagick 6 and 7 versions.
- The commit messages indicate fixes for both ImageMagick6 and ImageMagick7 by modifying the `coders/tiff.c` file.
- The fixed versions are ImageMagick6 v6.9.12-44 and ImageMagick7 v7.1.0-29.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was initially reported via a GitHub issue.
- The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing using AddressSanitizer.
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that this issue is a security vulnerability and was closed as NOTABUG after the fix was released.
