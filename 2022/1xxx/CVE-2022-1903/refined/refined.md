- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing nonce and authorization checks in an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - Broken Access Control: Unauthenticated users can access and execute an AJAX action meant for password changes.
  - Lack of authorization: The AJAX action does not verify if the user performing the request is authorized to change the password for the specified user.
  - Missing nonce: The AJAX action lacks a nonce check which would prevent CSRF attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change the password of any user, including administrator accounts, leading to a full account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can trigger the exploit remotely. The attacker only needs to know the target's username.
