- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization and CSRF protection. This allows any authenticated user, even a subscriber, to modify plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the plugin's settings.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker can exploit this via a CSRF attack. An attacker could craft a malicious HTML form that, when opened by an authenticated user, will update the settings without the user's consent.
    - The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by simply being logged in as a subscriber and navigating to the vulnerable page
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be logged in to the WordPress site, even as a low-privileged user like a subscriber, or be able to induce an authenticated user to visit a malicious page (CSRF).
