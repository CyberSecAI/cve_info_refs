Should we use query parameters/substitution variables instead? Since otherwise we would need to anticipate all special characters, right? (disclaimer: Not my area of expertise)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Maybe something like changing:

```
cursor.execute(f"SELECT term FROM terms WHERE term > \"{floor}\" AND term < \"{ceiling}\" AND term LIKE \"{word}%%\" ORDER BY length(term),term LIMIT {requested_limit}")

```

to

```
cursor.execute("SELECT term FROM terms WHERE term > %(floor)s AND term < %(ceiling)s AND term LIKE %(word)s ORDER BY length(term),term LIMIT %(requested_limit)d", {'floor': floor, 'ceiling': ceiling, 'word': word, 'requested_limit': requested_limit)

```

that way types are respected. My VM is borked atm, otherwise I would test this out

I don't really know for sure, but don't think your proposal solves the problem. I think it would be just as vulnerable to the exploit. But I am not certain. Using prepared statements is likely the safest way to do this. But I think stripping out all " characters renders it safe, too. I should do some more testing.

Good discussion. Yes, prepared statements are *generally* described as protecting against SQL injection but of course, would need to be tested in the context of a specific library and query.
