  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The commit introduces a change to verify user login status before serving alignment files. It also includes a script to convert old OMIM case formats (list of integers) to a new format (list of dictionaries). Additionally, it adds a check for user logged-in status before serving alignment files and redirects to IGV alignments and sashimi plots only after user verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of file access: Alignment files were served without verifying if a user was logged in, potentially exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users.",
        "Inconsistent data format: The OMIM case format was inconsistent, with some cases storing disease information as a list of integers and others using a list of dictionaries. This inconsistency required a script to convert the old format to a new one."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized users could potentially gain access to sensitive alignment files without proper authentication. Inconsistent data formats can lead to errors and require data conversion.",
    "attack_vectors": "An unauthenticated user could attempt to access alignment files through the application. Inconsistent data formats can lead to data processing errors and incorrect representation of patient information.",
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are required, except the ability to send HTTP requests to access the alignment files. For the data format issue, no attacker is involved; it is an internal data management issue."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The commit addresses a vulnerability where alignment files were served without proper authentication. Additionally, it addresses a data format inconsistency with OMIM cases which required conversion to the new format. The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description placeholder. The commit also includes changes to redirect users to IGV alignments and sashimi plots only after verification, adding an extra layer of security. It is important to note that the root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of authentication on file serving, not the data format conversion issue."
