- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities on the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `vsrp_id` parameter of the `options-general.php` page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a victim to click a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
