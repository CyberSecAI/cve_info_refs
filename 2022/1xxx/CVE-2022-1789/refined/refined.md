{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from flaws in the Bluetooth BR/EDR specification, specifically in how devices authenticate after pairing. The lack of mutual authentication in Legacy Secure Connections and the ability to downgrade Secure Connections to Legacy methods allows an attacker to impersonate a previously paired device without knowing the link key.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of mutual authentication in Legacy Secure Connections.",
      "Downgrading from Secure Connections to Legacy Secure Connections.",
      "Unencrypted Bluetooth secure connection establishment.",
      "Lack of enforcement of secure connections pairing method for established pairings.",
	  "Devices paired using Secure Connections can use Legacy Secure Connections during secure connection establishment.",
      "Bluetooth devices can perform a role switch any time after baseband paging."
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can impersonate a Bluetooth device, completing authentication without possessing the link key. This can lead to an attacker gaining full access to the paired device, potentially combined with a KNOB attack to brute-force session keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed wirelessly over Bluetooth. The attacker needs to be within range of the victim device, know the device's address, and exploit the lack of mutual authentication or downgrade the connection to Legacy Secure Connections.",
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to spoof the Bluetooth address of a previously paired device.",
	  "Ability to downgrade secure connections to legacy secure connections (if required).",
	  "Proximity to the vulnerable Bluetooth device."
    ],
	"additional_details": "The attack can be executed in two ways depending on the secure pairing method used between devices. If Secure Connections was used, the attacker can claim to no longer support secure connections, forcing a downgrade to legacy authentication. Otherwise, the attacker can initiate a role switch to become the master and complete the authentication, even if the remote device does not mutually authenticate the attacker."
