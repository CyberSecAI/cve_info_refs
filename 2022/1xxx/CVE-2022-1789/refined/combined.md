## Bluetooth devices supporting BR/EDR are vulnerable to impersonation attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#647177

Original Release Date: 2020-05-18 | Last Revised: 2021-02-10

---

### Overview

Bluetooth Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) Core Configurations are used for low-power short-range communications. To establish an encrypted connection, two Bluetooth devices must pair with each other using a link key. It is possible for an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to impersonate a previously paired/bonded device and successfully authenticate without knowing the link key. This could allow an attacker to gain full access to the paired device by performing a Bluetooth Impersonation Attack (BIAS).

### Description

Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology based off of a [core specification](https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/downloaddoc.ashx?doc_id=457080) that defines six different core configurations, including the Bluetooth Basic Rate / Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) Core Configurations. Bluetooth BR/EDR is used for low-power short-range communications. To establish an encrypted connection, two Bluetooth devices must pair with each other using a link key. It is possible for an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to spoof the address of a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure with some paired/bonded devices without knowing the link key.

The Bluetooth Impersonation Attack (BIAS) can be performed in two different ways, depending on which Secure Simple Pairing method (either Legacy Secure Connections or Secure Connections) was previously used to establish a connection between two devices. If the pairing procedure was completed using the Secure Connections method, the attacker could claim to be the previously paired remote device that no longer supports secure connections, thereby downgrading the authentication security. This would allow the attacker to proceed with the BIAS method against the legacy authentication unless the device they are attacking is in Secure Connections only mode. If the attacker can either downgrade authentication or is attacking a device that does not support Secure Connections, they can perform the attack using a similar method by initiating a master-slave role switch to place itself into the master role and become the authentication initiator. If successful, they complete the authentication with the remote device. If the remote device does not then mutually authenticate with the attacker in the master role, it will result in the authentication-complete notification on both devices, even though the attacker does not possess the link key.

The BIAS method is able to be performed for the following reasons: Bluetooth secure connection establishment is not encrypted and the selection of secure connections pairing method is not enforced for an already established pairing, Legacy Secure Connections secure connection establishment does not require mutual authentication, a Bluetooth device can perform a role switch any time after baseband paging, and devices who paired using Secure Connections can use Legacy Secure Connections during secure connection establishment.

### Impact

An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could impersonate a Bluetooth BR/EDR master or slave to pair with a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure without knowing the link key. The BIAS attack could be combined with the [Key Negotiation of Bluetooth (KNOB) attack](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918987/) to "impersonate a Bluetooth device, complete authentication without possessing the link key, negotiate a session key with low entropy, establish a secure connection, and brute force the session key". An attacker could initiate a KNOB attack on encryption key strength without intervening in an ongoing pairing procedure through an injection attack. If the accompanying KNOB attack is successful, an attacker may gain full access as the remote paired device. If the KNOB attack is unsuccessful, the attacker will not be able to establish an encrypted link but may still appear authenticated to the host.

### Solution

Bluetooth host and controller suppliers should refer to the Bluetooth SIG's [statement](https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-security/bias-vulnerability/) for guidance on updating their products. Downstream vendors should refer to their suppliers for updates.

#### Vendor Statement

Intel's Bluetooth Controllers (part of Wi-Fi/Bluetooth products) are not affected.

#### CERT Addendum

While the researchers have listed Intel controllers as affected by this vulnerability in their original report, Intel has disagreed and claims to be unaffected. The researchers have observed a lack of mutual authentication when using legacy secure connection, but that mutual authentication could, in theory, be implemented either in the controller or the host. The Bluetooth SIG has concluded that this was always the responsibility of the host and the current spec errata that have been adopted is just clarifying this fact. The host operating systems are responsible for implementing the mitigation.

An attacker with physical access to the Bluetooth connection could perform a spoofing attack impersonating the address of a previously paired remote device. This attack may result in the attacking device completing the authentication procedure successfully despite not possessing the link key. This flaw, in turn, could permit an attacker to initiate the Bluetooth Key Negotiation (KNOB) attack more efficiently, potentially gaining full access as the remote paired device. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2021-10-28 10:59:54 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1832397#c0)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-05-06 16:31:59 UTC  ``` A vulnerability affecting Bluetooth BR/EDR pairing was found in the Bluetooth Core specification versions 1.0 through 5.2. The flaw could allow an attacking device to spoof the address of a previously paired remote device to successfully complete the authentication procedure with some paired/bonded devices while not possessing the link key. This can permit an attacker to initiate the Bluetooth Key Negotiation attack (KNOB) on encryption key strength without intervening in an ongoing pairing procedure through an injection attack.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1832397#c3)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-05-07 17:08:33 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: CERT   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1832397#c4)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-05-07 18:07:17 UTC  ``` As per the report, for this attack to be successful several conditions are to be met: - the attacker needs to be within wireless range of a vulnerable Bluetooth device - the attacker needs to know the address of the vulnerable device - Secure Connections is not supported by the vulnerable device - Secure Connections is supported, but the attacker is able to downgrade the connection (by clearing bits in its feature mask)  Even so, an attempt to establish encryption will still fail and the attacker must rely on the KNOB attack ([CVE-2019-9506](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9506)) to break the encryption.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1832397#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2020-05-13 15:03:17 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Enforce the Secure Connections Only mode for implementations that do not require support for pairing with legacy devices. Disabling Bluetooth may be a suitable alternative for some environments, please refer to the Red Hat knowledgebase solution [1] for how to disable Bluetooth in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

# BIAS: Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS

# About the BIAS attack

TL;DR: The Bluetooth standard provides authentication mechanisms based on a long term pairing key, which are designed to protect against impersonation attacks. The BIAS attacks from
[our new paper](publication/antonioli-20-bias/antonioli-20-bias.pdf) demonstrate that those mechanisms are broken, and that an attacker can exploit them to impersonate any Bluetooth master or slave device. Our attacks are standard-compliant, and can be combined with other attacks, including the
[KNOB attack](https://knobattack.com). In the paper, we also describe a low cost implementation of the attacks and our evaluation results on 30 unique Bluetooth devices using 28 unique Bluetooth chips.

# Details

Bluetooth Classic (also called Bluetooth BR/EDR) is a wireless communication protocol commonly used between low power devices to transfer data, e.g., between a wireless headset and a phone, or between two laptops. Bluetooth communications might contain private and/or sensitive data, and the Bluetooth standard provides security features to protect against someone who wants to eavesdrop and/or manipulate your information. We found and exploited a severe vulnerability in the Bluetooth BR/EDR specification that allows an attacker to break the security mechanisms of Bluetooth for any standard-compliant device. As a result, an attacker can impersonate a device towards the host after both have previously been successfully paired in absence of the attacker.

We call our attack Bluetooth Impersonation AttackS (BIAS). Because this attack affects basically all devices that “speak Bluetooth”, we performed a responsible disclosure with the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) - the standards organisation that oversees the development of Bluetooth standards - in December 2019 to ensure that workarounds could be put in place.

# Are My Devices Vulnerable?

The BIAS attack is possible due to flaws in the Bluetooth specification. As such, any standard-compliant Bluetooth device can be expected to be vulnerable. We conducted BIAS attacks on more than 28 unique Bluetooth chips (by attacking 30 different devices). At the time of writing, we were able to test chips from Cypress, Qualcomm, Apple, Intel, Samsung and CSR. All devices that we tested were vulnerable to the BIAS attack.

After we disclosed our attack to industry in December 2019, some vendors might have implemented workarounds for the vulnerability on their devices. So the short answer is: if your device was not updated after December 2019, it is likely vulnerable. Devices updated afterwards might be fixed.

                 CVE-2022-28893

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-0494

    The scsi_ioctl() was susceptible to an information leak only
    exploitable by users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_RAWIO
    capabilities.

CVE-2022-0854

    Ali Haider discovered a potential information leak in the DMA
    subsystem. On systems where the swiotlb feature is needed, this
    might allow a local user to read sensitive information.

    implementation was enhanced.

CVE-2022-1729

    Norbert Slusarek discovered a race condition in the perf subsystem
    which could result in local privilege escalation to root. The
    default settings in Debian prevent exploitation unless more
    permissive settings have been applied in the
    kernel.perf_event_paranoid sysctl.

CVE-2022-1786

    Kyle Zeng discovered a use-after-free in the io_uring subsystem
    which way result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-1789 / CVE-2022-1852

    Yongkang Jia, Gaoning Pan and Qiuhao Li discovered two NULL pointer
    dereferences in KVM's CPU instruction handling, resulting in denial
    of service.

CVE-2022-1966

    Aaron Adams discovered a use-after-free in Netfilter which may
    result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-1972

    Ziming Zhang discovered an out-of-bound write in Netfilter which may
    result in local privilege escalation to root.

CVE-2022-1974 / CVE-2022-1975

    Duoming Zhou discovered that the NFC netlink interface was
    suspectible to denial of service.

CVE-2022-21499

    It was discovered that the kernel debugger could be used to bypass
    UEFI Secure Boot restrictions.

CVE-2022-28893

    Felix Fu discovered a use-after-free in the implementation of the
    Remote Procedure Call (SunRPC) protocol, which could in denial of
    service or an information leak.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.120-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
