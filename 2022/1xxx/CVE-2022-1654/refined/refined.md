- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `uninstallTemplate` function in the Jupiter theme and JupiterX Core plugin, intended to reset a site after template uninstallation, inadvertently elevates the user calling the function to an administrator role. This occurs because vulnerable versions register AJAX actions without performing necessary capability or nonce checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Authenticated Privilege Escalation**: The lack of capability and nonce checks on the `uninstallTemplate` function allows any authenticated user to gain administrative privileges.
    - **Insufficient Access Control**: Lack of proper access controls on AJAX actions allows arbitrary plugin deactivation, theme settings modification, and plugin deletion.
    - **Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion**:  Allows inclusion and execution of files from any location on the site due to insufficient checks on the `slug` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Complete site takeover**: An attacker can gain administrator privileges, leading to full control over the website.
    - **Damage to functionality and reduced security**:  Arbitrary plugin deactivation and deletion can disrupt site operations. Modification of the theme API key could also have negative consequences.
    - **Information Disclosure**:  Local file inclusion could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information from the site.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted AJAX request with specific action parameters:
    - `abb_uninstall_template` (Jupiter Theme) or `jupiterx_core_cp_uninstall_template` (JupiterX Core Plugin) for privilege escalation.
    - Accessing functions registered in `lib/api/api/ajax.php` (JupiterX Theme/Core) for plugin deactivation and API key modification.
    - `jupiterx_cp_load_pane_action` (JupiterX Theme) or `mka_cp_load_pane_action` (Jupiter Theme) for local file inclusion.
    - `abb_remove_plugin` (Jupiter Theme) for plugin deletion.
    - `jupiterx_conditional_manager` (JupiterX Core plugin) for function calls to `includes/condition/class-condition-manager.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (including subscriber-level user).
