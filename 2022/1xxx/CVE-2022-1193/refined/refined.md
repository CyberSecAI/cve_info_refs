{
  "CVE-2022-1193": {
    "Description": "Commit related details like commit message, description, sha1, etc are leaked to demoted guest users who should not have access to the repository of a private project according to the permission model. This information is leaked through a fork of the project created by the user(reporter/developer) before being demoted to guest. Once being demoted to guest, the user is able to sneak all the latest commits to the parent branch.",
    "Root cause": "A user who has forked a private project can still access commit information (message, description, sha1) from the parent branch after being demoted to a guest role.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Leakage",
      "Authorization Bypass"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker (former reporter/developer now guest user) can access commit messages and descriptions of the parent project's default branch, potentially revealing confidential information like unreleased features or vulnerability information.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to have been a reporter/developer of a private project, have forked the project, and then have their permissions demoted to guest. After that, the attacker can access the vulnerable information through the forked repo when attempting to create a merge request.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have been a reporter/developer on the private project, be demoted to guest, and have forked the project before their demotion."
