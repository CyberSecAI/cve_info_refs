# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via

Subject: CVE-2022-1198 kernel: use-after-free in
 drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c

Hello there,

There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c
of linux that allow attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device
using 6pack driver from user space.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Details  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

When a 6pack device is detaching, the sixpack_close() will act to cleanup
necessary resources. Although del_timer_sync() in sixpack_close()
won't return if there is an active timer, one could use mod_timer() in
sp_xmit_on_air() to wake up timer again by calling userspace syscall such
as ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_connect() and ax25_ioctl().

This unexpected waked handler, sp_xmit_on_air(), realizes nothing about
the undergoing cleanup and may still call pty_write() to use driver layer
resources that have already been released.

The race condition is shown below:

      (USE)                      |      (FREE)
ax25_sendmsg()                   |
 ax25_queue_xmit()               |
  ...                            |
  sp_xmit()                      |
   sp_encaps()                   | sixpack_close()
    sp_xmit_on_air()             |  del_timer_sync(&sp->tx_t)
     mod_timer(&sp->tx_t,...)    |  ...
                                 |  unregister_netdev()
                                 |  ...
     (wait a while)              | tty_release()
                                 |  tty_release_struct()
                                 |   release_tty()
    sp_xmit_on_air()             |    tty_kref_put(tty_struct) //FREE
     pty_write(tty_struct) //USE |    ...

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Effects  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can successfully trigger the vulnerabilities to crash the linux kernel.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Reproduce  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We could use pseudoterminal-based device emulation to simulate
ax25 device from user space and create a socket for it. Then,
we create four threads: the first thread is used to initialize
and start ax25 device, the second thread is used to close the
pseudoterminal-based device, the third thread is used to execute
bind and sendmsg syscalls, the last thread is used to close the
socket. Let these four threads to interleave, we could reproduce
the bug.

drivers: hamradio: 6pack: fix UAF bug caused by mod\_timer()

```
When a 6pack device is detaching, the sixpack_close() will act to cleanup
necessary resources. Although del_timer_sync() in sixpack_close()
won't return if there is an active timer, one could use mod_timer() in
sp_xmit_on_air() to wake up timer again by calling userspace syscall such
as ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_connect() and ax25_ioctl().

This unexpected waked handler, sp_xmit_on_air(), realizes nothing about
the undergoing cleanup and may still call pty_write() to use driver layer
resources that have already been released.

One of the possible race conditions is shown below:

      (USE)                      |      (FREE)
ax25_sendmsg()                   |
 ax25_queue_xmit()               |
  ...                            |
  sp_xmit()                      |
   sp_encaps()                   | sixpack_close()
    sp_xmit_on_air()             |  del_timer_sync(&sp->tx_t)
     mod_timer(&sp->tx_t,...)    |  ...
                                 |  unregister_netdev()
                                 |  ...
     (wait a while)              | tty_release()
                                 |  tty_release_struct()
                                 |   release_tty()
    sp_xmit_on_air()             |    tty_kref_put(tty_struct) //FREE
     pty_write(tty_struct) //USE |    ...

The corresponding fail log is shown below:
===============================================================
BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __run_timers.part.0+0x170/0x470
Write of size 8 at addr ffff88800a652ab8 by task swapper/2/0
...
Call Trace:
  ...
  queue_work_on+0x3f/0x50
  pty_write+0xcd/0xe0pty_write+0xcd/0xe0
  sp_xmit_on_air+0xb2/0x1f0
  call_timer_fn+0x28/0x150

  run_timer_softirq+0x3b/0x80
  __do_softirq+0xf1/0x380
  ...

This patch reorders the del_timer_sync() after the unregister_netdev()
to avoid UAF bugs. Because the unregister_netdev() is well synchronized,
it flushs out any pending queues, waits the refcount of net_device
decreases to zero and removes net_device from kernel. There is not any
running routines after executing unregister_netdev(). Therefore, we could
not arouse timer from userspace again.

Subject: CVE-2022-1198 kernel: use-after-free in
 drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c

Hello there,

There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in drivers/net/hamradio/6pack.c
of linux that allow attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device
using 6pack driver from user space.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Details  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

When a 6pack device is detaching, the sixpack_close() will act to cleanup
necessary resources. Although del_timer_sync() in sixpack_close()
won't return if there is an active timer, one could use mod_timer() in
sp_xmit_on_air() to wake up timer again by calling userspace syscall such
as ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_connect() and ax25_ioctl().

This unexpected waked handler, sp_xmit_on_air(), realizes nothing about
the undergoing cleanup and may still call pty_write() to use driver layer
resources that have already been released.

The race condition is shown below:

      (USE)                      |      (FREE)
ax25_sendmsg()                   |
 ax25_queue_xmit()               |
  ...                            |
  sp_xmit()                      |
   sp_encaps()                   | sixpack_close()
    sp_xmit_on_air()             |  del_timer_sync(&sp->tx_t)
     mod_timer(&sp->tx_t,...)    |  ...
                                 |  unregister_netdev()
                                 |  ...
     (wait a while)              | tty_release()
                                 |  tty_release_struct()
                                 |   release_tty()
    sp_xmit_on_air()             |    tty_kref_put(tty_struct) //FREE
     pty_write(tty_struct) //USE |    ...

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Reproduce  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We could use pseudoterminal-based device emulation to simulate
ax25 device from user space and create a socket for it. Then,
we create four threads: the first thread is used to initialize
and start ax25 device, the second thread is used to close the
pseudoterminal-based device, the third thread is used to execute
bind and sendmsg syscalls, the last thread is used to close the
socket. Let these four threads to interleave, we could reproduce
the bug.
