- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (such as an admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings. This code can then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected settings, leading to various malicious activities like data theft, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, specifically within fields like the "AWS Public Key."
