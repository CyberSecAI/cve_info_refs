- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `data[title]` parameter of the `aux_the_recent_products` AJAX action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send the malicious URL to the victim. No authentication is required. The user must visit the crafted malicious URL.
