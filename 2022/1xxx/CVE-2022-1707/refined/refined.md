**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input from the site search parameter (`s`). This unsanitized input is then used to populate the data layer, making it vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a webpage that will execute in a victim’s browser when the page is loaded (if the user clicks on a specially crafted link that is sent to them by an attacker).
    *   This could allow an attacker to perform malicious actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites or defacing a legitimate website.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request parameter `s` .
    *   An attacker crafts a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the `s` parameter.
    *   When a victim user clicks on the link, the server returns a page with the attacker’s script, which gets executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to get a victim user to click on a maliciously crafted link.
    *   The attacker can be unauthenticated.

**Additional details**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `~/public/frontend.php`
*   The vulnerability stems from how the plugin populates the data layer with the site search query.
*   The fix was released in version 1.15.1 of the plugin.
*   The Wordfence report mentions that this vulnerability affects versions up to and including 1.15.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Cory Buecker and not\_stoppable, as per the Wordfence report
*   The plugin developer, duracelltomi, quickly applied a fix upon receiving a report as stated in the github issue.
*   The github issue also mentions alternate method of reporting through a Twitter DM or messaging the Facebook page.

**Summary:**

The CVE-2022-1707 describes a reflected XSS vulnerability in the Google Tag Manager for WordPress plugin. It is caused by a lack of sanitization of the `s` parameter during site search and allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a victim's browser by sending a specially crafted link. The vulnerability has been fixed in plugin version 1.15.1.
