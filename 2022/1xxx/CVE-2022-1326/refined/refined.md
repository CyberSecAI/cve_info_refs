The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1326.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied input in Custom text fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into web pages by adding them to custom text fields within the plugin's forms. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Stealing session cookies.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
    *   The attacker creates or edits a form using the vulnerable plugin.
    *   The attacker inserts a malicious XSS payload (e.g. `<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`) into a Custom Text field.
    *   The attacker saves the form, and when the form is embedded on a page or post, the XSS payload is executed in the user's browser when the page is accessed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to create or edit forms. The user also must interact with the webpage where the form containing the payload is embedded.
