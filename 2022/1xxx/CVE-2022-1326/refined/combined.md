## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Form - Contact Form <= 1.2.4 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

Create/edit a form, add a Custom Text field, put the following payload in it: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>, save the field and update the form
The XSS will be triggered in page/post where the form is embed
