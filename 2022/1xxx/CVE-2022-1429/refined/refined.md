{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper quoting of column names in the `GridHelperService` when generating SQL filter conditions. Specifically, when a filter is applied to a field other than 'id', the code attempts to quote the column name by prepending 'o_' and then enclosing it in backticks (e.g., ``o_fieldname``). However, it also applies the quoteIdentifier function, which adds another layer of quoting using backticks. This results in double-quoting of column names and can potentially lead to SQL injection if the column name itself contains malicious SQL.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper SQL quoting",
      "Potential SQL injection"
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact is the potential for SQL injection. If an attacker can manipulate the filter field or value to inject malicious SQL code due to the double-quoting, they could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, modify data, or cause other damage.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the filter parameters used in the `GridHelperService`, particularly when filtering on fields other than 'id'. This could occur through direct manipulation of API calls or user interface elements that construct the filter parameters.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to interact with the application and manipulate the filter parameters passed to the `GridHelperService`. This could be an authenticated user with certain privileges or, in some scenarios, an unauthenticated user if the filtering is exposed without proper access control."
