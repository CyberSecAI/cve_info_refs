- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Zephyr Bluetooth mesh core stack occurs when a Transaction Continue PDU is received before a Transaction Start PDU. This causes the `SegN` variable to be initialized to 0xff, which bypasses a subsequent check, leading to a buffer overflow during a `memcpy` operation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
    - Improper handling of sequence of PDUs in Bluetooth mesh provisioning
    - Incorrect initialization of `SegN` variable
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Out-of-bounds write leads to memory corruption.
    - Potential impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, as a result of memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range (Adjacent Network) to send malicious packets.
    - Attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a Transaction Continue PDU before the Transaction Start PDU.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Attacker must be within the Bluetooth range of the target device.
    - Attacker must be able to craft and send Bluetooth mesh packets to the vulnerable device during provisioning.
    - Low privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
