The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1518.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability within the Illumina Local Run Manager (LRM) software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is classified as "Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')". This means that the software does not properly validate or sanitize the path provided by the user, allowing attackers to upload files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the path traversal vulnerability allows a malicious actor to upload files outside of the intended directory structure. Combined with other vulnerabilities (such as unrestricted file upload), this can allow the attacker to take control of the affected product remotely, change settings, configurations, software or access sensitive data, and also interact with the connected network.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. The attacker can upload malicious files via the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any authentication and needs a network connection to the vulnerable system. The attacker must be able to upload files using the vulnerable software.
