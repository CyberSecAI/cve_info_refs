- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape a setting ("Zillow Business URL"), allowing the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be a user with high privileges (e.g., administrator). They inject the malicious code through the plugin's settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be logged in with administrative privileges.
