- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path Traversal and Local File Inclusion vulnerability due to insufficient access control in handling AJAX requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Path Traversal: The `slug` parameter in the AJAX request is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the server.
    - Local File Inclusion: The vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary PHP files from the server through the `load_control_panel_pane` function in JupiterX theme and the `mka_cp_load_pane_action` function in Jupiter theme.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Information Disclosure: Attackers can gain access to sensitive information by including arbitrary files.
    - Privilege escalation: By including malicious code, an attacker can potentially gain administrative privileges or perform other restricted actions by including and executing files.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network: Attacker sends an HTTP AJAX request to a vulnerable endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have an account on the WordPress site (authenticated), even a subscriber-level account is sufficient to perform the attack.
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
