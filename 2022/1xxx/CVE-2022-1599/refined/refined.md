- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) checks in some of its AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection on AJAX endpoints.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in user with the necessary privileges into unknowingly executing actions that modify post status (draft, published), slug, post date, and comment status (enabled, disabled).
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs through crafted HTTP requests (forms) sent to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints, which can be triggered by a logged-in user visiting a malicious webpage controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user, with the required capabilities, to access a page controlled by the attacker. The user needs to be logged into the WordPress site for the attack to be successful.
