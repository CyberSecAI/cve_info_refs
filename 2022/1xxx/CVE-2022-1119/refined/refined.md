Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1119

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization and path validation within the `ee-downloader.php` file of the Simple File List plugin. Specifically, the `eeFile` parameter, which is meant to specify the file to download, is not sufficiently sanitized, allowing for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is path traversal, also known as directory traversal. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `eeFile` parameter to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Missing Access Controls:** There are no authentication checks or access controls in place to restrict who can access the `ee-downloader.php` script and utilize the `eeFile` parameter, enabling unauthenticated arbitrary file downloads.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** While the code uses `filter_var` with `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING` and `FILTER_FLAG_ENCODE_LOW`, it does not prevent path traversal using sequences like `../` in the input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download any file that the web server user has read permissions to. This could include sensitive configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending an HTTP GET request to the `ee-downloader.php` script, with a malicious value in the `eeFile` parameter that includes path traversal sequences.
    Example: `.../wp-content/plugins/simple-file-list/includes/ee-downloader.php?eeFile=../../../wp-config.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the WordPress website.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress website.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to have knowledge (or be able to guess) the file paths on the server to download sensitive files.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `simple-file-list/trunk/includes/ee-downloader.php`.
*   The vulnerability affects Simple File List plugin versions up to and including 3.2.7.
*   The issue is fixed in version 3.2.8 and later versions.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on May 23, 2019.
*   The vulnerable line is line 6 where the `eeFile` is filtered.
*   The `is_readable()` check (line 8) only confirms if the file exists and is readable, it doesn't prevent reading arbitrary files using path traversal.
