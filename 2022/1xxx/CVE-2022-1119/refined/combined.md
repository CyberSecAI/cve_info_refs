### Description

The Simple File List WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download via the eeFile parameter found in the ~/includes/ee-downloader.php file due to missing controls which makes it possible unauthenticated attackers to supply a path to a file that will subsequently be downloaded, in versions up to and including 3.2.7.
