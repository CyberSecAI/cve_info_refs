The provided content relates to CVE-2022-1717.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape some of its settings, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of sanitization and escaping of plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A high privilege user (such as an admin) can inject malicious scripts that execute when other users or admins view the plugin settings page or the frontend where the sidebar is displayed.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker with admin or similar high privileges injects a malicious payload into the plugin's settings (specifically in the "Share on xxxx" settings of the Floating Sidebar).
    - The injected payload is stored and executed when the plugin settings page or frontend is viewed when the sidebar is enabled, leading to XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have admin-level or similar high-level privileges in WordPress.
    - The attacker needs to access the plugin's settings page to inject the malicious payload.
