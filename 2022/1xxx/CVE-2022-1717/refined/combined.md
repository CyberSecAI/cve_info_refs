## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Custom Share Buttons with Floating Sidebar < 4.2 - Admin+ Stored XSS

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any of the Floating Sidebar > Share on xxxx (such as Share on Facebook) settings: " autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/)// and save
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the plugin's settings again, as well as in the frontend when the Sidebar and the related Social Share button (tick the checkboxes in the General settings) are active
All settings appear to also lack sanitisation and escaping
