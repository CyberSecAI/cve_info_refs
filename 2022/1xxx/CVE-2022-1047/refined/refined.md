- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape the current page URL before using it in an HTML attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with an injected script in a query parameter (e.g., `?%22%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the crafted URL. No authentication is required. The attack occurs on the client side once the user's browser renders the malicious URL.
