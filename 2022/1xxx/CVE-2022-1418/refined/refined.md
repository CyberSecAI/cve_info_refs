- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Social Stickers plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating Social Network settings and fails to properly escape certain fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    - Absence of CSRF protection.
    - Insufficient input sanitization/escaping.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which are then executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing administrative actions on the WordPress site.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, updates the vulnerable settings with malicious javascript payloads.
    - The vulnerable parameter is the "behance" field within the Social Network settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the malicious form, which can be done via social engineering or by embedding it into a page the admin is likely to visit.
