{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from incorrect access control checks in the patient disclosure functionality. Specifically, the code was not properly verifying if a user had the required 'write' or 'addonly' permissions before allowing them to perform certain actions, such as adding or editing disclosures.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper authorization checks",
       "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with insufficient privileges can create, edit, or delete patient disclosure records. This could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive patient information or modification of records without proper authorization.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through the web interface by sending crafted requests to the `disclosure_full.php` and `record_disclosure.php` pages, allowing a malicious user to bypass the intended authorization checks.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the OpenEMR application and be a user with some level of access to patient records. They also need to have knowledge of the application structure and the vulnerable endpoints in order to craft specific requests."
