- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by importing a specially crafted CSV file containing malicious JavaScript code through the plugin's import functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to upload a crafted CSV file via the plugin's import functionality. The attacker needs to trick a victim into visiting a crafted link to trigger the vulnerability.
