  "CVE-2022-1996": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate go-restful. emicklei/go-restful versions prior to v3.8.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `isOriginAllowed` function within `cors_filter.go`. It appears that the function performed a case-insensitive comparison between the request origin and the allowed domains, as well as an exact string comparison, while also trying to match using regular expressions.  The regular expression matching was being done by the MatchString method of the regexp package, and that was correctly case-sensitive. However, the exact match on AllowedDomains was being done using an exact string match without lower casing the origin and the allowed domain, which would make a case-insensitive comparison fail.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "CORS Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can send a crafted HTTP request with an `Origin` header that passes the case-insensitive check in `isOriginAllowed` but would fail on case-sensitive check allowing access to resources which should be protected by CORS.",
        "Specifically, an attacker could bypass CORS checks by sending an origin that differs in casing but is otherwise identical to an allowed domain."

    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to send a crafted HTTP request.  No specific position or elevated privileges are needed, other than being able to send requests to the server using the vulnerable `go-restful` package."
