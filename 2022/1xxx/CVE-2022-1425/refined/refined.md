The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1425.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of validation of the `message_id` parameter in the `wpqa_message_view` AJAX action. The plugin does not verify if the message belongs to the requesting user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Any authenticated user (Subscriber+) can read private messages of other users by exploiting the IDOR vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `wpqa_message_view` and a `message_id` parameter which can be any numeric ID.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least Subscriber privileges.
- The attacker needs to know or be able to guess message IDs, which is a numeric value and can be bruteforced.
