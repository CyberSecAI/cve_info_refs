- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-provided input in the "Quote" and "Image URL" fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of other users' browsers. This allows an attacker to perform actions such as cookie theft or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Directly inserting malicious scripts into the Quote and Image URL fields when creating or editing a quote through the plugin's interface.
    - Importing a CSV file containing malicious scripts into the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Requires a high privilege user such as an administrator.
    - Alternatively, an attacker could trick an administrator into importing a malicious CSV file.
