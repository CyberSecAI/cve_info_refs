The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Fast Food Ordering System 1.0".

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Description field when creating a new category within the Master List.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization for the "Description" field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Description" field.
- When a user accesses the list with the malicious payload, the script will be executed in the user's browser.
- The attacker can steal cookies or perform other actions within the user's session.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs access to the CMS admin panel of the Fast Food Ordering System.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload, such as `<img src="" onerror="alert(document.cookie)">`.
- The attacker injects this payload into the "Description" field when creating a new category.
- The payload is stored in the application's database.
- Every time any user views the category containing the malicious payload, the JavaScript will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have admin access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker must be able to navigate to the "Master List > Category List > Create New" section within the application.
