- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS Visualization login dialog provides different feedback for invalid user and password attempts, which allows an attacker to determine if a user exists or not. This is due to an observable discrepancy in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-204 Observable Response Discrepancy. The vulnerability lies in the feedback mechanism of the login dialog, which reveals user existence based on the response to different authentication attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can enumerate valid usernames, which can be used in further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access to the CODESYS HMI, TargetVisu, or WebVisu components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected system and the ability to interact with the login dialog. Low attacker skill is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
