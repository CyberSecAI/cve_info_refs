- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape parameters before outputting them in AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page viewed by a user, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints. Specifically, the `swpm_validate_email` and `swpm_validate_user_name` actions are vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and induce a user to click on them. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
