- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement. This occurs through an AJAX action accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries. The provided proof of concept demonstrates the potential to extract sensitive data, like user credentials (username and password hashes) from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via an AJAX action (`youzify_media_pagination`) accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and requires the ability to send a crafted HTTP request with the malicious payload to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
