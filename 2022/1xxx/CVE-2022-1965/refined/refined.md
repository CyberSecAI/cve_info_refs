*   CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions. The system fails to handle an invalid crafted request correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): While the primary impact is a denial of service, there is a specific consequence that the file referenced by the malicious request could be deleted if it exists on the controller.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Network-based attacks: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   Crafted Requests: Attackers need to send a specially crafted request to the CODESYS Control runtime system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Low Skill Level: The document indicates that an attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-1965 details a vulnerability where a crafted request can lead to improper error handling and file deletion on the target CODESYS system. Although the primary impact is denial of service, the ability to delete files makes this a more serious issue. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable but requires prior successful authentication.
