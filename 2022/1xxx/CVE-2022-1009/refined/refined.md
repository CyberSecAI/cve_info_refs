- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape a configuration parameter before outputting it on an admin page. This occurs when a malicious preset configuration file is uploaded.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, potentially leading to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user with administrative privileges uploads a crafted malicious configuration file through the plugin's configuration settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to create and upload a malicious configuration file. They also need to trick an admin into uploading this file.
