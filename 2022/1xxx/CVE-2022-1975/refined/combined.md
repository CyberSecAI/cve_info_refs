NFC: netlink: fix sleep in atomic bug when firmware download timeout

```
There are sleep in atomic bug that could cause kernel panic during
firmware download process. The root cause is that nlmsg_new with
GFP_KERNEL parameter is called in fw_dnld_timeout which is a timer
handler. The call trace is shown below:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/sched/mm.h:265
Call Trace:
kmem_cache_alloc_node
__alloc_skb
nfc_genl_fw_download_done
call_timer_fn
__run_timers.part.0
run_timer_softirq
__do_softirq
...

The nlmsg_new with GFP_KERNEL parameter may sleep during memory
allocation process, and the timer handler is run as the result of
a "software interrupt" that should not call any other function
that could sleep.

This patch changes allocation mode of netlink message from GFP_KERNEL
to GFP_ATOMIC in order to prevent sleep in atomic bug. The GFP_ATOMIC
flag makes memory allocation operation could be used in atomic context.
