Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1329

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of capability checks in the Elementor plugin's onboarding module. Specifically, the `upload_and_install_pro` function, which allows the installation of a plugin from a user-supplied zip file, was accessible to any authenticated user, regardless of their WordPress role. This was due to the `admin_init` hook not properly validating user permissions before executing the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the absence of capability checks on AJAX actions, specifically within the `maybe_handle_ajax` function. This allows unauthorized users to trigger functions intended for administrators.
2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `upload_and_install_pro` function allows for the upload of arbitrary zip files, leading to the possibility of installing malicious plugins.
3.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading a crafted plugin zip, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can gain complete control over the WordPress site by uploading and activating malicious plugins.
2.  **Site Defacement:**  Less sophisticated attackers can use functions to modify the site name, logo, or other settings.
3.  **Malware Installation:** Attackers can install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software on the server.
4.  **Data Theft:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
2.  **File Upload:**  The malicious plugin is sent as a zip file in the `fileToUpload` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be logged into the WordPress site with any user role, even a subscriber.
2.  **Nonce Value:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid nonce value associated with the vulnerable functionality. This nonce is exposed in the source code of admin pages for all logged in users.
3.  **Ability to craft a malicious plugin zip file:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious plugin zip that, when installed, will execute the code needed to take over the site.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was introduced in Elementor version 3.6.0 and patched in 3.6.3.
* The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" with a CVSS score of 9.9.
*  Wordfence premium customers received a firewall rule protecting against this issue on March 29, 2022.
* The vulnerability is located in the `core/app/modules/onboarding/module.php` file.
* A proof-of-concept exploit is provided, demonstrating how to upload a plugin via an HTML form.
