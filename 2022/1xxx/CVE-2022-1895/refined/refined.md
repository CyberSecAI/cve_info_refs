- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deactivating the construction mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF check, allowing unauthorized state changes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to deactivate the construction mode, potentially exposing a partially developed site to the public.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can create a malicious web page with an embedded iframe that targets the vulnerable plugin functionality, leveraging a victim's active admin session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious website or open an email that contains the crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
