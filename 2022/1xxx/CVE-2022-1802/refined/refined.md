Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2022-1802:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from using an untrusted string from a content process to index into a JavaScript Object. Specifically, the code `this.notifications[origin][notification.id] = notification;` in `NotificationDB.jsm` was vulnerable because if the `origin` was the string `__proto__`, the code would pollute the prototype of the Object, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The primary weakness is the ability to pollute the prototype of the JavaScript `Object`. This is achieved by using a content-controlled string as a key during object indexing.
- **Lack of input validation/sanitization:** The code doesn't validate or sanitize the `origin` string before using it as an index to the `notifications` object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sandbox Escape:**  By polluting the `Object.prototype`, an attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into a privileged context. This allows for a sandbox escape, which could lead to more severe consequences, including arbitrary code execution.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could leverage the polluted prototype to achieve execution of arbitrary code in the context of the parent process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The attack vector involves sending a crafted message from the content process to the parent process, specifically a message that includes the "__proto__" string as the `origin` field of a notification object.
- **Content Process Control:** An attacker would need control of a content process to send the malicious message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Content Process Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a content process. This may involve having the user browse a malicious website or otherwise compromise the content process.
- **Understanding of Prototype Pollution:** The attacker must understand prototype pollution vulnerabilities to craft the exploit and achieve code execution.

**Additional details from the provided text:**
- The vulnerability was a spot fix for a Pwn2Own 2022 sandbox escape.
- The code was initially fixed by using `Object.create(null)` to avoid the prototype pollution.
- It was discovered that a follow-up patch was necessary to fix the issue for existing profiles where notifications were restored from disk, and thus had not been created using `Object.create(null)`.
- The vulnerability affected multiple versions of Firefox, Firefox ESR, Firefox for Android and Thunderbird.
- A test case is provided to verify if the fix is effective by using the browser toolbox to send a crafted message and check if a property is `undefined`.
- The vulnerability was considered security critical.
- The initial patch was not considered risky and was easily backportable to older branches.

In summary, this vulnerability allowed an attacker to leverage prototype pollution to escape the browser's sandbox by using a crafted message via interprocess communication to corrupt the Object prototype and inject malicious JavaScript code.
