The provided content relates to CVE-2022-1848.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check on the length of the password during user creation or modification. The `User` object had a `@Max` annotation on password which was not actually being enforced.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate password length validation: The system did not properly enforce the maximum password length, allowing excessively long passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion: An attacker could potentially create users with extremely long passwords, leading to resource exhaustion on the server due to the amount of data to process and store.

**Attack vectors:**
- User registration: An attacker could register a new user with an oversized password.
- User modification: An attacker could potentially modify the password of an existing user to an oversized value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify user accounts via the user registration or update endpoint.
