- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the "Header Title" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user (Admin+) can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users when they view the affected post grid/carousel, leading to potential data theft, account hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin privileges can create or edit a post grid/carousel and insert a malicious script in the "Header Title" field. The XSS payload is then stored in the database and is triggered when users view the post grid/carousel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative or high-privilege access to the WordPress site to create/edit the Grid/Carousel and insert the malicious payload.
