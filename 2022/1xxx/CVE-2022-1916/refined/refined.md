- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it in the response of an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to user session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `more_data` parameter, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The AJAX action is accessible to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious payload and get a victim to visit the URL (or if they can cause the URL to be requested in the context of a user session)
