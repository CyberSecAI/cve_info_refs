- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF checks on multiple settings update functions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the plugin settings to arbitrary values. This can include changing the site privacy status, landing page URL, membership options, and advanced settings including custom login URL.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in admin into submitting a crafted form via a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious website or clicking a malicious link that submits the crafted form.
