# GetSimple Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)

#### Description

Persistent XSS (or Stored XSS) attack is one of the three major categories of XSS attacks, the others being Non-Persistent (or Reflected) XSS and DOM-based XSS. In general, XSS attacks are based on the victim’s trust in a legitimate, but vulnerable, website or web application.GetSimple CMS does not filter the content correctly at the "content" module, resulting in the generation of stored XSS.

#### Affects CMS
