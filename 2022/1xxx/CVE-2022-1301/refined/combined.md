## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Contact Slider < 2.4.7 - Editor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Text to Display settings of sliders, which could allow high privileged users such as editor and above to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a Slider, select the "text or HTML" for the " What would you like to display?" setting (at the bottom of the page), and put the following payload in the "Text to display" field while in Text mode: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in the post/page where the slider is embed/displayed

### Affects Plugins
