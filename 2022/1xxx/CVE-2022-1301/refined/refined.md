- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the "Text to Display" settings of sliders.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "Text to Display" field, which will then be executed in the context of the user's browser when a page or post with the slider is viewed. This can lead to various malicious actions, including session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the plugin's settings interface. Specifically, by creating or editing a slider, selecting "text or HTML" for "What would you like to display?", and inserting a malicious payload in the "Text to display" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least editor-level privileges to access the slider settings.
