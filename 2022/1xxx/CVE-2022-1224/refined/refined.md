The provided content relates to CVE-2022-1224.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is incorrect privilege assignments in phpIPAM, specifically related to administrative access requirements in various scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the inconsistent enforcement of administrative privileges across different parts of the application. Several scripts were missing checks to ensure that the user had sufficient privileges. Specifically, in files like `generate-hosts.php`, `generate-mysql.php`, `generate-xls.php`, `access_logs.php`, `error_logs.php`, `show-logs.php`, and `export-subnet.php` there were missing checks to verify if the user was logged in and had admin privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could potentially gain access to sensitive data or perform actions they are not authorized to perform. For example, a user without administrative privileges could potentially generate exports, access logs, or other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve directly accessing the vulnerable scripts without having administrative privileges. The vulnerability can be exploited by navigating to any of the mentioned files without being authenticated with admin rights.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be an authenticated user within the system but without administrative rights.
