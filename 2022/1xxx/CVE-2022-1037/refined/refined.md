- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate that images added via URLs are external, allowing the use of local URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially make requests to internal resources, which could lead to information disclosure or further attacks, such as port scanning, access to sensitive data, etc.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker uses the plugin's "Save storage by using external image URLs" feature in the WordPress admin panel (/wp-admin/media-new.php) to input a local URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges in the WordPress application.
