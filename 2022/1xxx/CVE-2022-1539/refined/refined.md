- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and validate data when generating the CSV export, which allows for the injection of formulas or malicious hyperlinks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSV Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By injecting malicious content, an attacker can achieve code execution via Microsoft Excel DDE function, or leak data via maliciously injected hyperlinks, when the exported CSV is opened by a user using software like Excel or OpenOffice.
- **Attack vectors:** A contributor injects a payload into a Post title. An administrator then exports the data as a CSV file, which, when opened, processes the injected formula.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A contributor level access to the vulnerable WordPress site is required to inject the payload, an administrator must export the data. The vulnerable plugin version must be installed.
