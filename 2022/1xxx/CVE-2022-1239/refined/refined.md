- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HubSpot plugin does not properly validate the proxy URL provided to its proxy REST endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially accessing internal services or resources that are not meant to be publicly accessible.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the `/wp-json/leadin/v1/proxy` REST endpoint with a crafted `proxyUrl` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the `edit_posts` capability or higher (Contributor role or higher in WordPress).
