{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient validation of the 'css' parameter, which is used to fetch CSS files from external URLs. The code doesn't properly validate the URL's scheme or port before making a request. Additionally, it fails to adequately sanitize the CSS content, leading to potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
    "Insufficient URL validation",
    "Lack of proper input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially use the vulnerable endpoint to make requests to internal resources or external servers, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the 'base' and 'css' parameters, an attacker could make the server fetch arbitrary URLs. The vulnerable code fetches CSS file based on the 'css' parameter, without sanitizing it, and uses it within a curl request. An attacker can provide an internal IP, and port, to potentially retrieve internal services.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with controlled `base` and `css` parameters."
