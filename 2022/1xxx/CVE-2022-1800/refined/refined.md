- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize the `cpt` POST parameter before using it in a database query when exporting post data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this case, the Proof of Concept demonstrates that an attacker can cause a delay by injecting a `sleep` command, indicating successful SQL injection.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request with a malicious `cpt` parameter to the `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=pmxe-admin-export` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrator privileges to access the "All Export > New Export" screen in the WordPress admin panel.
