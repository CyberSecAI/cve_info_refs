## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Slide Anything < 2.3.44 - Editor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape sliders' description, which could allow high privilege users such as editor and above to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a Slider with the plugin and put the following payload in a Slide Description while in text mode: <script>alert(/XSS/);</script>
The XSS will be triggered when editing the slide again, as well in any page/post where the slider is embed
