- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the sliders' description.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with editor privileges or higher can inject malicious scripts into the slider description. When other users view the slider (either while editing it or when embedded on a page/post), the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user with editor or higher privileges can create or edit a slider and insert the malicious script in the slide description while in text mode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least editor level access to the WordPress site.
