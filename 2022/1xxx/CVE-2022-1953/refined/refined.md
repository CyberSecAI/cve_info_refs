- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin uses user-supplied input in a file path without proper validation before passing it to the `unlink()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability, arbitrary file deletion.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server that are owned by the web server's user.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted AJAX request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `mkl_pc_generate_config_image` action and a malicious `data` parameter containing a path to the file to be deleted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server.
