Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1392:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `video-synchro-pdf` WordPress plugin not properly validating the `p` parameter before using it in an include statement. This lack of validation allows an attacker to control the file path being included.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is LFI, where an attacker can include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem via the vulnerable `p` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable script (`tout.php`) with a crafted `p` parameter.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed without requiring any authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker does not require any credentials or prior access to exploit the vulnerability.
