- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cimy Header Image Rotator plugin lacks CSRF protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can make a logged-in administrator change the plugin's settings, potentially leading to arbitrary changes to the site's appearance or functionality. The provided proof of concept shows that an attacker could, for example, change the image links, link target or other settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted form that modifies the plugin settings. This can be done by embedding a malicious form in a website or email.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking a malicious link.
