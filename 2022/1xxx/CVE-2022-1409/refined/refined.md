The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1409.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The VikBooking Hotel Booking Engine & PMS plugin does not properly validate uploaded images. This allows a user with high privileges, such as an administrator, to upload a PHP file disguised as an image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure file upload:** The plugin lacks proper validation of file types during upload. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended image upload restriction and upload other file types (in this case, PHP).
*   **Lack of sanitization:** The uploaded file, containing malicious PHP code, is not sanitized or checked, allowing it to be stored on the server.
*   **Insufficient access control:** While the upload requires administrator privileges, it still allows malicious code execution if an administrator is compromised.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote code execution:** By uploading and accessing the crafted PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, website defacement, malware distribution, etc.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST request:** The attacker crafts a multipart/form-data POST request to the admin panel interface `/wp-admin/admin.php`.
*   **File Upload:** Uploads a malicious file with a valid GIF header, containing PHP code.
*   **Bypassing File Extension Check:** The filename of the malicious file is named "phpinfo.php," and the file is uploaded with the content type "image/gif."

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Administrator access:** The attacker must have administrator-level privileges on the WordPress website to upload the malicious file.
*   **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to craft a multipart/form-data HTTP POST request to upload the malicious file.
