## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Clipr <= 1.2.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape its API Key settings before outputting it in an attribute, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the API Key settings of the plugin: '></script><script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
The XSS will be triggered when viewing the settings again, as well as all frontend pages

### Affects Plugins
