The provided content contains a commit from the Microweber project that addresses potential XSS vulnerabilities, it does not directly reference a CVE. However, it shows the changes made to mitigate this issue.

Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `ApiController.php` file, specifically the `module()` function, and within the `XSSClean.php` helper class. Input is not properly sanitized before being processed, leaving it vulnerable to XSS injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code was vulnerable to XSS because it did not properly sanitize input strings and array keys before using them. Malicious JavaScript code could potentially be injected through these inputs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing specially crafted input values via API requests. If successful, this could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
- By sending malicious parameters to the `module()` API endpoint of the Microweber application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the Microweber application. This might require some level of access to the application's API endpoints.

**Technical Details:**
- The commit modifies `ApiController.php` to sanitize input values and keys by replacing `<`, `>`, `"`, and `'` with `-` before further processing.
- The commit also modifies `XSSClean.php` by adding `onfullscreenchange` to the list of event attributes to filter.
- The `cleanArray` function within `XSSClean.php` is used to recursively sanitize array values. The `clean` function within `XSSClean.php` is used to sanitize individual string values, removing potentially harmful attributes and tags.
