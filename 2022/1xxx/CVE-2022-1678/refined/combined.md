tcp: fix possible socket leaks in internal pacing mode

This patch is addressing an issue in stable linux-4.19 only.

In linux-4.20, TCP stack adopted EDT (Earliest Departure
Time) model and this issue was incidentally fixed.

Issue at hand was an extra sock_hold() from tcp_internal_pacing()
in paths not using tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue()

Jason Xing reported this leak and provided a patch stopping
the extra sock_hold() to happen.

This patch is more complete and makes sure to avoid
unnecessary extra delays, by reprogramming the high
resolution timer.

Fixes: [73a6bab](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/73a6bab5aa2a83cb7df85805e08bc03b4065aea7) ("tcp: switch pacing timer to softirq based hrtimer")

| [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=61#c3)  cambda   alibaba_cloud_group  2022-05-20 14:36:28 UTC  ``` On my Linux server, I found abnormal memory usage and very large TCP in-use socket statistics in /proc/net/sockstat. The Linux version is 4.19 and the TCP congestion control algorithm is BBR without fq. The 'ss' command didn't list so many sockets, so it could be socket leak. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=61#c4)  larryshi   admin  2022-05-20 14:51:11 UTC  ``` confirm from upstream: - [https://lore.kernel.org/all/CANn89i+7-wE4xr5D9DpH+N-xkL1SB8oVghCKgz+https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/76fb2bc3-9f9c-cf5c-02f5-3a5da2312ad1@gmail.com/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/all/CANn89i%2B7-wE4xr5D9DpH%2BN-xkL1SB8oVghCKgz%2Bhttps%3A//lore.kernel.org/netdev/76fb2bc3-9f9c-cf5c-02f5-3a5da2312ad1%40gmail.com/T/) - [https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200602080425.93712-1-kerneljasonxing@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/all/20200602080425.93712-1-kerneljasonxing%40gmail.com/)  fix in Upstream: <https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0a70f118475e037732557796accd0878a00fc25a>  fxi in Anolis: <https://gitee.com/anolis/cloud-kernel/commit/bed537da691b> ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=61#c5)  Shiloong   admin  2022-05-20 14:57:30 UTC  ``` This bug has been fixed in ANCK-4.19 release 4.19.91-25.7, as following commit:  <https://gitee.com/anolis/cloud-kernel/commit/bed537da691b> ``` |  |

Subject: [[PATCH] tcp: fix TCP socks unreleased in BBR mode](#r)
Date: Tue,  2 Jun 2020 16:04:25 +0800	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20200602080425.93712-1-kerneljasonxing@gmail.com> (<raw>)

From: Jason Xing <kerneljasonxing@gmail.com>

TCP socks cannot be released because of the sock_hold() increasing the
sk_refcnt in the manner of tcp_internal_pacing() when RTO happens.
Therefore, this situation could increase the slab memory and then trigger
the OOM if the machine has beening running for a long time. This issue,
however, can happen on some machine only running a few days.

We add one exception case to avoid unneeded use of sock_hold if the
pacing_timer is enqueued.

Reproduce procedure:
0) cat /proc/slabinfo | grep TCP
1) switch net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control to bbr
2) using wrk tool something like that to send packages
3) using tc to increase the delay in the dev to simulate the busy case.
4) cat /proc/slabinfo | grep TCP
5) kill the wrk command and observe the number of objects and slabs in TCP.
6) at last, you could notice that the number would not decrease.
