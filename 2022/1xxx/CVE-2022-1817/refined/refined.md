- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Badminton Center Management System does not properly filter user-supplied content at the "userlist" module, specifically when editing a user's details.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the system that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by an authenticated administrator modifying a user's username via the "userlist" module by injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript into the username field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges to access the user management panel and edit user information. They also need knowledge of the vulnerable field to inject the payload successfully.
