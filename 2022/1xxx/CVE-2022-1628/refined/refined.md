> **Plugin Slug:** cds-simple-seo
> **Affected Versions:** <= 1.7.91

This confirms the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied data, specifically in the SEO social and standard title parameters. This lack of proper handling allows malicious code to be stored in the database and later executed in the browser of a user accessing the affected page.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   -  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is Stored XSS. Malicious scripts are stored persistently, in this case within the plugin's settings and page/post meta data.
   -  **Insufficient Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user inputs for the SEO title parameters before storing them in the database.
   -  **Insufficient Output Escaping:** The plugin fails to properly escape the stored values before displaying them on web pages. This means the malicious scripts, stored in the database, are output to the browser without being sanitized.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   -   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser that visits affected pages.
   -   **Session Hijacking:** The injected scripts can potentially steal session cookies, allowing an attacker to impersonate a logged-in user, including administrators.
   -   **Defacement:** It can be used to deface website content, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions.
   - **Data Theft:** An attacker can potentially steal sensitive information.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   -   **Plugin settings:** The vulnerability resides in how the plugin saves and displays user data within SEO social and standard titles.
   -   **Injection via post/page meta data**: The injected scripts can be stored into post/page meta data and later executed when an administrator accesses the affected page/post.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   -   **Authenticated User with Contributor or higher privileges:** An attacker must be able to access the plugin's settings, or modify the page/post meta data. This is achievable for users with contributor or higher level permissions.

**7. Additional Information from the Content**
The provided content also includes:
*   A fix for the vulnerability is included in version 1.7.92. This fix includes a function to sanitize strings with `htmlspecialchars`.

**Summary of CVE-2022-1628:**

The "Simple SEO" WordPress plugin was vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient sanitization and output escaping of SEO title parameters. This vulnerability allowed authenticated attackers (Contributor and above) to inject malicious JavaScript into posts/pages, posing a risk of session hijacking, defacement, and other malicious activities to site visitors and administrators. The vulnerability was resolved in version 1.7.92 by implementing proper output sanitization.
