Prevent redirect to Host (2) ([#19175](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/19175)) ([#19186](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/19186))

```
Backport [#19175](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/pull/19175)

Unhelpfully Locations starting with `/\` will be converted by the
browser to `//` because ... well I do not fully understand. Certainly
the RFCs and MDN do not indicate that this would be expected. Providing
"compatibility" with the (mis)behaviour of a certain proprietary OS is
my suspicion. However, we clearly have to protect against this.

Therefore we should reject redirection locations that match the regular
expression: `^/[\\\\/]+`
