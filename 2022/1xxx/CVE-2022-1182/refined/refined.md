- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape various parameters before using them in SQL statements within AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLI)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. This is a high severity vulnerability due to the potential compromise of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Authenticated users (such as subscribers) can access vulnerable AJAX actions via HTTP requests with malicious SQL injection parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have a user account with at least subscriber privileges.
