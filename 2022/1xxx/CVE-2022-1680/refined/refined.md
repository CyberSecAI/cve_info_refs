{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to modify a user's email address via the SCIM provisioning API, even if the user already exists. This bypasses the expected verification or authorization mechanisms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation or authorization when modifying user email addresses through the SCIM API.",
      "Lack of proper checks to prevent the hijacking of existing accounts through email changes."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can take over any user account within a GitLab group that has SSO enabled by exploiting the SCIM provisioning API. By changing the email address associated with a target account, the attacker gains control.",
     "attack_vectors": [
          "Using a POST request to /api/scim/v2/groups/:group_path/Users/ to create a SCIM user with the target user's username and email",
          "Using a PATCH request to /api/scim/v2/groups/:group_path/Users/:id to change the SCIM provisioned user's email to one the attacker controls"
        ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a group administrator with group SSO enabled. They must also know the username and email address of the targeted user."
