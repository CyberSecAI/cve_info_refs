- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it in the response of an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL with the malicious script in the `gallery_current_index` parameter is sent to the vulnerable endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` using the `wpda_gall_load_image_info` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link.
