- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Type mismatch during JSON decoding. When a `Codable` type requests initialization of an integer field, `JSONDecoder` attempts to coerce the JSON value. If the JSON value is a floating-point number, `JSONDecoder` uses different methods for validation and casting, leading to a deterministic crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - CWE-241: Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type
    - CWE-351: Insufficient Type Checking
    - CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). A crafted JSON document with type mismatches can cause the application to crash. This can lead to violations of invariants in services and other error conditions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted JSON document with a floating-point number in a place where an integer is expected. This is often done through HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with a crafted JSON body to a service using vulnerable versions of `swift-corelibs-foundation`.
