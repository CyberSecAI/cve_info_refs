Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1587:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `get_recurse_data_length` function within `pcre2_jit_compile.c`. This function is involved in the Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation of regular expressions.
*   The issue arises during the handling of recursions in JIT-compiled regular expressions, specifically due to duplicated data transfers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read, meaning the program attempts to access memory outside of the allocated buffer. This can lead to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read could allow an attacker to read sensitive information from the application's memory.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** It is also mentioned that the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the JIT compilation of regular expressions. Thus, an attacker would need to provide a specially crafted regular expression that would trigger the vulnerable code path during compilation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to control the regular expression that is being processed by the vulnerable version of `pcre2`.
*   No specific privileges or authentication appear to be required beyond being able to supply input to the application utilizing the vulnerable library.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of PCRE2 prior to 10.40.
*   Patches have been released by several distributions including Fedora and Debian, as well as by NetApp for affected products.
*   The issue is related to JIT compilation, suggesting that if the JIT functionality is disabled, the vulnerability may not be exploitable.
*   The fix for this issue involves addressing the duplicated data transfers.
