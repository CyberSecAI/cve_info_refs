## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Theme-Demo-Importer < 1.1.1 - Admin+ Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

The plugin does not validate the imported file, allowing high-privilege users such as admin to upload arbitrary files (such as PHP) even when FILE\_MODS and FILE\_EDIT are disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

1. Navigate to: Appearance >Import Demo Content > Theme Demo Importer > Manually upload the demo files
2. Use the XML file import option to upload a PHP file containing this content:
<?php phpinfo();?>
3. Find the file at https://example.com/wp-content/uploads/YYYY/MM/your-file.php

### Affects Plugins
