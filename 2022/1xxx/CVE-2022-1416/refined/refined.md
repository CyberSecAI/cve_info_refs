```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The error message from failed pipeline runs on the \"/pipelines/new\" page does not properly HTML encode the project and file names before rendering it in the view using v-safe-html.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "HTML Injection",
    "CSS Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and CSS code into the error message displayed on the pipeline creation page. This can be used to:\n  - Redirect users to malicious websites by overlaying the page with an invisible link.\n  - Create fake login modals to phish user credentials by mimicking the look and feel of legitimate GitLab password prompts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker configures a project to use a pipeline configuration file with a malicious name/path containing HTML and CSS injection payloads. When a user attempts to run a pipeline with the misconfigured file, the error message will render the injected code on the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to modify the pipeline configuration settings, particularly the pipeline file path, within a GitLab project. This can be achieved through direct project settings manipulation or by using the compliance framework feature."
