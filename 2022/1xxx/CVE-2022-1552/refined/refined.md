Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-1552:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is incomplete implementation of "security restricted operation" sandbox when a privileged user was maintaining another user's objects. Specifically, `Autovacuum`, `REINDEX`, `CREATE INDEX`, `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, `CLUSTER`, and `pg_amcheck` commands activated the protections too late or did not activate them at all during the process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Privilege Separation:** The commands didn't properly isolate the execution of user-defined functions from the privileges of the user initiating the commands (e.g. a superuser performing actions on a table owned by another user).
*   **Late Activation of Protections:**  Security measures were enabled too late in the execution flow, or not at all, leaving a window for malicious code execution. This was especially true for relation-enumerating operations which failed to correctly assume the owner's permissions before running functions associated with found relations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema could execute arbitrary SQL functions with the privileges of a superuser. This could result in full control of the database instance.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information could be revealed through the execution of malicious SQL functions.
*   **Data Modification:** Malicious SQL functions could alter or add data to the database.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploitation could potentially lead to DoS conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Defined Functions:** The primary attack vector involves malicious user-defined SQL functions that are executed by the vulnerable commands.
*   **Manipulated Objects:**  An attacker would need to create objects (tables, indexes, etc.) in at least one schema they have access to, so the privileged operation triggers execution of malicious functions under superuser identity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Database User Access:** The attacker needs to have a database user account with the ability to create non-temporary objects.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker gains the ability to escalate privileges due to the missing "security restricted operation" sandbox.

**Additional Details from the Analyzed Content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability is present in PostgreSQL versions 10 to 14 (before the fixes). NetApp products are also affected as they incorporate vulnerable versions of PostgreSQL.
*   **Red Hat Patch:** Red Hat provided updated packages for various RHEL versions and SCLs to address the vulnerability.
*   **Upstream Fix:** The fix was released in PostgreSQL versions 14.3, 13.7, 12.11, 11.16 and 10.21. It involves setting user ID just after locking a relation, and to ensure correct use of security restrictions for user defined functions called by `Autovacuum`, `REINDEX`, `CREATE INDEX`, `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`, `CLUSTER`, and `pg_amcheck` operations.
*   **Workaround:** Red Hat suggested disabling `autovacuum`, not manually running the vulnerable commands and not restoring from pg_dump outputs to workaround this vulnerability, while updating was not possible.
*   **NetApp:** NetApp has clarified which of their products are not affected by this vulnerability.
