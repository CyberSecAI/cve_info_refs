- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape Slide descriptions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website, leading to potential actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to have admin or other high-privileged user access to create/edit a carousel and add a slide with malicious JavaScript code in the description field. The XSS is triggered on pages/posts where the carousel is embedded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be a high-privileged user (e.g., admin).
