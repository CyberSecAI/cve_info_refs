Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes related to potential security vulnerabilities in the context of CVE-2022-1784. This commit seems to address multiple issues, including a state redirect issue and a CORS check issue.

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - **Incorrect Redirect Handling:** The `ProxyServlet` was not correctly handling redirects, potentially leading to issues when fetching resources.
   - **Insecure CORS Check:** The regex used for the CORS check was not robust enough.
   - **State Redirect Issue:** There appears to be a problem related to how state is handled in the `AbsAuth` component.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Open Redirect:** The original implementation could potentially be abused through manipulated redirect URLs.
   - **CORS Bypass:** A weak CORS check could allow unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
   - **Authentication Bypass**: An incorrect state redirect in `AbsAuth` could lead to authentication bypass or session manipulation.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Data Exposure:**  A successful CORS bypass could expose user data.
   - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Incorrect redirect handling could enable a MitM attack by directing the user to a malicious site.
   - **Unauthorized Access:** An authentication bypass could allow unauthorized users to access or modify data.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Malicious URL Redirection:** Attackers could craft URLs that redirect to attacker-controlled servers to intercept data or perform other malicious actions.
   - **CORS Manipulation:** Attackers could bypass the CORS check by manipulating the referer header.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Position:** An attacker may require the ability to intercept or manipulate network requests to exploit the redirect vulnerability and the CORS bypass.
   - **Knowledge of Target:** Knowledge of specific endpoints and the application's redirection logic is likely needed.

**Detailed Technical Changes:**

*   **`AbsAuthServlet.java`:**
    *   The `isAbsolute()` method logic was simplified.
    *   The method now returns true for malformed URLs to block them.
*   **`ProxyServlet.java`:**
    *   `setInstanceFollowRedirects(false)` is set instead of true.
    *   The redirect loop condition was changed from `status == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_PERM || status == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_MOVED_TEMP` to `(int)(status / 10) == 30`.
    *   The regex for the CORS check has been modified with a start anchor (`^`) to prevent subdomain bypass.
*   **`Utils.java`**:
    *   Added imports for `MalformedURLException`, `URL`, `UnknownHostException`, and `InetAddress`, which might be related to other changes or future additions.
*   **`electron.js`**:
     *   Added `disableBlinkFeatures: 'Auxclick'` to some `webPreferences` configurations.
     * Added code to disable navigation using `contents.on('will-navigate')`.
     * Added code to restrict window creation with `contents.setWindowOpenHandler`, only allowing empty windows (`about:blank`) or external URLs.
*  **`app.min.js`**:
    *  The version was bumped from 18.0.6 to 18.0.7.
*  Other files include changes to the build process (`build-release.yml`), the changelog, and some minor changes to `service-worker.js`

**Summary of Patches:**

*   **Redirects:** The changes to `ProxyServlet.java` aim to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities by disabling automatic redirects in the `HttpURLConnection` and implementing manual redirect following with a limit.
*   **CORS:**  The modification in the CORS check in `ProxyServlet.java` enforces a more specific match for the allowed domains.
*   **State Redirect:** The changes in `AbsAuthServlet.java` addresses a potential flaw in how the state is handled during redirection in the authentication process.
* **Electron Navigation & Windowing:** The changes in `electron.js` are designed to harden the electron app, prevent navigation, and limit the creation of new windows
