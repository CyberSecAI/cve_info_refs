  "CVE-2022-1942": {
    "description": "Heap-based Buffer Overflow in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.",
    "details": "The vulnerability occurs due to Illegal memory access and leads to a buffer over-read vulnerability in the utf_ptr2char function. This flaw allows an attacker to input a specially crafted file, leading to a crash or code execution.\n\nCan open a cmdline window from a substitute expression.\n\nThe AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.\nTo generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.\nThe AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code.

    "affected_versions": "< 8.2.5043",
    "patched_versions": ">= 8.2.5043",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the `vim_regsub_both()` function and a heap-based buffer overflow in `vim_strncpy` and `find_word`, which can be triggered via a substitute expression when a text or buffer is locked, by opening a command-line window. A text change between computing the length and copying the text is the root cause.",
