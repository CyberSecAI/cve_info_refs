Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that a `CI_JOB_TOKEN` can be used to clone a project's wiki, even when the wiki is set to be visible only to project members. This occurs because the CI job has access to the project's wiki regardless of the wiki's visibility settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect access control:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the CI job token is given more access than it should have. It bypasses the intended visibility settings for the project's wiki, allowing unauthorized access.
- **CI_JOB_TOKEN scope:** The `CI_JOB_TOKEN` should be restricted to the project it is associated with, not also grant access to the project wiki when the visibility setting does not allow it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Confidential Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored within a project's private wiki, that should be restricted to project members.

**Attack vectors:**
- **CI Pipeline Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` file within their own project or a public project where they have permission to create pipeline jobs.
- **HTTP Git clone with CI_JOB_TOKEN**: The attacker abuses the fact that they can use the CI_JOB_TOKEN to git clone a project wiki via HTTP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs an account on GitLab to create a project and pipeline jobs.
- **Basic knowledge of GitLab CI/CD:** The attacker needs some familiarity with the GitLab CI/CD pipeline to create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- **No need for membership in the victim project**: The attacker does not need to be a member of the project whose wiki they are targeting, as the vulnerability is in the CI token itself and the fact that it can bypass the wiki's visibility setting.

**Additional notes:**
- The attacker clones the target wiki using the CI_JOB_TOKEN using the http protocol via `git clone http://gitlab-ci-token:$CI_JOB_TOKEN@gitlab.com/company/api.wiki.git`.
- This vulnerability was initially reported as a bug but wasn't properly fixed the first time, as mentioned in the "Report" section, referencing a previous report #887755.
- The vulnerability was reported on 2021-01-10 by `shells3c`, but the fix was not implemented correctly.
