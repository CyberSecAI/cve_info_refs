**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper restriction of XML external entity references within the Delta Electronics DMARS software when processing specific project files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The software does not adequately restrict references to external XML entities, which are then processed by the software. This is a classic XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves an attacker crafting a malicious project file containing XML external entity references and tricking the user into loading the project file in vulnerable versions of DMARS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious project file to the targeted user, which requires user interaction to open the file in the vulnerable software. It is not remotely exploitable. An attacker does not require special privileges to perform the attack.

**Additional Details:**
The advisory indicates the vulnerability exists in four different instances within the software. The advisory also provides mitigation strategies, including updating to the latest software version, segmenting networks, and not using project files from untrusted sources.
