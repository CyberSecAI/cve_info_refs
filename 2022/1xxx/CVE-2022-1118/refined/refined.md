Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data. The affected Rockwell Automation products (Connected Component Workbench, ISaGRAF Workbench, and Safety Instrumented Systems Workstation) do not limit the objects that can be deserialized.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious serialized object.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the system where the malicious file is opened.

*  **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires user interaction. An attacker must craft a malicious serialized object and then trick a user into opening it using one of the vulnerable applications.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious file to a local user. The user needs to open this file using one of the vulnerable applications. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
