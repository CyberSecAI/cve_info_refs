- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin settings are not properly escaped, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to the lack of output sanitization of the plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who access the vulnerable plugin settings page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings, such as "Exclude posts IDs". When a user with admin or other high privileges views these settings, the injected script will execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or another user with high privileges to modify the plugin settings. The attacker must also have access to the WordPress admin panel to modify plugin settings.
