Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The SVG Support plugin doesn't properly handle SVG files loaded via a URL. Specifically, it fails to sanitize the `onmouseover` event attribute within the SVG file when the SVG is included on a page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious SVG code is stored within a post/page and executed when a user interacts with the SVG element.
*   **Insufficient Sanitization:** The plugin's sanitization of SVG files is inadequate, failing to remove or neutralize potentially harmful event attributes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser by crafting a malicious SVG file.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Malicious scripts can steal cookies, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Defacement:** The website can be defaced, or users can be redirected to malicious websites.
*   **Data Theft:** Sensitive user data can be extracted and sent to an attacker-controlled server.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **SVG URL Injection:** The attacker embeds a malicious SVG via a URL when inserting an image into a WordPress post or page.
*  **CSS Class Trigger:** The XSS is triggered when the 'style-svg' CSS class is applied to the image block via the "Additional CSS class(es)" field in the image block's advanced settings.
*  **User Interaction:**  The XSS is activated when a user moves their mouse over the SVG image, triggering the `onmouseover` event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Author-level Access:** The attacker needs at least "Author" role privileges on the WordPress site, which allows the attacker to create posts with images.
*   **Ability to specify external URLs:** The attacker must be able to set an image source to a URL pointing to their malicious SVG file.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the SVG Support plugin prior to 2.5.
*   The proof of concept (PoC) involves creating a post, inserting an image, using a URL to a malicious SVG file, and adding the 'style-svg' CSS class to the image's advanced settings.
*   The provided example SVG code contains an `onmouseover` event with the `alert(/XSS/)` payload.
*   The plugin's settings affect whether the vulnerability is exploitable, with certain setting combinations leading to successful XSS attacks. Specifically,  "Restrict to Administrators" needs to be true, "Enable Advanced Mode" also true, "Sanitize SVG" also true, and the CSS Class to target must be empty or 'style-svg' for the exploit to work.
