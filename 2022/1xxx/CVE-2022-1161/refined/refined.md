- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that Studio 5000 Logix Designer writes user-readable program code to a separate location than the executed compiled code. This allows an attacker to modify the user-readable code without affecting the compiled code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted control sphere (CWE-829). Specifically, the separation between user-readable code and executed compiled code allows for a mismatch between what the user intends and what the controller actually executes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to modify user programs. A user could then unknowingly download those modified elements containing malicious code. The modified code could cause the controller to operate in an unintended and potentially dangerous manner.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs the ability to modify a user program. This could be achieved through network access to the engineering workstation running Studio 5000 Logix Designer, or by gaining access to the project file (.acd).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the user program code. This implies some level of access to the engineering environment where the programs are created and modified, or access to the project files. The attack can be performed remotely with low complexity, given that the attacker has the initial required access.
