Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the WordPress plugin "Safe SVG" relying on the `Content-Type` header provided in the HTTP request to determine if an uploaded file is an SVG. This header can be easily manipulated by an attacker, allowing them to bypass the plugin's SVG sanitization process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure reliance on `Content-Type` header:** The plugin trusts the `Content-Type` header sent by the client, which can be easily spoofed or changed to a different MIME type.
- **SVG sanitization bypass:** By providing a manipulated `Content-Type` header (e.g., `image/png`) along with a malicious SVG file, the plugin's sanitization process is bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers can upload malicious SVG files containing JavaScript code. When these files are accessed (e.g., through a media library), the embedded JavaScript is executed in the user's browser within the website context, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **XML attacks:** Depending on how the uploaded SVG files are further used by the website, other XML-based attacks might be possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack vector involves crafting a POST request to the WordPress upload handler (`/wp-admin/async-upload.php`) with a manipulated `Content-Type` header.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file as part of the multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Upload Capability:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the WordPress website (e.g., through an account with contributor or editor privileges).
- **Knowledge of HTTP:**  The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests with specific headers and multipart form data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in version 1.9.10 of the Safe SVG plugin.
- The Proof of Concept section provides an example HTTP request demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The fix implemented in the plugin utilizes the core WordPress function `wp_check_filetype_and_ext` to accurately determine the file type based on its contents rather than relying on the `Content-Type` header.
