- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape its search input before outputting it in an attribute on the event dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the event dashboard, which will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `search_keywords` parameter. The user must click on the malicious link for the attack to be successful.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a victim to click on the malicious link. Any authenticated user of the WordPress website running the vulnerable plugin is affected.
