Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1561:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of URL parameters within the `github.com/luraproject/lura/v2/router/gin` package. This lack of sanitization allows a malicious user to manipulate the backend URL of a pipe by sending crafted URL requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is that the URL parameters are not being correctly validated and sanitized before being used to construct backend URLs.
- **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data:**  The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-471, which refers to the modification of data that should be immutable. In this case, the backend URL configuration is being modified through malicious user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Backend Vulnerability Exposure:** The primary impact is that it exposes the consumed backend to potential vulnerabilities. By manipulating the backend URL, an attacker might be able to redirect requests to a malicious endpoint, potentially leading to data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or other attacks against the backend service.
- **No Direct Impact on KrakenD:** The vulnerability does not directly affect the KrakenD API gateway itself. However, it puts the backends it proxies at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted URL Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted URL requests that include malicious URL parameters.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to send these crafted requests to the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the KrakenD/Lura instance.
- **No authentication is required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or special privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as `LOW` severity with a CVSS v3 score of 3.6.
- **Affected Versions:** Lura and KrakenD-CE versions prior to v2.0.2 and KrakenD-EE versions prior to v2.0.0 are affected.
- **Mitigation:** The vulnerability is fixed in Lura v2.0.2, KrakenD CE v2.0.2 and KrakenD EE v2.0.0 or higher.
- **Researcher:** The vulnerability was discovered by Github user Fepame.
