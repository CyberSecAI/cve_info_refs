**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly references CVE-2022-1209 and provides detailed information about the vulnerability. This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of URLs supplied in the social fields of user profiles in the Ultimate Member plugin.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to an open redirect. Specifically, it does not properly sanitize user-supplied URLs in social media fields (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube, SoundCloud, VKontakte) allowing a malicious user to redirect victims to arbitrary websites, including phishing sites. The '@' character can be used to bypass the host detection of some URL components.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites, such as phishing pages, potentially leading to credential theft or malware infection.
    *   An attacker could craft a link to log out a user, if the logout link is known and used in a social media field.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker would need to create a user account on a website using the vulnerable Ultimate Member plugin.
    *   The attacker would then need to input a specially crafted URL containing an open redirect payload in one of the social media fields.
    *   When another user clicks on this crafted link within the profile, they would be redirected to the attacker's arbitrary external URL.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  The attacker needs to be a registered user.
    *   The attacker doesn't require elevated privileges.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerability and how to exploit it.
    *   The attacker can be remote.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Ultimate Member plugin versions up to and including 2.3.1.
*   Version 2.3.2 fixed the open redirect vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ruijie Li.
*   The fix includes improved validation for social fields and URLs, using placeholders, and disallows use of the logout URL in such fields.
