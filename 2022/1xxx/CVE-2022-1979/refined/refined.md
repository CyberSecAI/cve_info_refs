The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Product Show Room Site" version 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly filter user-supplied input in the "Message" field of the contact form. Specifically, it doesn't sanitize the input before storing it in the database and displaying it to administrators in the inquiries page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and later executed in the browsers of users viewing the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the message field. When an administrator views the inquiries page, this code will be executed in their browser.
- This can lead to various impacts such as:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing administrator cookies and taking over the administrator's session.
  - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the web application.
  - Phishing: Displaying fake login forms or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
  - Data theft: Stealing sensitive information displayed on the affected page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Message" field of the contact form available on the web application's contact page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the contact form, which is publicly accessible on the web application.
- The attacker needs no special privileges.

The attacker injects the XSS payload `<script>alert(111)</script>` through the message field, which then gets stored. When an admin views the inquiries page, the payload executes, triggering an alert.
