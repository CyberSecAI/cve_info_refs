- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges, such as an admin, can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages or settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to have admin privileges on the WordPress site and access the plugin's settings page (/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=ps\_manage\_opts). They would then insert the malicious payload in the "Force Public Pages" settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** High privilege user such as admin.
