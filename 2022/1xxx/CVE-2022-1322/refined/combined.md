## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Coming Soon - Under Construction <= 1.2.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, which could allow high-privileged users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

As admin, put the following payload in the "More text information" settings of the plugin: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in the frontend when in Coming Soon Mode
