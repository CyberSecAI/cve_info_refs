- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker, with admin privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's "More text information" setting. The XSS is triggered when the Coming Soon mode is enabled and a user visits the frontend of the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the WordPress site.
