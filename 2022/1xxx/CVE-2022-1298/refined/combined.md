## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Tabs Responsive < 2.2.8 - Editor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape Tab descriptions, which could allow high privileged users with a role as low as editor to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a Tab via the plugin, and put the following payload in a Tab description: "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in posts/pages where the Tab is embed via the [TABS\_R id=XXXX] shortcode
