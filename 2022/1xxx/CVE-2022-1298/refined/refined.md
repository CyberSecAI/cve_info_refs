- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape tab descriptions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into tab descriptions, which will then execute when a user views a page or post where the affected tab is embedded. This can lead to various malicious activities, like session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating or editing a tab through the plugin and including a malicious payload (e.g., `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>`) within the tab description. The XSS is triggered when the tab is rendered on the page using the `[TABS_R id=XXXX]` shortcode.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have a user role with editor privileges or higher to create or modify tab descriptions via the plugin.
