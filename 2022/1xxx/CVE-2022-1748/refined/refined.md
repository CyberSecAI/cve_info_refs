Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1748:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476). The vulnerability occurs when an OPC UA session is closed before some of the invoked methods are finished, leading to the dereference of a NULL pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, resulting in the application crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be triggered by calling several OPC UA methods and closing the OPC UA session before the methods complete.
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
- The attack has a low complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish an OPC UA session with the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected products:**
- Softing OPC UA C++ SDK <= V6.00
- Softing Secure Integration Server <= V1.22
- Softing edgeConnector <= V3.10
- Softing edgeAggregator <= V3.10
- Softing OPC Suite: Version 5.2
- Softing uaGate: Version 1.74

**Mitigations:**
- Disable the possibility of establishing unauthenticated sessions to the OPC UA server.
- Remove the optional methods “ResendData” (ns=0;i=12873 and ns=0;i=12871) und “GetMonitoredItems” (ns=0;i=11492 and ns=0;i=11489) from address space.
- Disable all OPC UA methods by calling Application::instance()->setEnableServiceGroup(EnumServiceGroup\_Methods, false) during server initialization.
- Update to the fixed versions: Softing OPC UA C++ SDK V6.10, Softing Secure Integration Server V1.30, Softing edgeConnector V3.50, and Softing edgeAggregator V3.50.
