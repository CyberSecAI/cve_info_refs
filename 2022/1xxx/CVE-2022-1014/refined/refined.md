- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied POST data before using it in an SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the JSON payload sent to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database by injecting malicious SQL code. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. As shown in the proof of concept, the attacker can retrieve user login credentials from the `wp_users` table.
- **Attack vectors:** Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `WP_Contacts_Manager_call` action with the `type=get-contact` parameter, and a malicious JSON payload containing SQL injection in the `id` field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only need to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
