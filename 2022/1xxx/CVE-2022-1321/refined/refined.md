- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Malicious users with administrator privileges can store malicious JavaScript code, leading to XSS attacks when `unfiltered_html` is disallowed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker, with administrator privileges, can inject malicious JavaScript code into the "Advanced Blocking" tab, specifically within the "Block HTTP Referer's" section, using the “Add Referer” field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges on the WordPress site.
