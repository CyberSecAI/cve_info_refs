Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security-related changes in the commit `c63f3a0` of the `jgraph/drawio` repository:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The commit addresses several potential vulnerabilities related to URL handling, redirects, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). Specifically, the issues include:

1.  **Insecure Redirect Handling:** The `ProxyServlet` was previously following redirects using `HttpURLConnection.setInstanceFollowRedirects(true)`, which can be insecure if not handled carefully as it automatically follows any redirect.
2.  **Inconsistent URL Validation**: The `AbsAuthServlet` uses a try/catch block to check if the given url is an absolute URL which could lead to bypassing the validation.
3.  **CORS Regex:** The regular expressions used for checking allowed CORS origins were too permissive and did not correctly validate the domain, potentially allowing requests from unexpected origins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Redirects:**  Following redirects without restrictions can expose the application to open redirect vulnerabilities, where an attacker could redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **URL Validation bypass:** The try/catch block within `AbsAuthServlet.java` could have allowed bypassing the url validation.
*  **Permissive CORS:** Insecure CORS configuration allows access from potentially malicious origins, enabling Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data breaches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Open Redirect:** An attacker could exploit the insecure redirect handling to redirect users to a malicious website, potentially leading to phishing attacks or malware distribution.
*   **Bypassing URL validation:** An attacker could use a malformed URL that would be improperly handled by the try/catch block.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** With insecure CORS, an attacker could perform XSS by injecting malicious JavaScript code on the client-side. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Data breaches**: With insecure CORS an attacker could perform data breaches by retrieving private data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated URLs:** An attacker could manipulate the URL to trigger redirects to malicious sites.
*   **Cross-Origin Requests:**  An attacker could craft malicious requests from a different origin, exploiting the permissive CORS configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the URL used in the application to trigger the redirect vulnerability.
*   For CORS exploitation, the attacker needs to be able to make requests from a malicious domain that could be incorrectly allowed by the existing CORS regex rules.

**Changes Made in the Commit:**

*   **`ProxyServlet.java`:** The `setInstanceFollowRedirects` was set to `false`. The logic has been updated to explicitly follow redirects. The redirect status check was changed to verify all 30x redirect codes instead of only permanent and temporary redirects.
*   **`AbsAuthServlet.java`:** The logic has been changed to properly check if the given url is an absolute URL by returning the boolean from the `uri.isAbsolute()` method. The catch block has been removed.
*   **`Utils.java`**: Added imports for the new sanitize URL function
*   **`ProxyServlet.java`:** The regex for CORS checking has been changed to use `^` to explicitly check the beginning of the string, making it more restrictive. The regex for `draw.io`, `diagrams.net`, and `quipelements.com` domains were updated.
*   **`electron.js`**: Added additional security configurations to disable navigation and limit the creation of new windows.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The commit message mentions "Fixes issue in state redirect of AbsAuth" which relates to the fix in `AbsAuthServlet.java`
*   The commit message mentions "Changes regex for CORS check" which relates to the fix in `ProxyServlet.java`
*   The commit message also mentions "Sets setInstanceFollowRedirects(false) in proxyservlet" which relates to the fix in `ProxyServlet.java`

This commit addresses several important security concerns, hardening the application against potential redirect vulnerabilities and cross-origin attacks by properly validating URLs, restricting redirects, and securing the CORS configuration.
