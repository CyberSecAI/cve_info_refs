Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-1405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization when processing a specific project file in Delta Electronics' CNCSoft software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The software does not adequately validate the size of input data when processing a project file, which can lead to writing beyond the boundaries of a stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2022-1405) could allow for arbitrary code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted project file that triggers the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable, requiring local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted project file to the CNCSoft software.
- User interaction is required, as the user needs to open the malicious project file.
- The attacker requires local access to the machine running the vulnerable software.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text also mentions another vulnerability, CVE-2022-1404 (Out-of-Bounds Read), but that is not the focus of this analysis.
- Delta Electronics has released an updated version (v1.01.32 or later) of CNCSoft to address the vulnerabilities.
- The advisory encourages users to be cautious of potentially malicious project files and follow security best practices for avoiding social engineering attacks.
