- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the affected products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write. This occurs when the software attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer, leading to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to send a specially crafted packet that may result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote. An attacker with access to the EtherNet/IP network can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the EtherNet/IP network and does not require any user interaction or specific privileges. The attack complexity is low.
