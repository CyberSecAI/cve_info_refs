- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter (`id`) before outputting it back in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which can be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking the link. No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.

The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) URL that demonstrates the vulnerability:
`https://example.com/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mailerlite_main&view=edit&id=1%22%3Eaaaa%3Csvg%2Fonload%3Dprompt%281%29%3E`
This URL shows how the `id` parameter can be manipulated to inject Javascript code.
