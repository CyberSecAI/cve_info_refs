- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape the `trans_edit` parameter before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By manipulating the `trans_edit` parameter in the URL when an agent edits a transaction. The vulnerable URLs are:
    - `https://example.com/workstation/?transactions=open_transactions&trans_edit=SQL_INJECTION_PAYLOAD`
    - `https://example.com/workstation/?transactions=open_agent_transactions&trans_edit=SQL_INJECTION_PAYLOAD`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in agent.
