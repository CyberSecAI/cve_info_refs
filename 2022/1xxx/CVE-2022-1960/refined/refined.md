- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "MyCSS" does not implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly updating the plugin's settings, potentially leading to arbitrary changes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uses a crafted form submitted through a web browser while the administrator is logged into the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page or trigger the crafted form submission.
