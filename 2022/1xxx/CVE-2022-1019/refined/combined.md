PSIRT Record Number

Overview

The  WebCTRL®  building  automation  system  is  a  powerful  web-based  platform  that
provides facility managers with software tools to keep occupants comfortable, manage
energy  conservation  measures,  identify  key  operational  problems,  and  analyze  the
results.

An open redirect vulnerability (CWE-601) was discovered affecting our Automated Logic’s
WebCTRL® server’s Help pages.  An open redirect vulnerability is when a malicious actor
can redirect a web application’s user to a malicious webpage in their control.

Impact

CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

Solution

The vulnerability is mitigated by Content Security Policy in WebCTRL® server version 7.0
–  “October  29,  2020  -  cumulative  patch”  and  later.  It  is  recommended  that  customers
upgrade their WebCTRL® software to the latest supported version.

Mitigation

As a manual work around users can add the CSP header/meta tag to each “index.htm”
files in each of the directories under “<install_dir>/webroot/_common/lvl5/help/*”. These
are the main index files for each help for each program/tool.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Frameset//EN"

"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/frameset.dtd">
