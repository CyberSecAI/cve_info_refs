- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize, validate, and escape various parameters before using them in an SQL statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality impact.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via HTTP GET request to the vulnerable plugin's admin page with a crafted SQL injection payload in the `s` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access the vulnerable page.
