- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `PHP_SELF` PHP variable before outputting it in an attribute within an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious sites, or performing other unwanted actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `PHP_SELF` variable, which is then reflected back into the page's HTML without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and lure a user into clicking on it, typically through social engineering or by injecting the link into a website or email. The user needs to be logged in to access the admin page.
