- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not set `window.opener` to `null` when opening external links in a new window or tab.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Tabnabbing vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious website that can access the original website through the `window.opener` object, potentially leading to phishing or data theft.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker creates an external link that, when clicked, opens in a new tab/window.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject/create a link to an external website. The user must click this link, which will open a new tab or window to the attacker's malicious site.
