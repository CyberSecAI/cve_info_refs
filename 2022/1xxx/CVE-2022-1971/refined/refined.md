- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape image settings, specifically the "Alt & Title Text" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users who interact with the vulnerable areas, leading to potential information theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Alt & Title Text" field of an image within a gallery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an administrator or other high-privileged user account to edit gallery settings. The `unfiltered_html` capability must also be disallowed.
