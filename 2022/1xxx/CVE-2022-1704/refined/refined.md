Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE). Specifically, the software parses XML in the backup/restore functionality without proper XML security flags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core vulnerability is an XXE (XML External Entity) injection vulnerability. This occurs because the software processes external entities in the XML input during the backup/restore operation, allowing an attacker to manipulate XML parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of file contents. An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the server by injecting malicious XML that references these files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the backup/restore functionality of the Inductive Automation Ignition software. An attacker needs to supply a crafted XML file during the restore process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a restore process with their crafted XML file.
- The CVE description indicates that the attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H).
- The attack can be performed remotely (AV:N) and requires low attack complexity (AC:L).

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory provides affected versions: all versions of Inductive Automation Ignition from 8.1 up to, but not including 8.1.8, and all 7.9 versions prior to 7.9.21.
- The advisory notes that no public exploits targeting this vulnerability are known.
- The advisory recommends upgrading to Inductive Automation Ignition version 8.1.9 or later and 7.9.21 or later to remediate this vulnerability.
- The advisory mentions this vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low complexity but requires high privileges on the target system to exploit the backup/restore functionality (as per CVSS vector string).
