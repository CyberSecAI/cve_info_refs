Based on the provided content, the commit `347ad614507183035d188ba14427bc162419778c` in the OpenEMR repository addresses multiple potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. The changes involve sanitizing user inputs before displaying them on the page. Specifically, the commit introduces the `jsText()` and `jsAttr()` functions which encode text for safe use in HTML context as well as within HTML attributes, respectively.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data before being rendered in the HTML. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of the user's browser when they visit the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The code was vulnerable to XSS because it was directly inserting unsanitized user inputs into HTML, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Lack of Contextual Output Encoding:** The code lacked proper encoding of output data based on the context of use (e.g., HTML body, HTML attributes).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:

*   **Steal user session cookies:** This would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim.
*   **Redirect the user to a malicious site:** This is a common method for phishing or distributing malware.
*   **Modify the content of the page:** This can be used for defacement or to trick users into performing actions they didn't intend to.
*   **Execute arbitrary JavaScript:** This can be used to perform virtually any action within the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious input via forms:** The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript in form fields such as category name (`newname` in `pnadmin.php`), plan title (`obj.plan_title` in `plans_config.php`), or rule titles (`obj.rule_title` in `plans_config.php`).
*   **Stored XSS:** Once the malicious input is stored in the database, it will be executed every time the affected page is viewed by another user.
*   **Manipulated database data:** If an attacker has access to the database they can directly inject malicious payloads

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to input data into the application. This could involve access to administrative panels or other parts of the application that allow for data entry.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges as the vulnerability lies in how the data is displayed.

**Specific Code Changes and Their Implications:**

*   **`interface/main/calendar/modules/PostCalendar/pnadmin.php`:**
    *   The line `$output->Text(\_PC\_ADD\_CAT . $newname . '.');` was changed to `$output->Text(\_PC\_ADD\_CAT . text($newname) . '.');`. The `text()` function is used to encode the `$newname` variable, which is user-supplied category name. This is meant to prevent the injection of HTML into the output.
*   **`interface/super/rules/controllers/browse/view/plans_config.php`:**
    *   Several instances where plan and rule titles were output without sanitization have been changed to use `jsText()` and `jsAttr()` functions. These functions encode the data for display in the HTML and within the HTML attributes, respectively. For example, the following were changed:
        *   `'<option id="' + obj.plan_id + '" ... >' + obj.plan_title + '</option>'` to  `'<option id="' + jsAttr(obj.plan_id) + '" ... >' + jsText(obj.plan_title) + '</option>'`
        *   `'<option value="' + obj.rule_id + '" ...>' + obj.rule_title + '</option>'` to `'<option value="' + jsAttr(obj.rule_id) + '" ...>' + jsText(obj.rule_title) + '</option>'`
    *   The encodeURIComponent function is used when building URL parameters, specifically for the selected plan, to prevent URL injection attacks
    *   There was a typo in the code `alert(<?php echo xlj('Error'); ?>);`, which was corrected to `alert('<?php echo xlj('Error'); ?>');` to output a translated string.
*   **`interface/super/rules/www/js/cdr-multiselect/ui.multiselect.js`**:
    *   Similar to changes in `plans_config.php`, the code was modified to use `jsText()` when outputting text, for example `title="'+option.text()+'"` was changed to `title="' + jsAttr(option.text()) + '"`.
*   **`library/classes/TreeMenu.php`:**
    *   The code uses `text()` to sanitize `promoText` and node text, preventing XSS.

**Summary:**

The commit addresses multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities by encoding the user supplied data before displaying it in different contexts. The changes show a good understanding of the risks of unsanitized user data, and implements output encoding using specific functions (`text()`, `jsText()` and `jsAttr()`) to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
