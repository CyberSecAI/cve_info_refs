  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2022-1961",
    "description": "The Google Tag Manager for WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the `gtm4wp-options[scroller-contentid]` parameter found in the `~/public/frontend.php` file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.15.1. This affects multi-site installations where unfiltered_html is disabled for administrators, and sites where unfiltered_html is disabled.",
    "affected_versions": "<= 1.15.1",
    "fixed_version": "1.15.2",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient escaping of the `gtm4wp-options[scroller-contentid]` parameter.",
     "vulnerability_details":{
       "weakness": "The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input when storing the `gtm4wp-options[scroller-contentid]` parameter in the database, which is later echoed in a JavaScript block on the front-end.",
        "impact": "An attacker with administrative privileges can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of all users accessing any page on the vulnerable website.",
        "attack_vector": "The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator privileges and then modifies the scroll tracking settings to include an XSS payload in the Content ID input.",
        "required_capabilities": "Administrative user access to modify plugin settings.",
         "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the plugin echoes the unsanitized value of `gtm4wp_options[scroller-contentid]` into the JavaScript code block in the frontend.php file. This is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious script is stored in the database."
