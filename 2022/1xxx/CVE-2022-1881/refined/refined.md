Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Octopus Server's project export functionality.
*   **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control when handling project export requests. Users can download project exports without having the necessary permissions to access the project itself.
*  **Impact:** Unauthorized users can gain access to project export data of projects they should not have access to. This could potentially include sensitive configuration information and other project data.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A user with access to the Octopus Server can attempt to download project exports from other projects within the same space, even without permissions to those projects.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be a valid user of the Octopus Server and have the ability to make requests to download a project export. The attacker must be within the same "Space" as the targeted project.

**Summary of affected versions:**
*   All 2021.1.x and 2021.2.x versions
*   All 2021.3.x versions before 2021.3.13021
*   All 2022.1.x versions before 2022.1.2894
*   All 2022.2.x versions before 2022.2.6971
*   All 2022.3.x versions before 2023.3.2616
