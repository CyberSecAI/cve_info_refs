- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `idslider` parameter before using it in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=cubeslider` endpoint with a malicious `idslider` parameter, through Edit, Delete, and Save actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high-privileged user, such as an administrator, to exploit the vulnerability.
