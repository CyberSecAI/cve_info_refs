- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, read sensitive information, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted HTTP GET request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious `term` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is exploitable by sending a malicious HTTP request.
