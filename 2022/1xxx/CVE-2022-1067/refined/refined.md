The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1067.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel. Specifically, navigating to a specific URL containing a patient ID number will result in the server generating a PDF of a lab report without requiring authentication and without any rate limiting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication Bypass (CWE-288)
- Lack of proper access controls

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could disclose sensitive information, including HIPAA-protected PII. An attacker could potentially access lab reports of patients.

**Attack vectors:**
- Accessing a specific URL with a patient ID

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know or guess a valid patient ID and have network access to the affected system.
-  The CVSS vector string ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)) indicates that the attack vector is Network (AV:N), the attack complexity is Low (AC:L) and Privileges Required are Low (PR:L), User Interaction is None (UI:N), Scope is Unchanged (S:U), Confidentiality is High (C:H) and Integrity and Availability are None (I:N/A:N)
