Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1094:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of certain settings within the Amr Users plugin. Specifically, the "Name of list" field is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be stored and executed within the context of the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable field.
- The injected code will execute in the browsers of other users accessing the backend, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website's backend
    - Privilege escalation
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Name of list" field in the User Lists > Overview & tools page of the WordPress admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) within the WordPress site to access the vulnerable setting and inject the malicious payload. This also applies when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.

**Additional details:**
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject the malicious payload. The payload includes an HTML style attribute that triggers a JavaScript alert on animation start, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.59.4 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 3.4, which is classified as low severity.
