An attacker could construct a malicious request to bypass validation and access other URLs and potentially sensitive information within the domain, or possibly conduct further attacks. This flaw affects any client that utilizes a wildcard in the Valid Redirect URIs field.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2138971#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:00:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2022:8961 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8961](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8961)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2138971#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:00:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:8962 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8962](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8962)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2138971#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:00:54 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6 for RHEL 9  Via RHSA-2022:8963 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8963](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8963)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2138971#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 14:05:07 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.6.1  Via RHSA-2022:8965 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8965](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8965)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=2138971#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-12-13 15:30:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHEL-8 based Middleware Containers  Via RHSA-2022:8964 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:8964](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A8964)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=2138971#c11)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-12-14 09:48:42 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

### Description

A community user is reporting this:

```
so we finally upgraded our production server to Wilfdly 26.0.1
In the log I get frequent "Error while flushing N spans" errors (at debug level)
Is this something to worry about?
This is the default standalone configuration, and I did not intent to use any such feature.
Should I disable something, fix something, or just put the logger to Info level ?2022-03-30 17:08:09,041 {/} DEBUG org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.opentracing Error while flushing 1 spans
2022-03-30 17:08:17,042 {/} DEBUG org.wildfly.extension.microprofile.opentracing Error while flushing 2 spans
```

In galleon-pack/galleon-content/src/main/resources/feature\_groups/standalone.xml, we see

```

<feature-group name="microprofile-opentracing-jaeger"/>
```

This was  added by Emmanuel on 12/15/20 as part of [~~WFLY-14148~~](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/WFLY-14148 "Move microprofile-opentracing from wildfly-ee to wildfly"), so this been in the system for some time (so the user's upgraded-from-version is likely fairly old). It does strike me as odd that a MicroProfile subsystem is enabled in the standalone configuration.

Per Darran's request, we need to determine if this is, indeed, correct, and, if not, fix it before 26.1 Final ships.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2184161#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2023-04-03 19:06:52 UTC  ``` A parsing issue similar to [CVE-2022-3171](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-3171), but with textformat in protobuf-java core and lite versions prior to 3.21.7, 3.20.3, 3.19.6 and 3.16.3 can lead to a denial of service attack. Inputs containing multiple instances of non-repeated embedded messages with repeated or unknown fields causes objects to be converted back-n-forth between mutable and immutable forms, resulting in potentially long garbage collection pauses. We recommend updating to the versions mentioned above.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2184161#c2)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-04-18 19:01:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    EAPXP 4.0.0 GA on EAP 7.4.10  Via RHSA-2023:1855 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:1855](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A1855)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2184161#c5)  Avinash Hanwate    2023-05-24 04:36:12 UTC  ``` Created libphonenumber tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-37 [[bug 2209567](show_bug.cgi?id=2209567 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-3509 libphonenumber: protobuf-java: Textformat parsing issue leads to DoS [fedora-37]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2184161#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2023-06-27 11:29:05 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    RHINT Service Registry 2.4.3 GA  Via RHSA-2023:3815 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:3815](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023%3A3815)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2184161#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2023-06-27 15:43:36 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
