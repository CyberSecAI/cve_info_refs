- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some settings, specifically within the Mailchimp integration settings. This allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with administrative privileges (Admin+), can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When a user views the affected settings page, the malicious script is executed in their browser, potentially leading to actions on behalf of the user (such as data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically within Mailchimp integration settings. The malicious script is injected into input fields associated with Mailchimp settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access and modify the plugin settings and inject malicious code.
