The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities found in the Device42 Asset Management Appliance.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI) in Exago Reports:** An unauthenticated LFI vulnerability exists within the Exago reports component.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Autodiscovery Task:** A vulnerability allows for RCE through the creation of a crafted autodiscovery task, specifically targeting *nix/CISCO NX-OS devices, by embedding a malicious payload within the username field.
*   **RCE in Appliance Manager Component:** A separate RCE vulnerability is also identified in the appliance manager component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The LFI vulnerability enables attackers to bypass authentication by extracting valid session IDs of authenticated users.
*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):**  The vulnerability allows reading of arbitrary files on the system through the Exago reports component.
*  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Multiple RCE vulnerabilities are present, allowing the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate other users by using leaked session IDs.
*   **Admin-Level Access:**  Attackers can obtain admin-level access within the Device42 application.
*   **Full System Access:** Attackers can gain full access to the appliance's files and database via remote code execution.
*   **Root Privileges:** By chaining the vulnerabilities, an attacker can achieve remote code execution with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers require some level of access to the host network where the Device42 appliance is running.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The initial LFI vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.
*   **Crafted Payloads:**  Exploitation involves crafting malicious payloads for autodiscovery tasks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the Device42 appliance.
*   **Basic Knowledge:**  Basic understanding of network exploitation techniques is required.
*   **Unauthenticated Starting Point:** The attack can begin with unauthenticated access.

**Mitigation:**
*   Update Device42 appliance to version 18.01.00.
