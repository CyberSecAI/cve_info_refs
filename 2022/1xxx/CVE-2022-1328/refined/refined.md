```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `mutt_decode_uuencoded()` function in mutt does not properly validate the length character in uuencoded data, allowing it to read past the end of the input line and potentially beyond the input buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause `mutt_decode_uuencoded` to read arbitrary memory, potentially including private information like fragments of other messages, passphrases, or keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a specially crafted email with a malicious uuencoded part that provides an invalid length character.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send an email with a crafted uuencoded part to a user using Mutt."
