The provided content relates to CVE-2022-1275.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The BannerMan WordPress plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-controlled settings, specifically the text and textarea fields within the plugin's options page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization or output escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings.
- These scripts can be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page or settings page of the plugin, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on their behalf.
- The impact is more significant in multisite installations, where the `unfiltered_html` capability is typically disabled for administrators.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be an administrator of the WordPress site.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript payloads into the text and textarea settings fields of the BannerMan plugin configuration page (e.g., "Style your banner with CSS:" or "Background colour").
- The injected script is stored in the database.
- When the administrator or another user accesses the relevant page, the stored malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrator-level privileges on the WordPress website.
