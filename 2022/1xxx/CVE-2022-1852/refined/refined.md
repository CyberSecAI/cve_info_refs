      "content": "The fix is to move the call to kvm_vcpu_check_breakpoint() where it was before commit [4aa2691](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/4aa2691dcbd38ce1c461188799d863398dd2865d) (\"KVM: x86: Factor out x86 instruction\nemulation with decoding\") introduced x86_decode_emulated_instruction().\nThe other caller of the function does not need breakpoint checks,\nbecause it is invoked as part of a vmexit and the processor has already\nchecked those before executing the instruction that #GP'd.\n\nThis fixes [CVE-2022-1852](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xwhg-vr3r-8xvq \"CVE-2022-1852\").",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of breakpoints within the KVM x86 instruction emulation code. Specifically, when x86_decode_emulated_instruction() detects a breakpoint, it returns a value that is not an expected EMULATION_* value but rather what kvm_vcpu_check_breakpoint() writes in its argument. This causes x86_emulate_instruction to be called without having decoded the instruction, leading to a stale emulation context.",
