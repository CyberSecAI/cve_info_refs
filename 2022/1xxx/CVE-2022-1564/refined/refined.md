- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Custom Text settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the browsers of other users when they interact with the form settings. This can lead to various attacks like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious script through the "Custom Text" setting in the form's actions after submission.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a high privilege user such as an admin to be able to modify the form settings and insert the malicious payload.
