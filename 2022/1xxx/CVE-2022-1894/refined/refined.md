- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape and sanitize user-supplied settings, specifically within the "confirmation text" settings of a subscription form, when unfiltered_html is disallowed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings. When a user views or interacts with the affected popup (specifically, views/preview the subscription popup and clicks the subscribe button), the malicious script is executed in the user's browser. This could potentially lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts malicious HTML or JavaScript payloads and inserts them into the "confirmation text" settings of a subscription within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative or high-privilege access to the WordPress dashboard. They need the ability to create/edit subscription forms and configure the GDPR options.
