Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `onCellHtmlData` function within the `bootstrap-table-export.js` file, which was not properly sanitizing HTML data before exporting it. This could allow for the inclusion of malicious HTML in exported data. The commit addresses this by modifying the export function to not use the possibly unsanitized `htmlData` but instead use sanitized `text()` data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a potential XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious HTML into a cell, an attacker could have this malicious script executed when the data is exported and displayed. This occurs because the `onCellHtmlData` function was designed to directly return `htmlData` without sanitizing the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If exploited, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user viewing the exported data. This could lead to various malicious actions, including:
   - Stealing session cookies.
   - Defacing the user interface.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious HTML into the data displayed by the bootstrap-table. This could be through:
    - Input fields that are reflected back into the table.
    - Database values that are not properly sanitized when loaded into the table.
- Once the malicious HTML is in the table's data, the attacker would trigger an export of the data.
- The exported data would contain the malicious HTML, which could be executed when displayed or opened by a user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to insert malicious HTML into a `bootstrap-table` cell. This could be achieved by:
    - Compromising a data source or input form that feeds data to the bootstrap-table.
    - If the application allows user input in table cells, that could also be a vector.
- The attacker would also require knowledge of the system's export functionality to trigger the vulnerability.
