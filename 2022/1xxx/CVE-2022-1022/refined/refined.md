    {
      "cve": "CVE-2022-1022",
      "is_related": true,
      "content": "The provided commit diffs show the replacement of `v-html` with `v-dompurify-html` in multiple Vue.js components within the Chatwoot project. This indicates a vulnerability related to unsanitized HTML content being rendered, leading to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The commit addresses this by using DOMPurify to sanitize the HTML content before rendering it, mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the usage of `v-html` to render user-provided or dynamic content without proper sanitization, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if the content contains malicious HTML.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to: Data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the application, or other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "By injecting malicious HTML code within user inputs, database entries or configuration settings that are later displayed in the application UI via the vulnerable `v-html` bindings."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to inject malicious HTML content into areas of the application that are rendered using the vulnerable `v-html` directives. This could involve exploiting other vulnerabilities or having access to modify data that's rendered by the application."
