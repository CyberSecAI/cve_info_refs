Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability lies in the improper sanitization of the `$_POST['filter_tag']` parameter before it's used in an SQL query within the "Photo Gallery" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The plugin fails to properly escape user-supplied input (`filter_tag`), leading to an SQL injection vulnerability. The provided PoC demonstrates how a malicious user can inject arbitrary SQL code through this parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the `filter_tag` parameter before incorporating it into an SQL query.
- **Direct use of user input in SQL query**: The code directly concatenates the unsanitized input into the SQL query

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially use SQL injection to access sensitive data stored in the WordPress database including user information.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker can modify or delete data from the database.
- **Complete Compromise:** An advanced attacker could use the SQL Injection to potentially gain full control of the WordPress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically when the `action` parameter is set to `GalleryBox` and providing the malicious SQL code in `filter_tag`.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the WordPress application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable plugin and endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `photo-gallery` plugin and how to send the malicious payload to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with `action=GalleryBox` and crafted `filter_tag` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the injection using a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract database version information, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.3 of the plugin.
- The `filter_tag` parameter is used to filter images based on tags, and the vulnerability is present in how these tags are handled.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `BWGModelGalleryBox.php` file within the plugin.
- The fix involves ensuring the filter tags are treated as integers using `array_map('intval', explode(",", $bwg_filter_tag_temp))` and using `%s` placeholders and prepared statements.
