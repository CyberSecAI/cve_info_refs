- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Note Press` plugin does not sanitize and escape the `Update` parameter before using it in a SQL statement when updating a note via the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities. The CVSS score of 6.8 indicates a medium severity.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint with a malicious `Update` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The `Cookie: [admin+]` in the Proof of Concept indicates this requirement.
