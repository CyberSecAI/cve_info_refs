Based on the provided information, this commit fixes an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the NE (New Executable) parser of radare2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect bounds check when accessing module references in the NE file format. Specifically, the code was accessing the `modref` array using `rel.index - 1` without properly validating that `rel.index` is within the valid range. This can lead to reading out-of-bounds memory if `rel.index` is greater than `bin->ne_header->ModRefs`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read.
- Incorrect bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a crash when parsing a specially crafted NE file. This can be used to cause a denial of service.
- It may be possible to leak memory contents if exploited further.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted NE file with a crafted `rel.index` can trigger the vulnerability.
- An attacker could provide a malicious NE file to radare2 for parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious NE file to be parsed by radare2.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
