- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query when editing a product via the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited via a crafted `id` parameter in the URL when accessing the product editing functionality in the admin dashboard.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an administrator (or have the appropriate privileges) to access the vulnerable functionality.
