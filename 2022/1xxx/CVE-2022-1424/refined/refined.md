The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1424.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Ask Me" theme for WordPress does not perform CSRF checks for its AJAX actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities exist in the theme's AJAX actions. Specifically, the following actions are vulnerable:
    - `askme_update_options`: Wipes theme options.
    - `askme_reset_options`: Resets theme options to default.
    - `best_answer`: Allows selection/change of the accepted answer for a question.
    - `best_answer_re`: Allows unflagging a comment as accepted answer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can trick a logged-in user into performing actions on the site without their consent. This includes:
    - Wiping the theme options.
    - Resetting theme options to default.
    - Selecting or changing the accepted answer for a question.
    - Unflagging a comment as an accepted answer.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker exploits the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a logged-in user into submitting a crafted form or request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoints. This can be achieved through:
    - Embedding the crafted form/request in a malicious website or email.
    - Social engineering to trick the user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to visit a malicious link or website.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is in the lack of CSRF protection.
- The attacker must know the AJAX action names, and may also need to know the comment_id if exploiting the `best_answer` or `best_answer_re` endpoints. The comment_id is easily discoverable.
