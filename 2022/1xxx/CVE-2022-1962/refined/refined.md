Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-1962:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by uncontrolled recursion in the `go/parser` package when parsing Go source code with deeply nested types or declarations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack exhaustion: The recursive nature of parsing deeply nested structures leads to excessive stack usage, eventually causing a panic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can provide specially crafted Go source code with deeply nested structures to trigger a panic due to stack exhaustion, effectively crashing the program.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `go/parser` package's Parse functions (`ParseExprFrom`, `ParseFile`).
- An attacker needs to provide malicious Go source code with deeply nested types or declarations as input to these parsing functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply input to a program that utilizes the vulnerable `go/parser` package.
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a Go source file, or source code snippet, with deeply nested types or declarations.
- The attacker requires low privileges, can be local, requires no user interaction to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects `go/parser` versions before go1.17.12 and from go1.18.0-0 before go1.18.4.
- The fix for this vulnerability introduces a limit on recursion depth during parsing and scope depth during object resolution to mitigate the stack exhaustion issue. The recursion limit is set to 100,000, while the scope depth is limited to 1,000.
- The vulnerability was reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.
