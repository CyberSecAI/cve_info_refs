Hello gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.18.4 and 1.17.12, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 9 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* net/http: improper sanitization of Transfer-Encoding header

  The HTTP/1 client accepted some invalid Transfer-Encoding headers as indicating a "chunked" encoding. This could potentially allow for request smuggling, but only if combined with an intermediate server that also improperly failed to reject the header as invalid.

  This is CVE-2022-1705 and <https://go.dev/issue/53188>.
* When httputil.ReverseProxy.ServeHTTP was called with a Request.Header map containing a nil value for the X-Forwarded-For header, ReverseProxy would set the client IP as the value of the X-Forwarded-For header, contrary to its documentation. In the more usual case where a Director function set the X-Forwarded-For header value to nil, ReverseProxy would leave the header unmodified as expected.

  This is <https://go.dev/issue/53423> and CVE-2022-32148.

  Thanks to Christian Mehlmauer for reporting this issue.
* compress/gzip: stack exhaustion in Reader.Read

  Calling Reader.Read on an archive containing a large number of concatenated 0-length compressed files can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30631 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53168>.
* encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Unmarshal

  Calling Unmarshal on a XML document into a Go struct which has a nested field that uses the `any` field tag can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30633 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53611>.
* encoding/xml: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Skip

  Calling Decoder.Skip when parsing a deeply nested XML document can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  The Go Security team discovered this issue, and it was independently reported by Juho Nurminen of Mattermost.

  This is CVE-2022-28131 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53614>.
* encoding/gob: stack exhaustion in Decoder.Decode

  Calling Decoder.Decode on a message which contains deeply nested structures can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30635 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53615>.
* path/filepath: stack exhaustion in Glob

  Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-30632 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53416>.
* io/fs: stack exhaustion in Glob

  Calling Glob on a path which contains a large number of path separators can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  This is CVE-2022-30630 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53415>.
* go/parser: stack exhaustion in all Parse\* functions

  Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested types or declarations can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.

  Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-1962 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/53616>.

View the release notes for more information:

<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.4>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go website:

<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

`git checkout go1.18.4` and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Michael and Heschi for the Go team

go/parser: limit recursion depth

Limit nested parsing to 100,000, which prevents stack exhaustion when
parsing deeply nested statements, types, and expressions. Also limit
the scope depth to 1,000 during object resolution.

Thanks to Juho Nurminen of Mattermost for reporting this issue.

Fixes #53616
Fixes CVE-2022-1962

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
