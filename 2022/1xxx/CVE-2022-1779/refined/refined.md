- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Auto Delete Posts" lacks CSRF protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin doesn't validate that settings update requests come from legitimate users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly changing the plugin's settings, potentially leading to the deletion of posts, categories, and attachments.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form (as shown in the provided Proof of Concept) and tricks an authenticated administrator into submitting it while logged into their WordPress admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit a malicious page containing the crafted form.
