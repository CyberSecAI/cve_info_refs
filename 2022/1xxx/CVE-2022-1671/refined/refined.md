Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-1671

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `rxrpc` (Remote Procedure Call) module of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `rxrpc_preparse_s`, `rxrpc_free_preparse_s`, and `rxrpc_destroy_s` functions in `server_key.c` do not properly handle the case where the security type is `rxrpc_no_security`. When `rxrpc_no_security` is in use, the function pointers for server key parsing are not set, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when these functions are called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is a NULL pointer dereference when `sec->preparse_server_key`, `sec->free_preparse_server_key`, or `sec->destroy_server_key` is called, but `sec` is `NULL` because of the rxrpc_no_security setting.
- **Missing Input Validation/Checks:**  The code fails to check if the security context (`sec`) is valid before dereferencing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference leads to a kernel crash, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** An attacker with local access (e.g., a user on the system) can trigger the vulnerability using the `ioctl` system call. Specifically, the vulnerable code path is hit when creating or updating a key via `add_key` system call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system to use the `ioctl` and `add_key` system calls.
- **Capability to use the system calls:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code, and make system calls.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that `sec` is not NULL and that the function pointers are valid before dereferencing. The fix is specific to the `rxrpc_no_security` scenario.
- The NetApp advisories indicate that the affected products are NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC)
- The NetApp advisories also state that there are "no plans to address this vulnerability" for the affected products.
- The provided commit log from the kernel source tree describes the vulnerability and fix in detail.
- The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions up to 5.17.14

In summary, CVE-2022-1671 is a local privilege escalation leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `rxrpc` module due to a NULL pointer dereference.
