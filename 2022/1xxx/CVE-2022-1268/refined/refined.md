- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the response. Specifically, the `notice` parameter in the `donateextraSettings` page is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which are then executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the `notice` parameter containing JavaScript code. When a victim clicks on the malicious link or the crafted form is submitted, the script executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit a crafted URL or submit the malicious form. This could be achieved through phishing or other social engineering techniques. The attacker doesn't need any special access privileges to the vulnerable website.
