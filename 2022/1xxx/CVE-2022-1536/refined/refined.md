Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Automad system. Specifically, the system fails to sanitize the POST parameter used to modify the website title. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the website title field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected web application.
- This could allow attackers to perform actions such as:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious sites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of logged-in users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the website title field through a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface of the Automad system.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify website settings, specifically the website title.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable version of Automad is 1.10.9 and earlier.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting `<script>alert("home")</script>` into the website title field.
- The injected script is then triggered when the home page is visited.
