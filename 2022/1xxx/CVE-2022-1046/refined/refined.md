- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the form's 'Email to' field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 'Email to' field, which will be executed when a user edits the form. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or editing a form and inserting the malicious payload into the 'Email to' field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access the form creation/editing functionality.
