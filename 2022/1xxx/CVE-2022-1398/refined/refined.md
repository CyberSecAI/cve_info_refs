{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly validate that media added via URLs are external, allowing the use of internal URLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to lack of authorization and validation of URLs provided by users.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform blind SSRF attacks, potentially accessing internal resources or services not intended to be publicly accessible.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the 'Add medias from URLs' feature of the plugin. A user with subscriber privileges can submit a crafted request with an internal URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with at least subscriber privileges."
