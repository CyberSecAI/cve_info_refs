The provided content is related to a commit that modifies access control lists (ACLs) in OpenEMR. This commit, a2e918a, includes changes to several files to limit access to reports for front and back office users. However, there is no indication of a specific vulnerability in the description.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

*   **Root cause:** The commit aims to restrict access to patient reports and notes for specific user roles (Accounting and Front Office) by modifying the access control configuration. The intention is to improve data security and role-based access control.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   The commit addresses a weakness in the existing ACL configuration that allowed broad access to patient reports and notes to users who should not have such access.
    *   The changes are not related to any exploitable vulnerability but rather to configuration weaknesses in the authorization model.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Before the fix, unauthorized personnel with "front office" or "accounting" roles could potentially view patient reports and notes. This would be a breach of confidentiality.
*   **Attack vectors:** The commit does not introduce any new attack vectors.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** There's no active exploitation scenario here. The "attack" is implicit; those with access that they shouldn't have could view information that they shouldn't. The attacker is assumed to be a user with an "Accounting" or "Front Office" role, who now will have reduced permissions.

**Specific code changes:**

*   `acl_upgrade.php`:  Updates the ACLs to remove access to "Patient Report" for "Accounting" and "Front Office" groups, and remove write access to transactions and notes for "Front Office". It also shifts the "Patient Report" object within the "patients" section.
*   `interface/patient_file/report/custom_report.php`: Adds a check using `AclMain::aclCheckCore('patients', 'pat_rep')` to ensure the user has the necessary permission to view the custom report.
*   `library/classes/Installer.class.php`: Modifies the initial ACL setup during installation to remove "pat_rep" permissions for "front" and "back" office users during install.
*   `src/Common/Acl/AclExtended.php`: Introduces a new function `shiftAcl` to remove specific objects from an ACL.
*   `src/Gacl/GaclApi.php`: Modifies `shift_acl` to handle missing array keys to avoid errors.
*   `version.php`: Increments the `$v_acl` variable indicating the version of the access control list.

This commit implements a fix to a configuration issue, rather than addressing a vulnerability, therefore, it is not directly related to any specific CVE, since no vulnerability is being fixed, just a configuration problem.

Therefore the response is:
NOINFO
