Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1673:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization/escaping of the `error_envision` query parameter before outputting it on the checkout page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input (`error_envision` parameter) before including it in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts into the user's browser when they visit the checkout page with the crafted URL. This can lead to various impacts, including:
*   Stealing session cookies
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user
*   Redirecting the user to malicious sites
*   Defacing the website.
In this case the impact is rated as low confidentiality since only the user's browser is affected

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious script within the `error_envision` query parameter. This crafted URL can be distributed through various means, such as phishing emails or links on malicious websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not require any special privileges or access to the target system. They only need to entice the victim to click on a malicious URL containing the payload in `error_envision` parameter.
