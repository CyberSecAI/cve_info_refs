Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1007:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Advanced Booking Calendar plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `room` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the admin page, potentially leading to:
  - Stealing administrator cookies/sessions.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Defacing the website.
  - Performing other actions with administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `room` parameter.
- The victim (typically an administrator) needs to be tricked into clicking the malicious link while logged in to their WordPress admin panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with a reflected XSS payload in the `room` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `backend/seasons-calendars.php` file of the Advanced Booking Calendar plugin. Specifically, the `$_GET["room"]` parameter was not sanitized before being used in a `sprintf` call.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.1 of the plugin.
- The provided changeset from the plugin's trac shows that the fix involves using `esc_html()` to sanitize the output of `$_GET["room"]`.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 6.1, which is considered a medium severity.
