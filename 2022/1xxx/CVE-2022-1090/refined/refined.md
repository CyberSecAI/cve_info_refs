Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-1090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input within the settings of the "Good & Bad Comments" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to sanitize or escape its settings, which allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the plugin's configuration. This stored payload will then be executed when the settings page is loaded by another user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then executed in the browsers of other users who view the plugin settings.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites. Even though the vulnerability requires high privilege users such as admins, the exploitation could potentially lead to broader impact once an admin account is compromised.
- **Impact even with `unfiltered_html` disabled:** The vulnerability can be exploited even when the WordPress `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed for users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload via the plugin settings. Specifically, a user with high privileges (e.g. admin) can insert the payload in the plugin settings.
- The crafted XSS payload is stored in the database.
- When other users with access to the settings page load it, the stored payload is executed in their browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **High Privilege User:** The attacker must be a user with high privileges, such as an administrator, to modify the plugin settings where the malicious code is injected.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided proof of concept payload is: `"><img src onerror=prompt(/XSS/)>`. This payload leverages the `onerror` event handler of the `img` tag to execute JavaScript when the `src` attribute is invalid, resulting in the execution of `prompt(/XSS/)`, which would display a simple XSS alert in a userâ€™s browser.
- The vulnerability exists in the settings of the Good & Bad Comments plugin, specifically version 1.0.0 and earlier.
