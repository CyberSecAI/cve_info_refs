- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly escape user-controlled settings before outputting them in HTML attributes. Specifically, the "Field Name", "Popup Link" custom field settings and "Admin Email" settings, as well as other unspecified settings were vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to account takeover, session hijacking, data theft, and other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to be an administrator (or other user with high privileges) to modify the plugin's vulnerable settings, and then wait for an administrator or other high privilege user to access the page where the injected JavaScript would be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to have administrator privileges within the WordPress site using the vulnerable plugin.
