Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1163:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Link Name" and "URL" fields within the navigation bar administration panel of the MineWebCMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize the "Link Name" and "URL" input fields, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be used to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the web page
    - Perform other malicious actions within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to log in to the web application with administrative privileges.
- The attacker then navigates to the admin panel for managing the navigation bar.
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload (e.g. `<script>alert(1);</script>`) and inserts it into the "Link Name" and/or "URL" input fields when adding or editing a link (specifically when selecting "Drop-Down Menu").
- The XSS payload is then triggered when a user views the application's home page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the MineWebCMS application. This means they would need valid admin credentials to log in.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is located in the `admin/navbar` section of the application, specifically when adding or editing a link that is part of a dropdown menu.
- The application's admin input structure allows HTML injection or XSS in multiple places, according to the exploit description.
- The provided GitHub commit diff shows that the vulnerability was addressed by using `urldecode()` when displaying the values of the input, which was not the right way to solve XSS.
- The fix was introduced in commit `06ce52c20f208b0bbf24c6480d60332c9dd19428`.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-1163 is a stored XSS vulnerability in MineWebCMS 1.15.2. An authenticated admin can inject malicious script into the "Link Name" or "URL" field when creating or modifying a nav bar entry. When a user visits the home page, the injected JavaScript will execute.
