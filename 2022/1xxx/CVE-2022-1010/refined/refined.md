- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, specifically the "IdP EntityID / Issuer" setting under "IDP Metadata".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected page. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be an administrator (or another high-privilege user) and can inject the payload via the vulnerable settings page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have administrative privileges within the WordPress installation and the unfiltered\_html capability must be disallowed.
