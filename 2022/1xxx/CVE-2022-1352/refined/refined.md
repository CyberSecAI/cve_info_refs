  "CVE-2022-1352": {
    "related_content": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The GitLab Flavored Markdown (GFM) API did not properly enforce visibility permissions when processing issue references in markdown text.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Information disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated user could discover the titles of issues in projects where the issue visibility was set to 'Only Project Members'. This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability where private issue titles could be exposed.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted API request to the `/api/v4/markdown` endpoint, including a markdown string with issue references.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs no prior authentication or special permissions. They only need to know the project namespace and the issue number they wish to check."
