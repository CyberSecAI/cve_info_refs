# libinput: format string vulnerability when using xf86-input-libinput — GLSA **202310-14**

A vulnerability has been discovered in libinput where an attacker may run malicous code by exploiting a format string vulnerability.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/libinput** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.20.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.20.1** |

### Background

A library to handle input devices in Wayland and, via xf86-input-libinput, in X.org.

### Description

An attacker may be able to run malicious code by exploiting a format string vulnerability. Please review the CVE identifier referenced below for details.

### Impact

When a device is detected by libinput, libinput logs several messages through log handlers set up by the callers. These log handlers usually eventually result in a printf call. Logging happens with the privileges of the caller, in the case of Xorg this may be root.
The device name ends up as part of the format string and a kernel device with printf-style format string placeholders in the device name can enable an attacker to run malicious code. An exploit is possible through any device where the attacker controls the device name, e.g. /dev/uinput or Bluetooth devices.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libinput users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/libinput-1.20.1"

```

Title: Format string vulnerability in libinput

```
Component: libinput, affecting all Wayland compositors and X.Org when
using xf86-input-libinput
```

Report URL: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libinput/libinput/-/issues/752>
Reporter: Albin Eldstål-Ahrens and Lukas Lamster
CVSS: 7.1 AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C
Disclosure date: Embargo cancelled due to an independent public bug filed

```
When a device is detected by libinput, libinput logs several messages
through log handlers set up by the callers. These log handlers usually
eventually result in a printf call. Logging happens with the privileges
of the caller, in the case of Xorg this may be root.
```

```
The device name ends up as part of the format string and a kernel device
with printf-style format string placeholders in the device name can
enable an attacker to run malicious code. An exploit is possible through
any device where the attacker controls the device name, e.g. /dev/uinput
or Bluetooth devices.
```

All versions of libinput since 1.10 (released Feb 2018) are affected.

The upstream patch is available as commit
  2a8b8fde90d63d48ce09ddae44142674bbca1c28

libinput releases that include these patches are:
- 1.20.1
- 1.19.4
- 1.18.2
Releases of versions 1.17.x and earlier are not planned at this stage.

```
Many thanks to Albin Eldstål-Ahrens and Benjamin Svensson from Assured
AB for their discovery and responsible reporting of this issue.

This issue was independently discovered by Lukas Lamster. Many thanks
