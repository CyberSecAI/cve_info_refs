- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hot Linked Image Cacher WordPress plugin lacks CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not validate the origin of requests to its image caching functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use CSRF to force a logged-in administrator to cache images from external domains on the server. This could lead to legal risks (due to copyright violations or licensing rules).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable plugin's caching functionality on the victim's website. If a logged-in administrator visits this page, their browser will automatically submit the request without the user's knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage or trigger the form in another way, as well as know the proper URL and parameters to submit to the vulnerable endpoint.
