  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "source": "github.com_a51db5bf_20250115_092744.html",
      "root_cause": "The application's `openExternal` function was not properly validating URLs before opening them in the shell, leading to potential security risks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper URL validation",
        "Inadequate sanitization of URLs"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject malicious URLs into the application, which when opened, could lead to arbitrary code execution or other unwanted actions via the shell. Additionally, the `Graph.sanitizeHtml` function uses `DOMPurify.sanitize` but it was configured with an overly permissive `ALLOWED_URI_REGEXP`, allowing a wider range of URI schemes than intended, creating a potential bypass.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious URLs within the application's data or configuration",
        "Manipulated HTML content containing malicious links"
      ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to inject a malicious URL into the application's data, configuration, or HTML content and induce a user to open/click the crafted link. "
