Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1647:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of "Field Labels" within the FormCraft Basic WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically within the "Field Label" field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that executes within the browsers of users who access the form. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking, where the attacker gains unauthorized access to a user's session.
    - Data theft, where sensitive user data can be exfiltrated to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
    - Defacement, where the appearance of the website can be altered, potentially damaging the website owner's reputation.
    - Redirection to malicious websites, where the attacker can lead the user to sites designed to infect the user's computer with malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the "Field Label" input field within the FormCraft Basic plugin's administration panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or other high privilege access to the WordPress site to modify the formâ€™s field labels.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload (JavaScript code) and inject it into the "Field Label".
- The attack is then triggered when the form is accessed by other users or when the form is embedded on a page or post.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of FormCraft Basic prior to 1.2.6.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79.
- The CVSS score is 3.4 (low).
- The vulnerability was discovered by Chiragh Arora.
- The XSS is triggered when accessing the form in the admin panel as well as when the form is embedded on pages/posts.
