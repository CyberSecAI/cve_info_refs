## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# FormCraft Basic < 1.2.6 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape Field Labels, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload into a Field Label and save: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the form again, as well as in pages/posts where the form is embed
