ax25: fix UAF bug in ax25\_send\_control()

```
There are UAF bugs in ax25_send_control(), when we call ax25_release()
to deallocate ax25_dev. The possible race condition is shown below:

      (Thread 1)              |     (Thread 2)
ax25_dev_device_up() //(1)    |
                              | ax25_kill_by_device()
ax25_bind()          //(2)    |
ax25_connect()                | ...
 ax25->state = AX25_STATE_1   |
 ...                          | ax25_dev_device_down() //(3)

      (Thread 3)
ax25_release()                |
 ax25_dev_put()  //(4) FREE   |
 case AX25_STATE_1:           |
  ax25_send_control()         |
   alloc_skb()       //USE    |

The refcount of ax25_dev increases in position (1) and (2), and
decreases in position (3) and (4). The ax25_dev will be freed
before dereference sites in ax25_send_control().

The following is part of the report:

[  102.297448] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in ax25_send_control+0x33/0x210

This patch defers the free operation of ax25_dev and net_device after
all corresponding dereference sites in ax25_release() to avoid UAF.

ax25: Fix refcount leaks caused by ax25\_cb\_del()

The previous commit [d01ffb9](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d01ffb9eee4af165d83b08dd73ebdf9fe94a519b) ("ax25: add refcount in ax25_dev to
avoid UAF bugs") and commit [feef318](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/feef318c855a361a1eccd880f33e88c460eb63b4) ("ax25: fix UAF bugs of
net_device caused by rebinding operation") increase the refcounts of
ax25_dev and net_device in ax25_bind() and decrease the matching refcounts
in ax25_kill_by_device() in order to prevent UAF bugs, but there are
reference count leaks.

The root cause of refcount leaks is shown below:

     (Thread 1)                      |      (Thread 2)
ax25_bind()                          |
 ...                                 |
 ax25_addr_ax25dev()                 |
  ax25_dev_hold()   //(1)            |
  ...                                |
 dev_hold_track()   //(2)            |
 ...                                 | ax25_destroy_socket()
                                     |  ax25_cb_del()
                                     |   ...
                                     |   hlist_del_init() //(3)
                                     |
                                     |
     (Thread 3)                      |
ax25_kill_by_device()                |
 ...                                 |
 ax25_for_each(s, &ax25_list) {      |
  if (s->ax25_dev == ax25_dev) //(4) |
   ...                               |

Firstly, we use ax25_bind() to increase the refcount of ax25_dev in
position (1) and increase the refcount of net_device in position (2).
Then, we use ax25_cb_del() invoked by ax25_destroy_socket() to delete
ax25_cb in hlist in position (3) before calling ax25_kill_by_device().
Finally, the decrements of refcounts in ax25_kill_by_device() will not
be executed, because no s->ax25_dev equals to ax25_dev in position (4).

This patch adds decrements of refcounts in ax25_release() and use
lock_sock() to do synchronization. If refcounts decrease in ax25_release(),
the decrements of refcounts in ax25_kill_by_device() will not be
executed and vice versa.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernel’s Amateur Radio AX.25
protocol functionality in the way a user connects with the protocol. This
flaw allows a local user to crash the system.

## From the Ubuntu Security Team

Duoming Zhou discovered race conditions in the AX.25 amateur radio protocol
implementation in the Linux kernel during device detach operations. A local
attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash).

ax25: add refcount in ax25\_dev to avoid UAF bugs

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/d01ffb9eee4af165d83b08dd73ebdf9fe94a519b)

```
If we dereference ax25_dev after we call kfree(ax25_dev) in
ax25_dev_device_down(), it will lead to concurrency UAF bugs.
There are eight syscall functions suffer from UAF bugs, include
ax25_bind(), ax25_release(), ax25_connect(), ax25_ioctl(),
ax25_getname(), ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_getsockopt() and
ax25_info_show().

One of the concurrency UAF can be shown as below:

  (USE)                       |    (FREE)
                              |  ax25_device_event
                              |    ax25_dev_device_down
ax25_bind                     |    ...
  ...                         |      kfree(ax25_dev)
  ax25_fillin_cb()            |    ...
    ax25_fillin_cb_from_dev() |
  ...                         |

The root cause of UAF bugs is that kfree(ax25_dev) in
ax25_dev_device_down() is not protected by any locks.
When ax25_dev, which there are still pointers point to,
is released, the concurrency UAF bug will happen.

This patch introduces refcount into ax25_dev in order to
guarantee that there are no pointers point to it when ax25_dev
is released.

ax25: fix UAF bugs of net\_device caused by rebinding operation

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/feef318c855a361a1eccd880f33e88c460eb63b4)

```
The ax25_kill_by_device() will set s->ax25_dev = NULL and
call ax25_disconnect() to change states of ax25_cb and
sock, if we call ax25_bind() before ax25_kill_by_device().

However, if we call ax25_bind() again between the window of
ax25_kill_by_device() and ax25_dev_device_down(), the values
and states changed by ax25_kill_by_device() will be reassigned.

Finally, ax25_dev_device_down() will deallocate net_device.
If we dereference net_device in syscall functions such as
ax25_release(), ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_getsockopt(), ax25_getname()
and ax25_info_show(), a UAF bug will occur.

One of the possible race conditions is shown below:

      (USE)                   |      (FREE)
ax25_bind()                   |
                              |  ax25_kill_by_device()
ax25_bind()                   |
ax25_connect()                |    ...
                              |  ax25_dev_device_down()
                              |    ...
                              |    dev_put_track(dev, ...) //FREE
ax25_release()                |    ...
  ax25_send_control()         |
    alloc_skb()      //USE    |

the corresponding fail log is shown below:
===============================================================

  ...

In order to fix these UAF bugs caused by rebinding operation,
this patch adds dev_hold_track() into ax25_bind() and
corresponding dev_put_track() into ax25_kill_by_device().

The previous commit [d01ffb9](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d01ffb9eee4af165d83b08dd73ebdf9fe94a519b) ("ax25: add refcount in ax25_dev
to avoid UAF bugs") introduces refcount into ax25_dev, but there
are reference leak paths in ax25_ctl_ioctl(), ax25_fwd_ioctl(),
ax25_rt_add(), ax25_rt_del() and ax25_rt_opt().

This patch uses ax25_dev_put() and adjusts the position of
ax25_addr_ax25dev() to fix reference cout leaks of ax25_dev.

Fixes: [d01ffb9](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d01ffb9eee4af165d83b08dd73ebdf9fe94a519b) ("ax25: add refcount in ax25_dev to avoid UAF bugs")

Subject: CVE-2022-1204: Linux kernel: UAF caused by binding operation when
 ax25 device is detaching

Hello there,

There are use-after-free vulnerabilities in net/ax25/af_ax25.c of linux that allow
attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device from user space.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Details  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

The resources such as ax25_dev and net_device will be freed in ax25_dev_device_down(),
if we call ax25_bind() between ax25_kill_by_device() and kfree() in ax25_dev_device_down(),
we could use ax25_dev in functions such as ax25_bind() ax25_release(), ax25_connect(),
ax25_ioctl(), ax25_getname(), ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_getsockopt() and ax25_info_show() after
ax25_dev has been deallocated, and use net_device in functions such as ax25_release(),
ax25_sendmsg(), ax25_getsockopt(), ax25_getname() and ax25_info_show() after net_device
has been deallocated.

One of the concurrency UAF related with ax25_dev in ax25_bind() can be shown as below:

       (USE)                  |     (FREE)
                              |  ax25_device_event
                              |    ax25_dev_device_down
ax25_bind                     |    ...
  ...                         |      kfree(ax25_dev)
  ax25_fillin_cb()            |    ...
    ax25_fillin_cb_from_dev() |
  ...                         |

One of the concurrency UAF related with net_device in ax25_release() can be shown as below:

          (USE)                   |      (FREE)
                                  |  ax25_kill_by_device()
    ax25_bind()                   |
    ax25_connect()                |    ...
                                  |  ax25_dev_device_down()
                                  |    ...
                                  |    dev_put_track(dev, ...) //FREE
    ax25_release()                |    ...
      ax25_send_control()         |
        alloc_skb()      //USE    |

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Effects  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can successfully trigger the vulnerabilities to crash the linux kernel.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Reproduce  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We could use pseudoterminal-based device emulation to simulate
ax25 device from user space and create a socket for it. Then,
we create four threads: the first thread is used to initialize
and start ax25 device, the second thread is used to close the
pseudoterminal-based device, the third thread is used to execute
bind and connect syscalls, the last thread is used to close the
socket. Let these four threads to interleave, we could reproduce
the bug.
