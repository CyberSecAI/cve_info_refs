The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1577.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Database Backup for WordPress" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating schedule backup settings.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The plugin doesn't implement proper checks to verify if the schedule update request is initiated by the user within their session.
  
**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can modify the plugin's schedule settings without the user's consent. 
- This can lead to:
    - Changing the backup notification email address to one controlled by the attacker, which allows them to receive sensitive information contained in the backups.
    - Disabling the automatic backup schedule, preventing future backups.

**Attack vectors:**
- CSRF attack: By crafting a malicious HTML form, the attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into submitting an unauthorized request when they visit a malicious site or a link sent by the attacker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page (social engineering).
- The attacker does not require any other privileges or access to the WordPress system.
