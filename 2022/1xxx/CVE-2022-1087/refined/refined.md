Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Htmly CMS does not properly filter user-supplied content in the "edit profile" module. Specifically, the title field within the edit profile section is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application via the vulnerable title field. This code is then stored and executed when other users view the profile, potentially leading to:
    -  Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies and gaining unauthorized access.
    -  Data theft: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive user data.
    -  Malware distribution: Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    -  Defacement: Modifying the appearance and functionality of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The attacker needs to access the "edit profile" module within the Htmly CMS.
-  The attack vector is a crafted payload, such as a `<script>` tag containing malicious JavaScript code, injected into the title field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Htmly CMS with access to the "edit profile" module.
-  The attacker needs the ability to modify their profile details, including the title field.
