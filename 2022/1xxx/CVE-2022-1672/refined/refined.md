- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSRF vulnerability (CWE-352).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions such as deleting custom URLs.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious link or embedding an iframe on a website, an attacker can force a logged-in administrator to send a request to the vulnerable plugin.
