- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Site Offline plugin fails to properly block access to a website when specific keywords are present in the URL's query string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Access bypass. The plugin's primary function is to restrict website access, but this functionality can be circumvented by adding certain keywords to the URL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass the site offline functionality, potentially accessing content or features that are supposed to be restricted.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a URL that includes specific keywords within the query string (e.g., `?admin`), an attacker can bypass the plugin's restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs the ability to craft URLs and access the affected website.
