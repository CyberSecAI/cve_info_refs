## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YOP Poll < 6.4.3 - IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible to bypass IP-based limitations to vote in certain situations.

### Proof of Concept

When voting, set the X-Forwarded-For header to an IP address different than your legitimate one.

### Affects Plugins
