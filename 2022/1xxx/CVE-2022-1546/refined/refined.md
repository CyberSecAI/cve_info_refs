  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the imported data before outputting it back in the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious CSV file with XSS payloads and uploading it via the plugin's import functionality.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to upload a CSV file through the vulnerable plugin's import interface. An administrator account is required to access the import functionality."
