- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not perform CSRF checks on POST requests to its admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in admin into adding, modifying, or deleting banners from the plugin by submitting a crafted form.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when submitted by a logged-in administrator, sends a POST request to the vulnerable plugin's admin page. The victim must be logged into the WordPress admin panel for the attack to succeed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the malicious form (e.g. via a link in an email, or a malicious website).
