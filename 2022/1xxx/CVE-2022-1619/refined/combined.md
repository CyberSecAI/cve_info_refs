encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[NetApp Volume Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NVE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NVE is, or what encryption algorithm it uses, this is the
resource for you!

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager
for use with ONTAP 9.

##### FPolicy

#### Compliance

Compliance continues to evolve and shape the manner in which we address the
organizationâs of today and more importantly how we address securing the data.
Remember Security does not equal Compliance, but security does in fact aid in
addressing the challenge.

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties. These audits validate the adherence of our products and services to the requirements of such standards as ISO/IEC 27001, the GDPR, and the Common Criteria. These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.
