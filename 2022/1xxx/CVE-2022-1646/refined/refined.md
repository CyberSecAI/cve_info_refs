- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** High-privilege users (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts that will be stored and executed when other users access the affected areas, potentially leading to actions performed in the context of the victim's session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings (e.g. "Consumer Key").
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an admin-level account or any high privileged user within the WordPress application.
