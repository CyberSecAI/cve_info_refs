- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the firewall function of the device's web management portal. Specifically, the `index.cgi` binary uses the `strcpy` function to copy an attacker-controlled "Address" value to a fixed-size buffer without proper length validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) due to the use of `strcpy` without bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overflow the process stack and potentially achieve remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an overly long "Address" value to the web management portal after authenticating with valid credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web portal and be able to send crafted requests. The attack can be performed remotely with low complexity but requires valid credentials (low privilege).
