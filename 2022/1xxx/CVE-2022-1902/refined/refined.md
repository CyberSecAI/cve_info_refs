Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1902:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of notifier secrets within the GraphQL API of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) for Kubernetes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** Notifier secrets were not properly sanitized before being exposed through the GraphQL API. This allowed sensitive information to be retrieved in plaintext.
- **Lack of Proper Access Control:** Authenticated users, even with potentially limited privileges, were able to access and retrieve these secrets, violating the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By obtaining notifier secrets, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges within the system or gain access to external systems configured with these notifiers.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and tokens, could be exposed, potentially leading to further unauthorized access and control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GraphQL API Access:** The primary attack vector involves querying the GraphQL API. An authenticated user with access to the API can craft a query to retrieve the unsanitized notifier secrets.
- **REST API Access (as a supplementary finding):** While the primary vulnerability is in GraphQL, the pull request discussion mentions that the REST API was also not scrubbing data correctly before the fix. This shows that the problem was across multiple access points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to the RHACS GraphQL API.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the RHACS instance to send requests to the GraphQL API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by moving the logic for scrubbing notifiers to the datastore layer, ensuring that secrets are sanitized before being exposed through APIs. This change was implemented in pull request #1803 in the `stackrox/stackrox` repository, which was merged on May 31, 2022.
- The fix was included in the following Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSAs): RHSA-2022:5132, RHSA-2022:5188, and RHSA-2022:5189, which were released on June 20, 24, and 27, 2022 respectively.
- The vulnerability is specifically associated with the `stackrox` product.
