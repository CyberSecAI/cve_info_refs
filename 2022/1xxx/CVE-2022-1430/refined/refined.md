Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `redirect` URL parameter within the login functionality of OctoPrint.  Specifically, the application was not properly checking the provided URL against a whitelist of allowed schemes and network locations. This allowed a malicious actor to inject arbitrary URLs through this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect.  The application accepted a user-provided URL in the `redirect` parameter and, after a login, redirected the user to this specified URL. The lack of proper validation meant this URL could point to an arbitrary external location controlled by an attacker.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Though not explicitly stated, the commit message indicates a secondary XSS issue is also fixed. Given the context of a redirect vulnerability and how the URL is used, it's likely an attacker could craft a malicious URL with a `javascript:` scheme to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker could leverage the open redirect to craft phishing attacks, redirecting users to a fake login page that is made to look identical to the real site, stealing their credentials and other personal info.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could redirect users to a website that serves malware.
- **XSS:** An attacker could execute arbitrary Javascript in the context of the vulnerable application, potentially stealing cookies and session data or performing actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `redirect` parameter in the login URL.
- An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing a crafted `redirect` query parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into clicking on the crafted malicious link containing the malicious redirect. This could be done through social engineering or by embedding the link in other applications or websites.
- No special access to the application is required to exploit this. The attacker would be considered an external entity.
