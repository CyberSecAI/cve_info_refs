Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue present in the `Dpkg::Source::Archive` module of the `dpkg` package when extracting source packages with a `debian.tar` archive. This occurs specifically when performing an in-place extraction of v2 and v3 source package formats.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The core weakness lies in how `dpkg` handles symlinks within tar archives during in-place extractions. `GNU tar` (used by dpkg) follows symlinks when the symlink target is not a directory within the archive itself.
- An attacker can craft a malicious source package with an `orig.tar` containing a symlink pointing outside the intended source tree.
- The corresponding `debian.tar` then includes a file entry that, when extracted, would follow the symlink from `orig.tar` and write outside the intended source tree.
- This directory traversal vulnerability allows writing files and overwriting existing data outside of the source package's extraction path.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to create symlinks and files to read sensitive information from the system.
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can overwrite or modify existing files and directories on the system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a malicious source package using the v2 or v3 format with a specially crafted `orig.tar` and `debian.tar` archive.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the extraction process using the `Dpkg::Source::Archive` module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious source package to a system using `dpkg`.
- The attacker needs to control the contents of the source package, particularly the `orig.tar` and `debian.tar` files.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Max Justicz.
- The fix involves using a temporary directory for extraction even when an in-place extract is requested, preventing the traversal by checking symlink targets before moving files to the destination.
- The fix avoids using a pure perl implementation, `Archive::Tar`, due to compatibility/performance concerns.
- The fix is present in `dpkg` versions 1.21.8, 1.20.10, 1.19.8, and 1.18.26 and later.
- NetApp has also acknowledged the vulnerability affecting one of its products, the "ONTAP Select Deploy administration utility".
