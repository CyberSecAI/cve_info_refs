```
There are race conditions that may lead to UAF bugs in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we call
ax25_release() to deallocate ax25_dev.

One of the UAF bugs caused by ax25_release() is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_dev_device_up() //(1)          |
...                                 | ax25_kill_by_device()
ax25_bind()          //(2)          |
ax25_connect()                      | ...
 ax25_std_establish_data_link()     |
  ax25_start_t1timer()              | ax25_dev_device_down() //(3)
   mod_timer(&ax25->t1timer,..)     |
                                    | ax25_release()
   (wait a time)                    |  ...
                                    |  ax25_dev_put(ax25_dev) //(4)FREE
   ax25_t1timer_expiry()            |
    ax25->ax25_dev->values[..] //USE|  ...
     ...                            |

We increase the refcount of ax25_dev in position (1) and (2), and
decrease the refcount of ax25_dev in position (3) and (4).
The ax25_dev will be freed in position (4) and be used in
ax25_t1timer_expiry().

The fail log is shown below:

This patch adds del_timer_sync() in ax25_release(), which could ensure
that all timers stop before we deallocate ax25_dev.

Subject: CVE-2022-1205 kernel: Null pointer dereference and use-after-free
 in net/ax25/ax25_timer.c

Hello there,

There are NPD and use-after-free vulnerabilities in net/ax25/ax25_timer.c
of linux that allow attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device
from user space.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Details  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

There are race conditions that may lead to null pointer dereferences in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we use
ax25_kill_by_device() to detach the ax25 device.

One of the race conditions that cause null pointer dereferences can be
shown as below:

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_connect()                      |
 ax25_std_establish_data_link()     |
  ax25_start_t1timer()              |
   mod_timer(&ax25->t1timer,..)     |
                                    | ax25_kill_by_device()
   (wait a time)                    |  ...
                                    |  s->ax25_dev = NULL; //(1)
   ax25_t1timer_expiry()            |
    ax25->ax25_dev->values[..] //(2)|  ...
     ...                            |

We set null to ax25_cb->ax25_dev in position (1) and dereference
the null pointer in position (2).

There are also race conditions that may lead to UAF bugs in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we call
ax25_release() to deallocate ax25_dev.

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_dev_device_up() //(1)          |
...                                 | ax25_kill_by_device()
ax25_bind()          //(2)          |
ax25_connect()                      | ...
 ax25_std_establish_data_link()     |
  ax25_start_t1timer()              | ax25_dev_device_down() //(3)
   mod_timer(&ax25->t1timer,..)     |
                                    | ax25_release()
   (wait a time)                    |  ...
                                    |  ax25_dev_put(ax25_dev) //(4)FREE
   ax25_t1timer_expiry()            |
    ax25->ax25_dev->values[..] //USE|  ...
     ...                            |

We increase the refcount of ax25_dev in position (1) and (2), and
decrease the refcount of ax25_dev in position (3) and (4).
The ax25_dev will be freed in position (4) and be used in
ax25_t1timer_expiry().

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Effects  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can successfully trigger the NPD and UAF vulnerabilities to crash the linux kernel.

ax25: Fix UAF bugs in ax25 timers

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/82e31755e55fbcea6a9dfaae5fe4860ade17cbc0)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
There are race conditions that may lead to UAF bugs in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we call
ax25_release() to deallocate ax25_dev.

One of the UAF bugs caused by ax25_release() is shown below:

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_dev_device_up() //(1)          |
...                                 | ax25_kill_by_device()
ax25_bind()          //(2)          |

We increase the refcount of ax25_dev in position (1) and (2), and
decrease the refcount of ax25_dev in position (3) and (4).
The ax25_dev will be freed in position (4) and be used in
ax25_t1timer_expiry().

This patch adds del_timer_sync() in ax25_release(), which could ensure
that all timers stop before we deallocate ax25_dev.

Subject: CVE-2022-1205 kernel: Null pointer dereference and use-after-free
 in net/ax25/ax25_timer.c

Hello there,

There are NPD and use-after-free vulnerabilities in net/ax25/ax25_timer.c
of linux that allow attacker to crash linux kernel by simulating ax25 device
from user space.

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Details  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

There are race conditions that may lead to null pointer dereferences in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we use
ax25_kill_by_device() to detach the ax25 device.

One of the race conditions that cause null pointer dereferences can be
shown as below:

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_connect()                      |
 ax25_std_establish_data_link()     |
  ax25_start_t1timer()              |
   mod_timer(&ax25->t1timer,..)     |
                                    | ax25_kill_by_device()
   (wait a time)                    |  ...
                                    |  s->ax25_dev = NULL; //(1)
   ax25_t1timer_expiry()            |
    ax25->ax25_dev->values[..] //(2)|  ...
     ...                            |

We set null to ax25_cb->ax25_dev in position (1) and dereference
the null pointer in position (2).

There are also race conditions that may lead to UAF bugs in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we call
ax25_release() to deallocate ax25_dev.

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_dev_device_up() //(1)          |
...                                 | ax25_kill_by_device()
ax25_bind()          //(2)          |
ax25_connect()                      | ...
 ax25_std_establish_data_link()     |
  ax25_start_t1timer()              | ax25_dev_device_down() //(3)
   mod_timer(&ax25->t1timer,..)     |
                                    | ax25_release()
   (wait a time)                    |  ...
                                    |  ax25_dev_put(ax25_dev) //(4)FREE
   ax25_t1timer_expiry()            |
    ax25->ax25_dev->values[..] //USE|  ...
     ...                            |

We increase the refcount of ax25_dev in position (1) and (2), and
decrease the refcount of ax25_dev in position (3) and (4).
The ax25_dev will be freed in position (4) and be used in
ax25_t1timer_expiry().

=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=  Bug Effects  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=

We can successfully trigger the NPD and UAF vulnerabilities to crash the linux kernel.

ax25: Fix NULL pointer dereferences in ax25 timers

The previous commit [7ec02f5](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/7ec02f5ac8a5be5a3f20611731243dc5e1d9ba10) ("ax25: fix NPD bug in ax25_disconnect")
move ax25_disconnect into lock_sock() in order to prevent NPD bugs. But
there are race conditions that may lead to null pointer dereferences in
ax25_heartbeat_expiry(), ax25_t1timer_expiry(), ax25_t2timer_expiry(),
ax25_t3timer_expiry() and ax25_idletimer_expiry(), when we use
ax25_kill_by_device() to detach the ax25 device.

One of the race conditions that cause null pointer dereferences can be
shown as below:

      (Thread 1)                    |      (Thread 2)
ax25_connect()                      |
 ax25_std_establish_data_link()     |
  ax25_start_t1timer()              |
   mod_timer(&ax25->t1timer,..)     |
                                    | ax25_kill_by_device()
   (wait a time)                    |  ...
                                    |  s->ax25_dev = NULL; //(1)
   ax25_t1timer_expiry()            |
    ax25->ax25_dev->values[..] //(2)|  ...
     ...                            |

We set null to ax25_cb->ax25_dev in position (1) and dereference
the null pointer in position (2).

The corresponding fail log is shown below:
===============================================================
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000050
CPU: 1 PID: 0 Comm: swapper/1 Not tainted 5.17.0-rc6-00794-g45690b7d0
RIP: 0010:ax25_t1timer_expiry+0x12/0x40
...
Call Trace:
 call_timer_fn+0x21/0x120

 __do_softirq+0xef/0x2f3
 irq_exit_rcu+0xb6/0x100
 sysvec_apic_timer_interrupt+0xa2/0xd0
...

This patch moves ax25_disconnect() before s->ax25_dev = NULL
and uses del_timer_sync() to delete timers in ax25_disconnect().
If ax25_disconnect() is called by ax25_kill_by_device() or
ax25->ax25_dev is NULL, the reason in ax25_disconnect() will be
equal to ENETUNREACH, it will wait all timers to stop before we
set null to s->ax25_dev in ax25_kill_by_device().
