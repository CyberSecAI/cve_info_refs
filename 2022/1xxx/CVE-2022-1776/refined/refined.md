- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Icegram plugin does not sanitize and escape some campaign parameters. Specifically, the `form_header` and `form_footer` fields within the message_data array were vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when viewing or previewing the campaign, potentially leading to actions like session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with Contributor role (or higher) can create or edit a campaign and insert the malicious payload into the vulnerable fields within the form settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have at least a Contributor role within the WordPress site.
