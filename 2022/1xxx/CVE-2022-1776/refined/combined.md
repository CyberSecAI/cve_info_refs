## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Icegram < 2.1.8 - Contributor+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape some campaign parameters, which could allow users with a role as low as contributor to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a campaign (such as a Black Friday one), check the "Use Opt-in / Subscription / Lead capture form" settings and put the following payload in the "message\_data[6130][form\_header]" and "message\_data[6130][form\_footer]" fields: <img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered when viewing/previewing the campaign

### Affects Plugins
