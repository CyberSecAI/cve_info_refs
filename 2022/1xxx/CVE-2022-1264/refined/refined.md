Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as Path Traversal. This occurs during the processing of uploaded ZIP files in the Inductive Automation Ignition software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate the path information contained within uploaded ZIP files, allowing an attacker to potentially specify locations outside of the intended upload directory.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server by uploading a maliciously crafted ZIP file.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable via the web configuration interface of the Ignition software, requiring network access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges to access the web configuration interface of Ignition software. The attack complexity is considered low.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all 8.0 versions after 8.0.4 and all 8.1 versions prior to 8.1.10 of Inductive Automation Ignition software.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-22 (Path Traversal).
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 6.8 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N
*   No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
