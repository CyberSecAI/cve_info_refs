- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some parameters before outputting them back into HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via HTTP GET requests to the `popup.php` file of the plugin with malicious payloads in the `id` and `class` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They only need to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into accessing it.
