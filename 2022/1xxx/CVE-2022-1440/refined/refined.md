{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `git clone` command is constructed within the `clone` function of the `Git` class. Specifically, the `--depth` option was not properly positioned in the command string.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
      "Improper Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands via the `repository` or `dest` parameters by leveraging the incorrect placement of the `--depth` option, causing arbitrary command execution on the system running the vulnerable code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious Git repository URL",
      "Malicious destination path"
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control or manipulate the `repository` or `dest` parameters passed to the vulnerable `clone` function."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "fix_details": "The fix involves reordering the `git clone` command so that the `--depth` option is placed before the repository and destination parameters, thereby preventing injection.",
    "code_diff": "The vulnerability was resolved by changing `return this.gitExec(`clone ${repository} ${dest}${depthOption}`);` to `return this.gitExec(`clone ${depthOption} -- ${repository} ${dest}`);`"
