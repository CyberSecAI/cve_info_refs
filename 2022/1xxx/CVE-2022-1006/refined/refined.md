Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-1006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `id` parameter in the "Advanced Booking Calendar" WordPress plugin when editing calendars. Specifically, the `$_POST["id"]` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the database query, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper sanitization and escaping of user-provided input (`$_POST["id"]`) before using it in a database query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify, add, or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or unauthorized changes to the website.
- **Loss of Control:** In severe cases, an attacker might gain complete control over the database and potentially the server if the SQL user has sufficient privileges.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** While not the main impact, it is also possible to cause DoS by manipulating SQL queries to consume excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `admin-post.php` endpoint with a malicious `id` parameter via the `abc_booking_editCalendar` action. Specifically, the vulnerable code is in `/backend/seasons-calendars.php`, where the `id` parameter is used.
- **Admin Panel Interaction:** The vulnerability is present within the plugin's admin panel when editing calendars.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin Access:** The attacker needs administrative access to the WordPress dashboard to exploit this vulnerability (high privilege user such as admin).
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter (id) and the vulnerable plugin action `abc_booking_editCalendar`
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests with the malicious payload to the affected endpoint.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content also includes a patch in the form of a code change, specifically the fix is to apply `intval()` to `$_POST["id"]` before using it in SQL queries.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.8.
- The vulnerability is listed under CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
- The fix was implemented in version 1.7.1 of the plugin, before which the plugin is vulnerable.
