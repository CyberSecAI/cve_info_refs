- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A high-privileged user, such as an admin, can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser of other users when they interact with the affected part of the application. This could lead to various malicious activities including, but not limited to, session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites. The impact of this vulnerability is considered low.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker, with admin privileges, injects the malicious payload into the CSS settings of a slider. The XSS will be triggered when editing the slider again.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin or other high-privileged access to the WordPress site to create or edit sliders.
