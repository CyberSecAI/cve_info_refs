- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Forms by Pie Forms" does not properly sanitize and escape certain form fields.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into form fields. This code will be executed when the form is displayed on the front end, potentially leading to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, redirection, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or editing a form and inserting a malicious payload into the "Form Name", "Form Description", or "Successful form submission message" fields, and also enabling "Enable Form Title / Name on Front End" and "Enable Form Description Front End" options.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as admin, within the WordPress environment to create or edit forms.
