The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1904.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Easy Pricing Tables plugin does not properly sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back into a page. This occurs when a specific setting ("Compatibility Mode") is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of sanitization/escaping of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page. This malicious code can then be executed within the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload. The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits the specially crafted URL while having the "Compatibility Mode" setting enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to visit it.
The user has to have the compatibility mode setting enabled in order for the exploit to work.
