Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1688:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the `id` parameter within the Note Press WordPress plugin before it's used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, caused by directly incorporating user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- Lack of input validation: The plugin fails to validate and sanitize the `id` parameter before using it in SQL statements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can manipulate the SQL queries to potentially:
    - Access sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the server.
- The provided proof of concept shows that the attacker can use SQL injection to execute arbitrary SQL commands, including sleep commands which is indicative of blind SQL injection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the WordPress admin dashboard via the `id` parameter within the Note Press plugin's admin pages.
- Specific vulnerable pages include:
    - `admin.php?page=Note_Press-Main-Menu&action=view`
    - `admin.php?page=Note_Press-Main-Menu&action=edit`
    - `admin.php?page=Note_Press-Main-Menu&action=delete`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrator privileges to access the vulnerable admin pages. This is indicated by the CVSS vector string having PR:H (Privileges Required: High).
