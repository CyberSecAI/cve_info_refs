- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability leading to arbitrary settings update and Stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the plugin settings. By injecting malicious JavaScript into the settings (specifically the 'read more' field), the attacker can achieve stored XSS.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form and tricks a logged-in administrator into submitting it. This form targets the plugin's settings update page and injects malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into submitting the crafted form. They do not need any privileged access on the target system.
