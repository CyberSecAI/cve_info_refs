## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Newsletter < 7.4.6 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not escape and sanitise the preheader\_text setting, which could allow high privilege users to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks when the unfilteredhtml is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Go to Newsletters of Newsletter at wordpress admin panel ( eg . https://wordpress.local/wp-admin/admin.php?page=newsletter\_emails\_index ).
Create the "new newsletter", and then choose any type of templates ( default presets ) except from Raw HTML.
Input the simple test XSS payload at the Snippet Input
Payload : Test Snippet<script>alert(0)</script>
And Click the "Save" and "Next". The Stored XSS payload will execute.
