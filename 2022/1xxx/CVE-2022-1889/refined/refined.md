- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape and sanitize the `preheader_text` setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, and redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a high-privileged user (Admin+) by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `preheader_text` setting of a newsletter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have admin level privileges to access the Newsletter settings page and save the malicious payload.
