{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a potential null pointer dereference in the `gf_dump_vrml_simple_field` function within the `src/scene_manager/scene_dump.c` file of the GPAC project. Specifically, when handling `GF_SG_VRML_SFNODE` type fields, the code was accessing `*(GF_Node **)field.far_ptr` without ensuring that `field.far_ptr` itself is not NULL. This dereferences a pointer, even if null, which can cause a crash. Additionally, an assertion `assert(*(GF_Node **)field.far_ptr);` was present, but this is disabled in release builds.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of exploitation is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability. If `field.far_ptr` is NULL, dereferencing the pointer will cause a crash, terminating the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves processing a crafted VRML file that contains a `GF_SG_VRML_SFNODE` field where `field.far_ptr` is set to NULL.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to supply a maliciously crafted VRML file to the vulnerable GPAC application."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The commit identified fixes this vulnerability by checking if the `field.far_ptr` is NULL before dereferencing it. This change introduces a check to handle the case when far_ptr is null and passes null to `gf_dump_vrml_node` function to prevent the crash"
