- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via its shortcode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious activities on the database.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitable via a crafted shortcode, which can be executed through an AJAX action by any authenticated user (Subscriber+).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user (Subscriber+). They must be able to send a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with a specific action and a malicious shortcode.
