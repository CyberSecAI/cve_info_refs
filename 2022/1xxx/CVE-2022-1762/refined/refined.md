- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly validate the origin IP address by checking HTTP headers, specifically `CF-CONNECTING-IP`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: IP address spoofing vulnerability which leads to protection bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can bypass the plugin's country blocking feature.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted HTTP request with a spoofed `CF-CONNECTING-IP` header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be located anywhere and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected website.
