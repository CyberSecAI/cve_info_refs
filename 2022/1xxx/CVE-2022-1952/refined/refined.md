The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1952.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the eaSYNC WordPress plugin. Specifically, an AJAX action accessible to unauthenticated users does not properly validate uploaded files. Although a list of allowed file extensions exists, it is not used during the validation process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- Insufficient input validation.
- Failure to enforce the allowlist of valid file extensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP files, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the affected server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, utilizing the `easync_session_store` action.
- The attacker uses the `driver_license_image2` field to upload the malicious PHP file.
- Subsequently, the attacker can access the uploaded file via a URL obtained through a `easync_success_and_save` action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs network access to the WordPress instance.
- The attacker needs to know the endpoint and parameters required for the malicious upload.
