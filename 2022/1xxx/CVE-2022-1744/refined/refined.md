- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Applications on the ImageCast X system can execute code with elevated privileges by exploiting a system-level service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Execution with unnecessary privileges (CWE-250). A system-level service is vulnerable to exploitation allowing applications to gain elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges on a device and/or install malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires access to the system to leverage the system-level service vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires physical access to the ImageCast X device.
