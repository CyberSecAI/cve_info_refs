- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when disabling its protection mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF check.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into disabling the plugin's protection, potentially making private files publicly accessible and deleting the `.htaccess` file.
- **Attack vectors**: CSRF attack, where a malicious actor crafts a form that, when submitted by an authenticated administrator, disables the pluginâ€™s protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to submit a specially crafted form. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
