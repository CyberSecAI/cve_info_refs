Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-1403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the affected product (Delta Electronics ASDA-Soft) not properly sanitizing input while processing a specific project file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):** The lack of input sanitization leads to a condition where the software can write data outside of the intended memory boundaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of the out-of-bounds write vulnerability can lead to **arbitrary code execution**. This implies that an attacker could potentially run malicious code on the affected system, leading to a wide range of impacts, including system compromise, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves processing a specially crafted project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to provide a malicious project file to the vulnerable software.
*   The attacker requires local access to the system (AV:L).
*   User interaction is required to open/process the malicious project file (UI:R).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects ASDA-Soft version 5.4.1.0 and prior.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.8, with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   The affected product is used in the Critical Manufacturing sector and is deployed worldwide.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor (Delta Electronics) has released an updated version (v5.5.0.0 and later) that addresses the vulnerability. Users are advised to update their software.
*   Additional mitigations include minimizing network exposure for control system devices, isolating them behind firewalls, using secure remote access methods (VPNs), and being cautious with untrusted project files.
