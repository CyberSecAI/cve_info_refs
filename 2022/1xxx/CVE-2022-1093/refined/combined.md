## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Meta SEO < 4.4.7 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting via breadcrumbs

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape the breadcrumb separator before outputting it to the page, allowing a high privilege user such as an administrator to inject arbitrary javascript into the page even when unfiltered html is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

As admin, put the following payload in the Breadcrumb separator setting and save: <script>alert(/hello/)</script>
The XSS will be triggered in page/post where Breadcrumb is enabled
