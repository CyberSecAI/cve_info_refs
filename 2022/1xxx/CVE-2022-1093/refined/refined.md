Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The WP Meta SEO plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape the breadcrumb separator before displaying it on the page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization/output escaping.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, leading to potential execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser, which can result in various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to be an admin or a user with high privileges to modify the breadcrumb separator setting. The payload is stored in the database and executed when a page with breadcrumbs is loaded.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or high-privilege access to the WordPress dashboard of the vulnerable website.

The vulnerability is located in the `WP Meta SEO` WordPress plugin, specifically in the handling of the breadcrumb separator setting. It allows for stored XSS because the separator is not sanitized before being output to the page. The provided proof of concept clearly demonstrates how an admin user can inject a javascript payload. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 and the CVSS score is 2.7 (low).
