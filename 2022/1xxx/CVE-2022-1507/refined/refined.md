Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2022-1507:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A crafted GIF file with no frame data can cause a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference vulnerability in the `gif_internal_decode_frame` function within the `libnsgif` library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (crash) due to the null pointer dereference.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted GIF file with no frame data to the chafa application, which uses the vulnerable `libnsgif` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted GIF file as input to the chafa application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `libnsgif/libnsgif.c`. The fix involves checking if `gif->frames` is NULL before attempting to access it. This prevents a crash if the GIF file lacks frame data.
- The vulnerability was reported by @JieyongMa via huntr.dev.
- Patches have been applied in Fedora 34, 35, and 36.
