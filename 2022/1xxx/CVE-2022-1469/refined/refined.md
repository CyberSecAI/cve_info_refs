- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The FiboSearch plugin fails to sanitize and escape certain settings, specifically the "No results label" and "More results label" fields under Woocommerce > FiboSearch > Autocomplete > Products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The lack of input sanitization allows malicious JavaScript code to be saved within the plugin settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they interact with the affected functionality of the plugin. This could lead to actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the plugin's settings page, specifically by modifying the "No results label" or "More results label" fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or other high-privilege role) to access the plugin's settings page. The attacker does not need the `unfiltered_html` capability to perform the attack.
