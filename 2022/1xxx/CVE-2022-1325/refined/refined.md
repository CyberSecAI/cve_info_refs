{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The CImg library's `load_bmp()` and `load_pandore()` functions did not properly validate the dimensions specified in the image file headers against the file size. This allowed an attacker to provide a crafted image file with modified dimensions that would cause the library to allocate a huge buffer, leading to a denial of service due to RAM exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to RAM exhaustion. A maliciously crafted image file can force an application using the CImg library to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to a crash or system instability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted BMP or Pandore image files"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted image file to an application using the vulnerable CImg library. This could be achieved via user-uploaded content, downloaded files, or other means of file input."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "initial_fix": "The initial fix (commit `619cb58dd90b4e03ac68286c70ed98acbefd1c90`) added checks to ensure that the calculated buffer size based on the image dimensions does not exceed the file size. However, this check was bypassed when reading a virtual file buffer (`FILE*`) due to `cimg::type<ulongT>::max()` returning a very large number.",
     "final_fix": "The final fix (pull request `#348` and commit `5801be3d268c93e724b1395019463d86e660e04b`) addresses the bypass by introducing `cimg_max_buf_size` and implementing a check within the `safe_size` function, ensuring that the calculated size is within user-specified limits, thus preventing large memory allocations. `cimg_max_file_size` has been renamed to `cimg_max_buf_size`."
