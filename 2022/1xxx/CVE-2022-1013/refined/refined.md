- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied POST data before it is used in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration or modification. This specific exploit uses a `SLEEP` command to verify the vulnerability, indicating the possibility of more serious attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX request (`admin-ajax.php`) with the `ays_pd_ajax` action and the `ays_pd_game_find_word` function. The `groupsIds[]` parameter is used to inject malicious SQL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to send a crafted HTTP POST request.
