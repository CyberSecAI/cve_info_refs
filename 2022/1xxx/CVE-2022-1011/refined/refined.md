{
  "CVE-2022-1011": {
    "description": "Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the FUSE (Filesystem in User-Space) implementation. A local user permitted to mount FUSE filesystems could exploit this to cause a use-after-free and read sensitive information.",
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability occurs due to a flaw in how FUSE handles write() operations in direct I/O mode, specifically when a user-space filesystem reuses the buffer after the kernel has unlocked the request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with the ability to mount FUSE filesystems can exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive data such as partial /etc/shadow hashes from the FUSE filesystem and achieve privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A local user permitted to mount FUSE filesystems. They need to trigger a write operation using a fuse filesystem, which is set up to use the normal kernel page cache for read/write operations. The attacker needs to manipulate the timing such that the FUSE request is marked as complete after being unlocked, while the write buffer is still in use by the userspace filesystem, causing a UAF condition."
