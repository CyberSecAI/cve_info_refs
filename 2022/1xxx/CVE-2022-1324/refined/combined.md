## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Event Timeline <= 1.1.6 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitize and escape Timeline Text, which could allow high-privileged users such as admin to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a Timeline, put the following payload in the "Text" field at the bottom: <script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
Click save (below the Text field, not the button on top of the page), then click Update
The XSS will be triggered in post/page where the Timeline is embed
