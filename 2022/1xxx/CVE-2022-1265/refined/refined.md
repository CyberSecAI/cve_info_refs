- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its CAPTCHA settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious scripts into the CAPTCHA error message field. This script will be executed when a user attempts to log in with incorrect CAPTCHA input, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves manipulating the "Login Form: CAPTCHA Error message" field within the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the WordPress site. They must also be able to access and modify the plugin settings. The XSS is triggered by a user attempting to log in with an incorrect CAPTCHA.
