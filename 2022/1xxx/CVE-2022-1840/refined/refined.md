{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not filter the content correctly at the \"register\" module, leading to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application that will be executed when other users view the affected page. This could lead to a variety of attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uses the 'register' module by submitting a crafted request to store the malicious script, which is later executed when a user views the user list page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the application and the ability to edit a register page. Specifically, an attacker could log in to the admin account using default credentials, access the register page, insert the payload, and publish. When other users visit the user list, the payload is executed."
