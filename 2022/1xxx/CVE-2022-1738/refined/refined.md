Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1738:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read in the Fuji Electric D300win software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125):** This allows an attacker to access memory locations outside the intended buffer, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Leakage:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the process memory due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Manipulation of information:**  This is stated as a general impact of exploitation of *these* vulnerabilities but is not specific to the out-of-bounds read but to the *write-what-where condition* vulnerability also described

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based (Remote Exploitation):** The advisory states this vulnerability is exploitable remotely with low attack complexity

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system.
- **Low attack complexity:** The advisory explicitly states low attack complexity

**Additional Details:**

- The affected software is D300win, a programming support tool expert from Fuji Electric.
- Affected versions are prior to 3.7.1.17.
- The advisory mentions a CVSS v3 base score of 8.7 with a vector string of AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N for CVE-2022-1738.
- Another vulnerability is mentioned (CVE-2022-1523, write-what-where), but this is not related to the target CVE
- The advisory recommends minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and using secure remote access methods (VPNs) as mitigations.
- The advisory mentions that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
