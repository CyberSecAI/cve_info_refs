The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back via an AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or the redirection of users to malicious sites.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through an AJAX action accessible to both unauthenticated and authenticated users. The vulnerable parameter is the "title" parameter of the "get_sw_product" action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing a JavaScript payload and trick a user into accessing it. No special capabilities or position are required as the AJAX endpoint is publicly accessible.
