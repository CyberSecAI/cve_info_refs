The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1713.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks in the `ProxyServlet.java` file within the drawio project. Specifically, the `checkUrlParameter` method, intended to validate URLs, had redundant checks and allowed bypassing the intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Redundant checks:** The code had multiple redundant checks for the same conditions using both `host` and `hostAddress`, which made the code harder to maintain and allowed inconsistencies.
- **Bypass of intended restrictions**: Due to the redundant checks, it was possible to craft URLs that bypassed the intended host restrictions, which were in place to prevent access to internal or restricted networks. The commit fixes the issues by removing the redundant checks on the host string and only checks the host address.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially use the proxy functionality to access internal resources or services that should not be publicly accessible, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious actor can craft a URL with a specific hostname that bypasses the filtering logic and then use it to make the proxy access a restricted resource.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide a URL as an input to the proxy servlet. This implies the attacker needs to be able to interact with or control the part of the application that uses this proxy functionality.
