The provided content relates to a commit that addresses a SQL injection vulnerability in the `forkcms` project.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by not sanitizing the `ids` array before using it in a SQL query within the `getComments` function. The original code directly used the values from the `$ids` array, which could potentially be manipulated by an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from using unsanitized user-supplied input directly in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially manipulate the SQL query to perform unauthorized database operations, such as reading sensitive information, modifying data, or even deleting database tables.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the `ids` array before it is passed to the `getComments` function. This could be done if the `ids` array is derived from a user-controlled source (e.g. URL parameters, POST requests).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to control or manipulate the input that is used to form the `ids` array which is passed to `getComments` function, typically through user input or API interaction.

**Details from the diff:**
- The commit changes the following line:
`'WHERE i.id IN (' . implode(', ', array_fill(0, count($ids), '?')) . ')', $ids`
to
`WHERE i.id IN (' . implode(', ', array_fill(0, count($ids), '?')) . ')', array_map('intval', $ids)`
- The `array_map('intval', $ids)` part is the fix. This sanitizes the array by converting all the values in `$ids` to integers before passing them to the SQL query, preventing SQL injection.
