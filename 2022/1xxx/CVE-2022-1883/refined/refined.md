Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of string formatting (`fmt.Sprintf`) to construct SQL queries, instead of using parameterized queries. Specifically, user-provided input from the `tf_version` and `lineage_value` query parameters are directly embedded into the SQL query string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `tf_version` or `lineage_value` parameters, an attacker could inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to several serious consequences, including:

*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** Malicious alteration or deletion of data.
*   **Denial of Service:** Injecting queries that consume excessive database resources.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Potentially, gaining higher privileges on the database server depending on the database setup and permissions of the application user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the `/search` endpoint of the application, which takes URL query parameters.
*   Specifically, the `tf_version` and `lineage_value` URL parameters are vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/search` endpoint.
*   The attacker requires an understanding of SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads for the vulnerable query parameters.

 	}

```

The original code used `fmt.Sprintf` to directly inject user input into the SQL query. The fix replaces this with a parameterized query approach, using `?` placeholders and a separate `params` slice. This ensures that user input is treated as data, and not as SQL code, preventing SQL injection.

The commit message "fix(db): possible sql injection on /search endpoint" clearly indicates that this commit is addressing a SQL injection vulnerability.
