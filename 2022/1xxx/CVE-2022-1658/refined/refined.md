Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-1658:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient access control in the Jupiter Theme's plugin management functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Plugin Deletion:** The `abb_remove_plugin` AJAX action within the `framework/admin/control-panel/logic/plugin-management.php` file allows any authenticated user to delete any installed plugin.
*   **Missing Access Control:** The AJAX action lacks proper access control checks, allowing low-privileged users, such as subscribers, to perform administrative actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reduced Site Security:** Deleting essential plugins can severely compromise site security and functionality.
*   **Damage to Functionality:** Removal of plugins can break essential features and user experience, leading to service disruption.
*   **Potential Data Loss:** Depending on the plugins deleted, the attacker may cause data loss or corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted AJAX request.
*   **Authenticated:** The attacker must be a logged-in user, even with the lowest privilege (e.g., subscriber role).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the affected WordPress site.
*   The attacker must be able to send AJAX requests to the server.

**Summary**

CVE-2022-1658 allows any authenticated user, including subscribers, to delete any plugin on a WordPress site running a vulnerable version of the Jupiter Theme. This is due to the lack of access control on the `abb_remove_plugin` AJAX action, enabling attackers to disrupt site functionality and security by deleting arbitrary plugins.
