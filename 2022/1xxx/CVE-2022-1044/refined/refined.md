Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of sanitization of EXIF data within image files uploaded as user profile pictures. Specifically, the `src/controllers/accounts.js` file handles image uploads, and the commit `097b4823935c4fa524e71ab2dd107cf2056922b0` introduces code to remove this EXIF data. The vulnerability is that, prior to this commit, the EXIF data was not removed, potentially allowing an attacker to embed malicious code in the image metadata.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of EXIF Data Stripping:** The system was vulnerable to embedded malicious code within the EXIF metadata of uploaded image files, specifically profile pictures. This is because the EXIF data was not being removed, allowing malicious scripts/data to persist in the image file.
- **Image Upload Vulnerability:** The `accountsController.uploadImage` function was vulnerable due to it not sanitizing or stripping EXIF data from image uploads, creating a potential attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potential for Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could embed malicious scripts within the EXIF data of an image, which, if not properly handled when the image is loaded, could potentially lead to script execution in the context of the user's browser or server. This could lead to various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or other malicious activities, depending on the context of how the EXIF data is handled.
- **Information Leakage:** EXIF data can contain sensitive information, such as GPS coordinates, camera settings, and other metadata, which could be extracted by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Image Upload:** An attacker could create a specially crafted image file with malicious code embedded in its EXIF data, then upload it as their profile picture.
- **Profile Picture Manipulation:** Exploiting the user profile picture upload feature is a direct attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Registered User:** The attacker needs to be a registered user of the application with the ability to upload profile pictures.
- **Image Manipulation:** The attacker requires the ability to modify or create image files to inject malicious data into the EXIF metadata.
- **Knowledge of Target System:** To maximize the impact of the attack, the attacker should understand how the target system handles and renders images, which is how the malicious data could be executed.

**Mitigation:**
The commit `097b4823935c4fa524e71ab2dd107cf2056922b0` addresses the vulnerability by adding a function `stripExifData` within `/src/helpers/utils/index.js` which removes the EXIF data. The `accountsController.uploadImage` function calls this function after saving the image to the disk.
