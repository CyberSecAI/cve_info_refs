The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Autolinks" WordPress plugin, version 1.0.1 and earlier, which is related to CVE-2022-1112.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings. It also fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** Absence of CSRF checks allows an attacker to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in admin into submitting it.
*   **Stored XSS:** Input fields for Image Title and Alt prefixes are not sanitized or escaped, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin's settings.
*   When a logged-in admin views the settings, the injected script will execute in their browser.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirection to malicious websites, or other unauthorized actions within the WordPress admin panel.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form containing the payload.
*   The attacker uses social engineering to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the form, potentially through a link or website.
*   The form is submitted to the vulnerable plugin's settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious form.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into submitting the form.
