- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-controlled settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. When these settings are displayed to other users within the application, the script executes in their browsers, potentially allowing an attacker to perform malicious actions on the users' behalf, such as session hijacking, phishing, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative or other high-privilege access to the plugin settings.
