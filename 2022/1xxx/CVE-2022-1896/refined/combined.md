## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# underConstruction < 1.21 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise or escape the "Display a custom page using your own HTML" setting before outputting it, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiletred\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

In the plugin's settings, active Under Contraction feature, select "Display a custom page using your own HTML" then put the following payload in the "Under Construction Page HTML" field: <svg onload=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered in the homepage (when viewed as non admin)
