{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free (UAF) issue that occurs when the `r_anal_extract_vars` function uses `op->src/dst` after the `regprofile` has been invalidated, leading to dangling pointers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free (UAF)",
      "Dangling pointers",
      "Incorrect handling of register profile invalidation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to crashes and potential arbitrary code execution if exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting specific input that triggers the vulnerable code path within the radare2 analysis engine during arm/thumb switching, causing a crash due to UAF.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide input that causes the vulnerable code path in `fcn_recurse` and `r_anal_extract_vars` to be executed during arm/thumb switching."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The fix provided is not fully safe. The developers mentioned that a complete fix requires breaking ABI compatibility and adding reference counting to `RRegItem`, which cannot be done in the current version (5.6.x) due to compatibility rules. The issue was reported by @peacock-doris via huntr.dev. A reproducer test case `tests_65185` also exists."
