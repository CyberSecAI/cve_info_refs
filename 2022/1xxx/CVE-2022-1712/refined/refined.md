- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The LiveSync for WordPress plugin does not implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, allowing arbitrary settings updates.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can make a logged-in administrator change plugin settings, including potentially the hostname, temporary directory, database, username, and password. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the connected database and environment.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTML form that is submitted via a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into submitting the malicious form. No other special privileges are required beyond that of a logged in admin.
