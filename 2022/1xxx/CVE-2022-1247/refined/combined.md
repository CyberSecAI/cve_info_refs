| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2066799#c0)  Rohit Keshri    2022-03-22 14:06:33 UTC  ``` We have found a race condition bug in rose_connect(). The rose driver uses rose_neigh->use to represent how many objects are using the rose_neigh. When a user wants to delete a rose_route via rose_ioctl(), the rose driver calls rose_del_node() and removes neighbours only if their "count" and "use" are zero:  ''' static int rose_del_node(struct rose_route_struct *rose_route, struct net_device *dev) { ... spin_lock_bh(&rose_node_list_lock); spin_lock_bh(&rose_neigh_list_lock); ... if (rose_neigh->count == 0 && rose_neigh->use == 0) [1] rose_remove_neigh(rose_neigh); [2] ... out: spin_unlock_bh(&rose_neigh_list_lock); spin_unlock_bh(&rose_node_list_lock); ... } '''  As the code shows above, modifications on a rose_neigh should be protected by rose_neigh_list_lock. However, rose_neigh->use is changed without any locks in rose_connect():  ''' static int rose_connect(struct socket *sock, struct sockaddr *uaddr, int addr_len, int flags) { ... rose->neighbour = rose_get_neigh(&addr->srose_addr, &cause, &diagnostic, 0); [3] ... rose->neighbour->use++; [4] ... } '''  So if a user creates two threads, t1 and t2, and execute functions in the following order: t1[3] - t2[1] - t2[2] - t3[4] The rose socket will keep the pointer of the neighbour while the neighbour is freed, and thus lead to an uaf.  I wrote a PoC and tested it on Linux-5.17-rc5, the result shows as below:  ''' / $ /home/pwn/poc > /dev/null [ 44.546300] ================================================================== [ 44.547030] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in rose_connect+0x11f5/0x1420 [rose] [ 44.548981] Read of size 2 at addr ffff88800de27b2a by task exp/305 [ 44.549048] [ 44.549048] CPU: 7 PID: 305 Comm: exp Tainted: G E 5.17.0-rc5 #1 [ 44.549048] Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.10.2-1ubuntu1 04/01/2014 [ 44.549048] Call Trace: [ 44.549048] <TASK> [ 44.549048] dump_stack_lvl+0x4c/0x63 [ 44.549048] print_address_description.constprop.0+0x24/0x150 [ 44.549048] ?
