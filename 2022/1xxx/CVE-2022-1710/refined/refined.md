The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1710.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Appointment Hour Booking WordPress plugin fails to sanitize and escape settings of its Calendar fields. This allows for stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input in the "Additional CSS Class" setting of calendar fields.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the website that will execute when a user views a page where the calendar is embedded or when an administrator edits the calendar settings. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement of the website.
    - Stealing sensitive information.
    - Other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when:
    - A user views the calendar embedded on a post or page.
    - An administrator accesses the field settings when editing the calendar.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site to be able to edit the calendar fields. This is classified as a high privileged user.
- The user has to have the ability to create and modify calendar fields and insert the malicious payload into the "Additional CSS Class" setting.
