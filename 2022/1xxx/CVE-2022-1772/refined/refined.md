- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape the Google API key setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious administrator could inject malicious scripts that execute when a super-administrator views the plugin settings page, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious administrator inputs a crafted payload in the "Google Places API Key" setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator access to the WordPress site. In a multisite configuration, a malicious administrator can target a super-administrator.
