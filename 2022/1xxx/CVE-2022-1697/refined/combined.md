# Okta Active Directory Agent CVE-2022-1697 - Sep 1, 2022

[View all security advisories](/security-advisories)
### Description

Okta Active Directory Agent versions 3.8.0 through 3.11.0 installed the Okta AD Agent Update Service using an unquoted path.

### Affected product and versions

Okta customers that have currently installed or previously had installed versions 3.8.0, 3.9.0, 3.10.0, and 3.11.0 of Okta Active Directory Agent.

### Resolution

The vulnerability is resolved in Okta Active Directory Agent version 3.12.0.  The Okta AD Agent Update Service is not capable of deploying all security enhancements that are introduced in version 3.12.0. To remediate this vulnerability, you must uninstall Okta Active Directory Agent and reinstall Okta Active Directory Agent 3.12.0 or greater per the documentation.

#### Severity details

To exploit this issue, a local attacker would need to have Administrator and local access to the Active Directory hosts where this agent is installed. The attacker would then need to determine if the vulnerable configuration exists and the unquoted path. Administrator privileges would be required to introduce malicious software into the unquoted path.

# Okta + Privacy

We believe privacy is an important topic for everyone and is especially critical when it comes to protecting the most sensitive information available today: your identity.

## Okta customers own their data

Our business is built on secure, safe connections between people and technology – not monetizing customer data. We do not sell customer data – any and all data uploaded into the Okta service by or on behalf of a customer – and we never will.

![Data]()

![Okta Security]()

## Okta is built for security and privacy

Every product at Okta is designed with privacy and security at the forefront. Okta leverages a Zero Trust approach to access, which focuses on ensuring users have access to only the information and services they need to do their work at the right time, and no more. Okta also uses a multi-layer encryption architecture to protect data at rest and over the wire, including users' access to Okta and their applications, how the tenant data and encryption keys are segregated and managed, and how access to all infrastructure is managed and monitored.

---

## Okta enables building with privacy

We aim to enable “privacy-by-design” for anyone building software with identity. Strong privacy should be built into every customer experience, and Okta strives to help developers build robust identity protections and security best practices into their software.

![Privacy Graphic]()

## Okta improves customer experiences without compromising privacy

When we use data to improve the Okta service or provide better experiences for our customers, we do so while protecting our customers’ data and maintaining users’ privacy, and we are committed to being transparent about that use. For example, today we use aggregated and anonymized metadata about customers’ use of the Okta service to provide the Okta service and industry insights back to our customers in two ways:

### Businesses @ Work

# Update the Okta Active Directory agent

Run an installation program for a newer version of an Okta Active Directory (AD) agent to update your current version. The installer doesn't overwrite any existing configuration data in the Okta AD agent folder.

You can also update agents automatically. See [Automatically update Okta Active Directory agents](agent-auto-update-main.htm).

If you have installed multiple Okta AD agents, make sure that they're all the same version. Running different versions within a domain can cause all agents in that domain to function at the level of the oldest agent. This doesn't affect other domains.

To continue using an Okta AD agent and avoid downtime, you must have a minimum of two agents running before you upgrade one of them. See [Install multiple Okta Active Directory agents](ad-agent-install-multiple.htm) . It's a best practice to update one or two agents simultaneously to avoid taking all agents offline at the same time. Upgrade your Okta Preview environment first to confirm that everything is working correctly before you upgrade your production environment.

1. In the Admin Console, go to SettingsDownloads.
2. Scroll to the AD Agent Installer section and click Download Latest.
3. Run the installation program and follow its directions.

Cause Analysis\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for any impact this incident has caused you, your business or your customers. At Okta trust and transparency are our top priorities. Outlined below are the facts regarding this incident. We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact\r\n\r\nOn November 9, 2021 at 12:09 pm (PST), Okta monitoring began receiving alerts of failed Workflows execution requests on US Cells 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 11 impacting Workflows services. At the same time, Okta began receiving reports from customers who were impacted in the following scenarios:\r\nWorkflows Console - Unavailable from 12:45 pm - 3:50 pm\r\nWorkflow API calls experienced timeouts from 12:55 pm - 2:25 pm. Some API calls began to succeed at 2:25 pm until full recovery at 3:50 pm\r\nEvent Hooks processing was delayed by cell per the following time windows\r\n\r\nUS Cell 1: 1:50 PM PST - 3:20 PM PST\r\n\r\nUS Cell 2: 1:05 PM PST - 4:47 PM PST\r\n\r\nUS Cell 3: 1:28 PM PST - 4:15 PM PST\r\n\r\nUS Cell 4: 1:15 PM PST - 3:25 PM PST\r\n\r\nUS Cell 6: 1:10 PM PST - 6:00 PM PST\r\n\r\nUS Cell 7: 1:00 PM PST - 4:20 PM PST\r\n\r\nUS Cell 11: limited impact\r\n\r\nWorkflows scheduled flows were not impacted. \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nOkta determined that the root cause was a maintenance update which required a restart of some Workflows platform services. The restart, combined with system load on these services, impacted the orchestration between the services which in turn incorrectly caused healthy worker servers to be marked as unhealthy. This caused these worker servers to be taken out of service, which propagated the impact and caused unavailability of Workflows Console and Event Hook processors.\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nOkta took action to identify the affected platform services, and restarted these services to restore them to health adding additional capacity to aid in faster recovery. At 3:02 pm PST, the services started to recover and normal operation was restored at 3:50 pm PST. Event Hooks that had been triggered during the impact window were queued and continued redelivery to get current through 6:00 pm PST (see catchup time windows per cell above).\r\n\r\nPreventive Actions\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the impact to Workflows for similar future events, Okta will implement configuration and process improvements for these types of maintenance updates. Okta is also implementing additional monitoring and alerting to further reduce the time needed for issue identification and resolution.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000AqaVeEAJ"},"Id":"a1P4z00000AqaVeEAJ","CreatedDate":"2022-11-16T00:02:04.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000Yzi5EAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"An issue impacting Microsoft O365 Federated Single Sign-On for all end users in all cells has been identified and is being investigated.

Upon investigation, Okta found that customers in all cells would experience errors if attempting to add child AWS accounts or modify existing AWS integration configurations.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent further issues to customer configurations, Okta immediately made all AWS app instance configurations read-only. This change was rolled out to all cells by 1:41pm PST until the root cause of the authentication issues could be identified and resolved.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation determined that the errors were the result of a recent upgrade to the AWS SDK which conflicted with Okta's existing logic for resolving STS endpoints. In the majority of configurations, Okta's logic would previously default to the Global STS endpoint, however after the upgrade the same resolution process began always returning the lexicographically first endpoint, which was the STS endpoint for the Asia Pacific region (Hong Kong). Because the Version 1 STS tokens that Okta generates are only valid in regions which are enabled by default, and Asia Pacific is not enabled by default, Okta's subsequent AssumeRole calls to that region were failing.\r\n\r\nThough the SDK upgrade was tested in some environments, the affected configuration workflow had not been incorporated into any automated or manual end-to-end testing flows; this service interruption highlighted a gap in our regression test plan within the AWS application integration.\r\nOnce Okta determined the cause of the errors, a fix was implemented to route all STS calls to the global endpoint. This fix was deployed to US Cell 1 at 8:49pm PST and then to all cells. By February 28 at 9:01pm PST, the update was completed and service was fully restored.\r\n\r\nOkta is currently working to update how endpoints and regions are passed to the AWS SDK to increase efficiency and reduce latency.

Customers attempting to use the ASA client or the dashboard, as well as all server agents attempting to enroll or sync data, saw failed requests.\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, it was determined that the root cause was a migration to new AWS Auto Scaling Groups (ASG). During this migration both the old ASGs and the new ASGs were active, which had the effect of doubling the maximum number of connections which could be opened to the primary application database cluster. An unexpected significant spike in API traffic mid-migration pushed the number of connections to this maximum. The database cluster was not configured to support this number of connections, causing the database cluster to become unresponsive.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 3:10PM (PT) Okta engineers reverted the migration, directing all traffic to the original ASGs, and began downsizing the new ASGs to reduce the number of open connections. Engineers simultaneously triggered a failover to the secondary DB cluster and restarted the primary DB cluster. Unfortunately, the ASGs had still not fully downsized, and all ASG instances connected to the secondary DB cluster caused similar issues on the secondary DB cluster. At this point, engineers disabled serving agent API requests in an attempt to reduce load. Engineers then manually forced termination of the remaining nodes in the ASGs, and restarted both DB clusters. At 3:39PM (PT) Okta validated that server login flows were being serviced normally. After establishing that the service was stable, Okta engineers re-enabled the serving of agent API requests, fully restoring all service functionality at 3:46PM (PT).\r\n\r\nOkta has implemented additional monitoring of ASA’s database performance for early detection, and engineers are in the process of reviewing and tuning ASA’s database connection limits. Additionally, Okta plans to implement a connection-pooling proxy in front of the primary ASA database cluster to prevent future occurrences of this issue.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P1Y000009QRDLUA4"},"Id":"a1P1Y000009QRDLUA4","CreatedDate":"2020-11-25T20:12:41.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C1Y0000008PepUAE","UpdateLog\_\_c":"We have identified the root cause and are investigating mitigations to address the root cause.

As a result, a secondary cache node in a different availability zone was automatically promoted to primary. Manual analysis of slot and node health indicated that all nodes in the cluster were healthy but that cluster resiliency was degraded as a result of the fail-over.\r\n\r\nIn order to regain cluster resiliency, a fail-back command to revert to the original primary/secondary node relationship was manually issued at 1:39am PST. This fail-back attempt completed. However, immediately thereafter all requests to the specific hash range served by this node either timed out if the primary was contacted directly or errored out if the request hit another node of the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe combination of timeouts, retries, and new requests resulted in customers in US Cell 4 experiencing increased latency and intermittent 429 (rate limit) or 502 (server resource unavailable) error responses.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation determined the original network outage and corresponding secondary node promotion was due to a local hardware issue on the cache cluster primary node from the underlying cloud network service provider. Cluster health checks performed prior to fail-back did not capture this underlying hardware instability, which was on-going. Due to this oversight, the fail-back command resulted in a primary node assignment within an unstable environment.

Customer requests attempting write operations at this time would have failed or resulted in 503 errors. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the incident is Okta’s cloud service provider experienced an underlying hardware failure incident which resulted in errors and read only mode in US Cell 2. The service behaved as designed for this failure case and went into read-only mode. \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nUpon receiving alerts, Okta immediately began diagnosing the issue. After confirming the details of the incident and impact with Okta’s cloud service provider we executed a database failover per our standard procedure. At 1:39PM PT the cell returned to fully operational mode. \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions\r\n\r\nOkta is working with the cloud server provider to investigate additional mitigations and improve response to these types of incidents.\r\n\r\nDuration (# of minutes): 11","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000B1xV4EAJ"},"Id":"a1P4z00000B1xV4EAJ","CreatedDate":"2021-05-15T14:22:57.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000oLm1EAE","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Root Cause Analysis:\r\nOn May 13, 2021 at 10:43AM PDT Okta began receiving alerts for an abnormally high volume of network traffic on US Cell 6. Shortly thereafter, Okta began receiving reports regarding service availability impact from customers in US Cell 6. At 10:50AM Okta’s infrastructure provider began to automatically limit the volume of traffic to US Cell 6 to mitigate impact to downstream services. This limitation dropped a percentage of all network traffic, including some requests from customers. Okta customers using Custom Domains or Mobile scenarios were not affected.\r\n\r\nAt 11:03AM, Okta contacted our infrastructure provider to increase throughput capacity and allow more traffic. Concurrently, Okta added additional HTTP proxies in US Cell 6 and the service returned to normal operation by 11:44AM.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers and are continuously taking steps to improve the Okta service and mitigate the impact of similar future events, including:\r\n\r\nImproving our load balancer configurations to not send traffic to degraded zones\r\n\r\nWorking with our infrastructure provider to set reasonable rate limits and network traffic capacity","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000BAKi7EAH"},"Id":"a1P4z00000BAKi7EAH","CreatedDate":"2021-08-28T07:05:35.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000wk32EAA","UpdateLog\_\_c":"We sincerely apologize for any impact this incident has caused to you and your business and your customers.

We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact\r\n\r\nOn August 25th at approximately 6:03PM (PT) Okta received customer reports that they were receiving SSL certificate warnings on their clients for requests to the Okta service. Investigation revealed that this issue impacted custom URL domain users on US Cell 12. In addition, this issue was observed to occur intermittently during this period with the overall success rate of greater than 75% for users. Overall response time and Admin requests were not impacted during this period.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nOkta determined that the root cause was a maintenance operation to update routers in US Cell 12. During the initial execution of this operation, the custom domain SSL certificates failed to properly load on a router which prevented establishing TLS connections for some custom domains intermittently by displaying a warning to users. The impact was intermittent because requests are handled by a pool of routers, and only requests received by the affected member of the US Cell12 router pool were impacted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nAt 8:10PM, Okta began to address the impact by removing the affected router that did not have the SSL certificates loaded from the router group. Following resumption of normal operation, Okta successfully added a router with correct certificates back into the router group for US Cell12.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventive Actions\r\n\r\nOkta is improving the process for deploying and verifying SSL certificates as well as adding detection measures to prevent occurence of this issue in the future.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000C1eeOEAR"},"Id":"a1P4z00000C1eeOEAR","CreatedDate":"2023-07-19T23:48:56.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000TXHQEA4","UpdateLog\_\_c":"The hotfix deployment started at 2:00 PM PDT and is progressing for the remainder of the cells.

A subset of network traffic received 403 errors. At 10:43am (PT) the issue was rectified. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary: \r\n\r\nDuring a maintenance task to align network rules across infrastructure, a set of rules was inadvertently changed from count mode to block mode. The rulesets affected network connections originating from a known set of gateways that mask source IP addresses. This resulted in some requests being blocked with 403 errors while other requests were unimpacted. Requests to custom domains were unimpacted. In aggregate, there was up to 15% decrease in connection connections to the Okta service. The experience was more impactful for customers who permanently leverage proxy servers to access the Okta service.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nUpon discovery of the overly-restrictive rule, the change to the rule sets was identified and rolled back at 10:36am (PT). By 10:43am (PT) the decrease in connections and the 403 errors subsided. \r\n\r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nOkta is revising runbooks for changing rule sets to enhance detection of unintended changes to decrease the time to reverting changes.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000A0l5qEAB"},"Id":"a1P4z00000A0l5qEAB","CreatedDate":"2024-03-28T16:42:25.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z0000000oGpEAI","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Following is the RCA summary for a recent incident where a third-party provider or downstream service experienced an issue which impacted the Okta service\r\n \r\n\r\nDetection and Impact:\r\n\r\nOn March 20th starting at 8:30AM (PT), Okta became aware of intermittent connection timeout failure issues with Workday on all US Cells.

We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact:\r\nOn October 4th at approximately 9:23AM (PDT) Okta received customer reports that they were receiving Invalid Assertion SAML errors in Amazon Web Services (AWS) when trying to Single Sign On (SSO) using our AWS Account Federation app. The issue was observed to impact orgs with provisioning API enabled but provisioning options - Create Users and Update User Attributes - disabled on all Cells. \r\n \r\nRemediation Steps:\r\nThe reports stemmed from an upgrade to the integration which triggered app meta-data migrations for customers using the app which started on October 4th at approximately 7:50AM (PDT). At 4:53AM (PDT) on October 5th, the root cause was confirmed and Okta conducted a rollback of the app version on all Cells. Rollbacks were completed by 6:05AM (PDT) when the service was fully restored and operated as expected. \r\n \r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\nPrior to the AWS Account Federation app upgrade, a code change had been made to how provisioning options were handled when migrating customers to a new app version. This change resulted in AWS roles not being migrated for customers who had enabled provisioning, but had disabled all provisioning options. This omission of the role meta-data caused SSO into AWS to fail.\r\n \r\nPreventative Actions: \r\nOkta is working on a fix to the application migration process so that the role information will be properly added to the SAML token.

Shortly after, Okta monitoring began to report an increase in error rates. At the same time, Okta began receiving reports from customers who were experiencing timeout errors and they were impacted in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- Workflow API calls did not complete execution and timed out\r\n\r\n- Workflows Console Folder view errors/timeouts were experienced until 11:35AM\r\n\r\n- Workflows Designer Test flow timeout errors were experienced until 12:16PM\r\n \r\nUpon investigation, Okta identified a workflow that was generating a large incoming workload and took immediate action to isolate it. The system load generated by this workload was not automatically distributed across nodes in the cluster as expected. As a result the incoming requests continued to accumulate which degraded overall workflows performance. The cluster eventually became unresponsive. In addition, the health checks between redundant nodes did not report any infrastructure issues. This caused further delays in isolating and remediating the issue.\r\n \r\nOnce Okta isolated the problem to the unresponsive node, we immediately performed a restart of that node at 12:00PM and service was largely restored at approximately 12:20PM PDT and was fully restored at 12:45PM PDT.\r\n \r\nTo mitigate the impact to workflows for similar future events, Okta continues to invest in system automation to gracefully handle large workloads.

This migration operation contained a replication error that caused some customer data in Workflows Tables to not be migrated to the new database. This error was documented in internal log files, but was not highlighted in our validation procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nOkta took action March 3 at 9:50 am to identify and restore customer table data for newly created Okta Workflow Tables. Additionally, Okta continued investigation and made limited corrections when it could be done safely, without overwriting valid data. In conjunction with that, Okta contacted all customers that reported an issue and provided a [knowledge article](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Workflows-Tables-Incident-March-3-2023) with additional steps to review/confirm impact, and resolution actions that they can take to self remediate.

Following the release, Okta received reports from customers encountering sign-in errors in the Preview sandbox environment. \r\n\r\nA small subset of pre-production customers that utilize customized sign-in pages in the US Preview environment with a custom authorization server on Okta Classic experienced repeated page load errors. This only affected the Preview sandbox environment in US Preview Cell OP1 for users that did not already have a live session in progress. No production cells were impacted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary: \r\n\r\nAn update for the Content Security Policy (CSP) header enforcement for non-customizable pages caused a regression in a specific use case in the Preview sandbox environment. Further investigation revealed that the customized sign-in widget for custom domains during an app initiated authorization flow using a custom authorization server impacted the sign-in flow.\r\n\r\nThis resulted in users in the pre-production sandbox environment to experience persistent errors in loading the sign-in page.

Outlined below are the facts regarding this incident.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact: \r\n\r\nOn February 2nd at 9:46am (PT) Okta was alerted to errors and increased response times for the Okta service in the US Preview Cell OP1. At 9:52 am the service began to recover. Subsequently at 10:15 am Okta detected increased errors again in the US Preview Cell and took action to remediate and restore normal service operation at 11:25 am. During these two incident periods our automated response switched application servers into read only mode to continue serving primary use cases. In addition, Okta agents were incorrectly identified as disconnected even though they continued to operate as expected.\r\n\r\n \r\nRoot Cause Summary: \r\n\r\nThe root cause of these errors have been traced to an issue with network storage devices from Okta’s infrastructure provider which did not failover as expected. In addition, Okta Agents were incorrectly marked as disconnected for an extended period of time, due to an issue in Okta’s agent health status tracking; nevertheless, these agents were able to reach and connect to the Okta service. \r\n\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nIn the first occurrence of the incident at 9:46am, as Engineering began to investigate, the service recovered through remediation actions taken by the infrastructure provider itself. When errors started to increase again starting at 10:15am, Okta rerouted incoming traffic to redundant databases to restore normal service operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nOkta is reviewing operational response procedures to enable faster remediation and recovery for these types of failures.

At 12:29pm PDT the impacted services were identified and action was taken across all impacted cells. After intervention, workflow processing services restarted at 12:32pm PDT and all services were fully restored by 12:45pm PDT. Once services were restored, queued background workflows processed as expected and completion rates returned to normal across all cells. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring the duration of the incident, customers within APAC Cell 1 and US Cell 5 would have been unable to access the workflow designer tool and background workflow processes were held in queue for delayed processing. During the impact window US Cells 5 and APAC Cell 1 experienced workflow processing delays; however, all jobs were processed as expected after services were restored. During the incident, Okta also believed US Cell 10 to have been impacted, but after further investigation Okta logs revealed that US Cell 10 had continued to function correctly throughout the incident window.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, Okta identified that a manual input error during a maintenance update within APAC Cell 1 and US Cell 5 had caused workflow processes to scale down. The corresponding reduction in workflow process completion triggered internal monitoring and alerting systems and triggered immediate intervention by Okta. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nAt 12:29pm PDT the impacted services were identified and action was taken to manually scale workflow services back up to expected levels within the impacted cells.

We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDetection and Impact: \r\n\r\nOn October 31st at 5:00 PM (PT), Okta received customer reports that they were experiencing issues that prevented successful multi-factor authentication for some users across all Okta cells when accessing applications using Okta. Users on Okta classic would see repeat requests for multi-factor authentication. For users on Okta Identity Engine (OIE) they would experience a 403 error.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMore details below, however the impact was related to new functionality based on expiration of device token cookies. The maximum impact of this incident was 0.15% of the Okta user base, with only a subset of those users experiencing the issue.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring investigation, it was determined that clearing their browser cache would resolve this issue in almost every case, so impacted customers were advised to do this and a knowledge article was published.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOkta applies device token cookies as part of the sign in logic to determine whether a user requires an additional authentication factor to successfully login. Recently an upgrade was introduced to expire existing device token cookies beginning November 1 gradually over a 28 day period, in order to implement a new cookie type.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was determined after investigation that there is another function within Okta which incorrectly generated the device token cookie again if it expired leading into the flow, and there was insufficient test validation for the operation involving cookie logic to catch this failure. As a result, a new device token cookie was generated and sometimes erroneously immediately expired, which created repeated requests for factor authentication.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nOkta identified a fix and began deploying the solution to all cells starting at 3:35PM (PT) on November 1st. At 9:55 PM, the solution was deployed to all cells in the Okta service.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nOkta is updating our test and monitoring procedures for token replacement changes and actions related to multi-factor authentication, to prevent similar incidents.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000009mRd2EAE"},"Id":"a1P4z000009mRd2EAE","CreatedDate":"2022-11-04T21:15:58.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000YzhlEAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"An issue impacting Okta email delivery for end users in all cells is being mitigated.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000009mRdCEAU"},"Id":"a1P4z000009mRdCEAU","CreatedDate":"2022-11-04T21:41:01.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000YzhlEAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"An issue impacting Okta email delivery for end users in all cells is being mitigated.

Some agents were incorrectly identified as disconnected until 6:27am (PT) even though they worked as expected.

Okta Agents that were unsuccessful connecting during this period were marked as disconnected for an extended period of time incorrectly, due to a bug in Okta’s agent health check service from ~6:08am (PT) to ~6:27am (PT).

Customers experienced very long delivery delays, or in some cases did not receive their one time passcode requests through SMS.\r\n\r\nOkta confirmed with our downstream telecommunications providers that this was a network issue with multiple US carriers.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\nUS carriers experienced network issues across the US for messages sent through a short code, which caused SMS delivery delays and failures for the subscribers of their services.\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\nCustomer Support advised customers with a secondary MFA factor enrolled to utilize that method. Okta engaged with its downstream vendors to address the issue, and as the issue progressed, Okta was notified of, and implemented, a workaround by switching the short code SMS sender ID to a toll free number.\r\n\r\nPreventive Actions:\r\nThe root cause of the issue occurred within the telecommunication infrastructure rather than with one of Okta's downstream telecommunications providers. Okta strongly recommends that customers always configure multiple MFA factors, so that in cases such as this, where the telecommunications infrastructure is impacted, end users are able to authenticate leveraging another factor.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000AqaVyEAJ"},"Id":"a1P4z00000AqaVyEAJ","CreatedDate":"2022-11-16T02:47:11.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000Yzi5EAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Okta has isolated the issue that is impacting the Microsoft O365 Federated Single Sign-On issue.

We are committed to implementing additional improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTiming:\r\n\r\nAt 8:50pm Okta detected the issue. We deployed a correction at 9:09pm. All services were confirmed fully restored by 9:30pm.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDetection and Impact\r\n\r\nOn June 23rd at approximately 8:50PM (PT) during a planned maintenance operation Okta detected intermittent request failures for some customers in US Cell 6. Investigation revealed that some requests to the Okta service resulted in 50X errors or slowness. Further analysis determined that the success rate of requests was highly intermittent during the period with >74% success at some instances in time, and <20% during others.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nImmediately upon determining a resolution path, Okta began to address the impact and restore service availability. At 9:09PM Okta began to put http proxies into rotation to support customer traffic which restored most functionality. By 9:30PM all services were confirmed fully restored.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nOkta Determined that this incident occurred during a planned maintenance operation that updates http proxies in US Cell 6. During the execution of this operation two things contributed to the root cause:\r\n\r\nThe procedure is intended to incrementally update http proxy groups in sequential fashion. During this incident, the grouping of http proxies was skipped which caused more http proxies to be taken out of rotation in US Cell 6 than intended. \r\n\r\nThe automated validation which assures that a sufficient number of http proxies are available and in rotation, was mistakenly disabled during this maintenance operation.\r\n\r\nHad only one of these mistakes occurred, the automated operation would have prevented the http proxy maintenance from even starting in US Cell 6.\r\n\r\nPreventive Actions\r\n\r\nOkta is taking multiple steps to prevent recurrence of this issue:\r\n\r\nImmediately stop the use of the operational procedure that led to the incident\r\n\r\nUpdate the standard operating procedure to ensure additional reviews are conducted\r\n\r\nImprove automation to make the http proxy capacity check mandatory in order to eliminate cell wide impact when the proxy infrastructure requires updates\r\n\r\nIn addition to the steps above, Okta has implemented a general moratorium for US Cell 6, as well as a moratorium on http proxy operations across all cells until the identified preventative measures and automations are fully implemented and verified.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000AqaW3EAJ"},"Id":"a1P4z00000AqaW3EAJ","CreatedDate":"2022-11-16T03:18:35.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000Yzi5EAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Okta has isolated the issue that is impacting the Microsoft O365 Federated Single Sign-On issue.

During this time, customers in these cells who attempted to access flow history were unable to see the requested information.

Okta confirmed with our downstream telecommunications providers that this was a network issue with multiple US carriers which had started at 10:55AM PST and resolved by 12:05PM PST. Okta continued to monitor the situation thereafter. \r\n\r\nIn all US based cells, a small number of customers were intermittently impacted in their SMS MFA requests. These customers experienced very long delivery delays, or in some cases did not receive their one time passcode requests through SMS. However, retry requests were successful. \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nUS carriers experienced network issues across the US for messages sent through a short code, which caused SMS delivery delays and failures for the subscribers of their services.\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nOkta’s failover mechanism picked up failover traffic, preventing an outage. Retries were successfully processed.\r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the issue occurred within the telecommunication infrastructure rather than with one of Okta's downstream telecommunications providers. \r\n\r\nOkta strongly recommends that customers always configure multiple MFA factors, so that in cases such as this, where the telecommunications infrastructure is impacted, end users are able to authenticate leveraging another factor.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000009mRiCEAU"},"Id":"a1P4z000009mRiCEAU","CreatedDate":"2022-11-16T20:28:07.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000Yzi5EAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Okta has provided a self-service guide to help resolve the authentication issues for Office 365 applications.

Evaluation of the support request determined that provisioning operations and password synchronization between the RingCentral Application and the Okta Service was not functioning as expected.\r\n\r\nInvestigation of this issue revealed an unexpected behavior while building the request URL path for most of the API calls in the RingCentral provisioning flow, which caused provisioning operations to fail. Further investigation determined the unexpected behavior was a result of a client library update, which had introduced a breaking change for the provisioning operations flow of the RingCentral application. Users attempting to authenticate into RingCentral via the Okta service were not impacted, however, user administrators attempting to provision or deprovision users within the RingCentral application would have been unable to complete profile updates during this time.\r\n\r\nAt 5:30 PM PST on May 26th Okta reverted to the prior release of the affected service and RingCentral provisioning operations were observed to complete as expected. At 6:45 PM PST the revert had been successfully deployed to all cells and the impacted application was able to synchronize with Okta.\r\n\r\nAs part of Okta’s commitment to integration integrity, a manual audit to proactively identify other applications that could be impacted by similar client library updates was completed alongside a review of automated test cases to ensure similar issues are detected in the future.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000009mRu3EAE"},"Id":"a1P4z000009mRu3EAE","CreatedDate":"2022-12-23T18:58:08.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000Yzj3EAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"We sincerely apologize for any impact this incident may have caused to you, your business, or your customers.

Customers attempting to use the ASA client or the dashboard, as well as all server agents attempting to enroll saw failed requests.\r\n\r\n \r\nAfter investigation, it was determined that the root cause was a planned database migration to enable new functionality in the ASA platform. This migration caused a blockage of application transactions which resulted in timeout errors for user requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we test all new migration scripts before deployment, this issue only occurs when handling large data sets which we did not encounter in our tests.\r\n\r\n \r\nAt approximately 12:20PM (PT) Okta engineers restarted the ASA server enrollment endpoint service, fully restoring all service functionality at 12:28PM (PT). All our enrollment calls have an automatic retry logic and were successful after the service was restored.\r\n\r\n \r\nOkta plans to improve testing of migration scripts to cover scenarios like this, add more safeguards around the execution of migrations and implement more optimized rollout procedures to prevent future occurrences of this issue.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000BAKvBEAX"},"Id":"a1P4z00000BAKvBEAX","CreatedDate":"2022-02-17T18:19:33.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000wkBBEAY","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Microsoft O365 Push Groups are failing since Production Release version 2022.02.1 in all cells are being addressed.

Okta Engineering’s analysis shows that 0.9% of users who installed Okta Verify for Android version 7.9.1 were impacted; this represents 0.01% of users using Okta Verify for Android.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nThe incident's root cause is a regression from a third-party library update included in the Okta Verify 7.9.1 update. Further investigation revealed that the library introduced an incompatibility with specific Android devices, resulting in this failure condition. Only Android devices built using a specific CPU chipset (subgroup of ARM Cortex) were affected.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nAfter confirming the details of the incident and successfully reproducing the error, Okta implemented and verified a successful fix for the issue. This new app version was submitted to the Play Store for approval, and once approved by Google, deployed to the store as Okta Verify 7.9.2. Impacted customers were instructed to upgrade to Okta Verify 7.9.2.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nOkta is updating our app rollout monitoring strategy to detect issues earlier in the release cycle.

Okta confirmed that our primary provider was experiencing issues sending SMS messages to cellular providers which started at approximately 5:45AM PT. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAs a temporary measure, at 7:01AM PT Okta switched the ordering of primary and secondary providers and delivery rates began to improve for all areas except Canada, who experienced intermittent delays. At 10:50AM PT the primary provider had resolved their internal issue and, upon testing and confirmation, the ordering was reset and normal processing resumed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nThe service degradation was a result of our primary provider encountering an internal issue within their data-center which prevented SMS deliveries. As a result of this issue, customers had to manually request a resend which were handled by the secondary provider. \r\nThe delay of SMS traffic to Canada by our secondary provider was due to defensive measures taken on the part of that provider as a result of the unexpected spike in requests. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nOkta mitigated the issue by redirecting the traffic to the failover provider. \r\nCustomer Support advised customers in Canada with an enrolled secondary non-Telephonic MFA factor to use that factor.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions\r\n\r\nOkta strongly recommends that customers always configure a non-Telephonic MFA factor.

We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact:\r\n\r\nOn August 31st at 10:59AM (PT) Okta detected an increased error rate across US Cells 5, 7, 12, 14 and Workflows FL5, 12, 14. At 2:33PM Okta also detected an increased error rate in EU Cell 2.\r\n\r\nDuring the incident, customers may have experienced intermittent errors when attempting to access the service. Success rates for customer requests averaged ~85% and in most cases, a retry operation would succeed. Error rates decreased as Okta implemented mitigation measures, but the overall durations of the incident are as follows:\r\n\r\nUS Cells 5, 7, 12, 14 from 10:59AM to 3:35PM (PDT) \r\n\r\nEU Cell 2 from 2:15PM to 3:30PM (PDT).\r\n\r\nWorkflow cells FL5, FL12 and FL14 Workflows 11:02AM - 12:28PM (PDT) \r\n\r\nPlease note that there were use cases and periods where some customers experienced significantly higher error rates and request latency, for example requests that initiated outbound calls, that are not captured in the all up analysis across all impacted tenants.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nThe root cause of the incident is one of Okta’s cloud service providers experienced network issues in one availability zone in one of their US locations and one availability zone in one of their European locations which caused inbound and outbound connection errors that impacted the Okta service. \r\n\r\nBecause of the intermittent nature of the errors, our service did not automatically take impacted tiers out of service. This meant they continued to accept requests even though they might not be able to successfully execute them instead of leaving them to the unimpacted tiers in the other two availability zones that cells are hosted across.

At 3:15pm (PT) all functionality was restored and normal processing resumed. \r\n\r\n\r\nPreventative Actions\r\n\r\nTo ensure this does not happen again, Okta is including additional latency monitoring and tooling improvement to avoid performance slowdowns. These monitoring changes will improve Workflow’s scalability and enable us to root cause slowdowns swiftly. \r\n\r\nTotal Duration (Minutes): 701","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000C9TQ0EAN"},"Id":"a1P4z00000C9TQ0EAN","CreatedDate":"2024-04-09T01:25:23.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000TXHzEAO","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Infrastructure changes to address growth have completed as of 6:00 P.M PDT.

We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDetection and Impact: \r\n\r\nOn March 26th, at 8:40AM PT, Okta’s monitoring system alerted our team of delays in Workflows Low Latency mode resulting in impacts to Workflows. At this time, all customers in US FL1 who were running flows would have been affected by delays in flow execution. Customers would have intermittently experienced slowdowns and timeout issues on their flows.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nThis issue was a result of the Workflows cell reaching maximum throughput capacity which caused flows to be completed at a slower rate. Two distinct areas were identified as bottlenecks and addressed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nImmediately upon receiving alerts, Okta began diagnosing the issue and launched a series of scaling actions to help with stability. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDuring this time, two bottlenecks were identified. First, a cache cluster had been impacted by increased traffic resulting in elevated CPU usage and network latency. Second, cloud storage operations were affected by a recent application change, which resulted in increased overall usage and reduced system throughput.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAt 2:55PM PT, the team decided to offload specific use cases in the cache cluster to a new cluster. At 9:57PM PT the team cut over to the new cluster and network latency to the cache cluster dropped significantly. Simultaneously, a hotfix was applied to adjust cloud storage operations and system performance significantly improved. At 11:05PM PT normal processing resumed.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nThe fixes applied during this time have resolved this issue and further improved service reliability issues also seen in previous incidents. Additional updates and investments are under review and will be applied appropriately. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Okta has identified a number of opportunities to enhance our monitoring capabilities in these areas.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000A0kqWEAR"},"Id":"a1P4z00000A0kqWEAR","CreatedDate":"2023-10-27T01:27:45.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000TXHVEA4","UpdateLog\_\_c":"The current issue for the Search function for users and groups is persisting.

The policy was too restrictive and resulted in traffic being denied to the affected endpoints causing an outage for the specific OAuth client app. Due to the on-behalf nature of the authentication, customer facing Microsoft OAuth client apps were not present in our internal Microsoft Azure staging environment, therefore this scenario was not caught during testing.\r\n \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nThe change was implemented at 5:32AM PT. Immediately upon receiving the support requests at 8:53AM PT, Okta began to diagnose the problem.

Outlined below are the facts regarding this recent incident that may have disrupted your ability to use some functionality of the Okta service.\r\n\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact: \r\n\r\nOn October 26th at 7:55AM PT, Okta detected errors occurring in US Cell 14. Customers experienced incomplete search results when searching for any of users, groups and devices (“entities”) in the admin pages. The entities created and/or updated between October 26th, 7:55 AM PT and October 27th, 3:30 AM PT were the ones that were impacted and there was a delay in changes to that data showing up in search results. The Rate Limit dashboard had an additional impact. It had a delay in data showing up during the period and was also missing data for a window of a few hours after the functionality was restored. \r\n\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nBased on our investigation and findings, the root cause of these errors is slowness in our data processing pipeline that deals with said entities and the rate limit data. The slowness was compounded by the retries that the data processors attempt when they don’t receive an acknowledgement for prior action in time.\r\n\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nAfter confirming the details of the incident and impact, the issue was fixed by expanding the data processing capacity to process backlogged data quickly, and then reprocessing all the data for the entities that had changed since October 26th 7:55AM PT, the start of the incident.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of October 27th at around 7:59 AM PT, we realized that data from a window of time of around 3 hours starting from 8AM October 26th wasn’t processed correctly.

As we received reports and analyzed them, we were able to determine that the issue applied to impacted customers across all cells who could not log in to their Office 365 applications for the duration of the incident and received an error message when attempting to sign in with a note that the “federated realm object did not exist”.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, with sufficient Support case data points, we were able to conclude that customers who had Microsoft Office 365 and user provisioning enabled on their application integrations were not affected.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nOkta software code changes follow a standard release process, where changes are first deployed to preview cells and a week later slowly rolled out to the production cells. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the standard release process, we have an internal metadata configuration service that allows us to modify third party application integration metadata. This service allows Okta to quickly react to unexpected third party application changes that might break or cause other disruptions to integrations.\r\n\r\nAt 10:37AM, we used our metadata configuration service to remove the deprecated Dynamics 365 application links. The rollout of this configuration change triggered a bug causing authentication failures for customers using O365 and who were configured with domain federation and who were not using provisioning.\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nOnce customers began reporting errors, Okta immediately began an investigation and pursued clearing an application level cache as a solution path. After several attempts of clearing the cache, we concluded that this did not resolve the issue after all. At 4:25PM (PT), Okta rolled back the app configuration in an attempt to restore the system to its prior state. This did not resolve the issue because the configuration had already been changed due to the bug and it further compounded the problem by removing additional objects. \r\n\r\nWhile Okta continued to investigate the issue and seek solutions, it identified the necessary steps for customers to resolve the issue by reconfiguring their federated domains. On November 16 at 12:51AM (PT), Okta published a knowledge article that customers could use to resolve the Microsoft O365 Federation SSO issue.\r\n\r\nOkta continued to pursue alternative ways to restore authentication without requiring customer action, but eventually concluded that reconfiguring customer domains via the knowledge base article was the best path forward.\r\n\r\nImprovements and Preventative Actions:\r\n\r\nWe understand that this is disruptive to your business and are fully committed to taking the necessary steps to prevent recurrence and improve. Following are the main actions:\r\n\r\n- Pause configuration rollouts to perform comprehensive internal audits and reviews of the current process, to develop action plans for improvement\r\n\r\n- Implement a gradual and phased rollout of application metadata configuration changes\r\n\r\n- Increase testing robustness of the configuration deployment tool\r\n\r\n- Improve observability of configuration changes and enhance process steps and validation\r\n\r\n- Add targeted alerting to catch issues before deploying to production cells\r\n\r\n- Add admin notifications of Okta-initiated application changes, and incorporating these into release notes\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we understand our Trust Communications can be more detailed and transparent on the actions that Okta is taking during the event. We also recognize our Support response can be improved for customers during critical events. \r\n\r\n- Improve our communication processes to ensure that Okta is providing greater visibility on our \r\n\r\n- Trust site into what is being done to identify and rectify the issue.\r\n\r\n- Improve Support Case Handling & Resourcing during critical events","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000009mRe0EAE"},"Id":"a1P4z000009mRe0EAE","CreatedDate":"2022-11-06T20:06:18.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000YzhlEAC","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Okta is continuing to work on resolving the issue with email delivery to Yahoo end-users.\r\nImpacted domains include: yahoo.com (yahoo.co.uk, etc.), aol.com, verizon.net, ymail.com, rogers.com, frontier.com, aim.com.

During this time, some customers experienced 504 gateway time-out errors and were unable to access the service. Retries succeeded for some customers. At 8:55am (PT) the issue was rectified and the service was restored.\r\n\r\nOn March 12th at 8:55am (PT), Okta was alerted to errors for Okta service US Cells 1-4, and 12. During this time, a subset of customers in US Cells 1-4, experienced 403 forbidden errors. At 9:46am (PT) the issue was rectified and all customers were restored to normal processing levels. \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary \r\n\r\nAt 8:24am (PT) Okta received increased traffic to US Cell 12 which caused intermittent connectivity issues to Okta’s service. This resulted in request processing time and errors to increase significantly for customers in that cell. \r\n\r\nAt 8:55am (PT) Okta isolated the US Cell 12 traffic to restore service to the cell. Okta applied network rules to further address the issue using internal tooling. Due to a bug in the tooling, a set of rules which were set for observation were incorrectly set to block requests. This caused some customers in US Cells 1-4, and US Cell 12 to experience 403 forbidden errors. \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps \r\n\r\nDuring the incident, Okta deployed traffic management rules to mitigate the impact including moving some traffic to isolated infrastructure, which successfully restored service in US Cell 12.\r\n\r\nDuring the subsequent remediation period, Okta rolled back the incorrectly changed rules manually into observation, which successfully restored service to all customers in US Cells 1-4.\r\n\r\nCommunications \r\n\r\nOkta provided our first update at 11:07 am (PT) which was after the event  was resolved at 9:46 am (PT).   We sincerely apologize for the delayed communications and fully understand the importance in providing accurate, transparent, and timely updates on the status and actions to restore service.  Okta is conducting a review of our communications processes, and will be retraining our customer support team to ensure the timeliness and quality of our communications. \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions \r\n\r\nOkta has fixed the tooling by updating the library to correctly handle the breaking API change. In addition Okta expanded alerting for issues related to the network rule changes for more rapid detection and response, and updating internal tooling bug fixes.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000C1rULEAZ"},"Id":"a1P4z00000C1rULEAZ","CreatedDate":"2024-09-24T10:33:43.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000001BZcCEAW","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Okta’s Engineering Team successfully applied a hotfix release to mitigate the '400 Bad Request' error when federating new domains to all Okta cells except OK7.

Delays and increased error rates were observed within SysLog event processing and Event Hooks (WebHooks). Investigation revealed one of Okta’s cloud service providers was experiencing a regional outage for a data streaming service. The incident began at 5:15 AM PT and impacted Okta US Cell 1, US Cell 2, US Cell 3, US Cell 4, and US Preview Cell 1.\r\n\r\nDuring the incident Okta customers within impacted cells saw gaps in the events timeline displayed within the SysLog Admin Dashboard UI and returned via the System Log API. Other Okta products and features that leverage the impacted streaming service, such as User Search for entity updates and ThreatInsights for event analysis, remained available throughout the impact window and operated with partially stale data until processing delays were resolved. No data was lost during the incident and all events were processed upon recovery.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 3:15PM PT, error rates from the cloud services vendor improved. Okta responded by devoting resources to speed up event processing throughput and recovery time. These optimizations reduced recovery time by up to 5 hours per cell. User Search data lag was resolved by 6:00PM PT across all cells and event processing recovery times per cell were as follows:\r\n\r\nUS Cell 1: began backfill event processing at 5PM PT and all events were fully processed and populated within the system log dashboard by 10:45PM PT.\r\nUS Cell 2 began backfill event processing at 6:55PM PT and observed all events were fully processed and populated within the system log dashboard by 9:50PM PT.\r\nUS Cell 3 began backfill event processing at 5:00PM PT and all events were fully processed and populated within the system log dashboard by 9:40PM PT.\r\nUS Cell 4 began backfill event processing at 7:20PM PT and all events were fully processed and populated within the system log dashboard at 12:20AM PT on November 26th.\r\nUS Preview Cell 1 began backfill event processing at 7:20PM PT and all events were fully processed and populated within the system log dashboard at 9:00AM PT on November 26th. \r\n\r\nFollowing this impact, Okta has identified potential enhancements to improve recovery times in the event of increased error rates related to data streaming service issues.

Okta Verify 6.0.1 had been released to a small user base on the 26th. Okta immediately advised customers through the service Status page to not upgrade manually to Okta Verify 6.0.1 if running iOS 12. Throughout the incident Okta Verify for iOS 13 and iOS 14, as well as Okta Verify for Android, continued to work as expected.\r\n\r\nFurther investigation determined that an incorrect app metadata change erroneously allowed iOS 12 users to download and install Okta Verify 6.0.1. Okta then initiated a parallel effort to address the issue:\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, on November 28th Okta released Okta Verify 6.0.2 and removed 6.0.1 from the Apple App Store. Metadata in Okta Verify 6.0.2 was appropriately tagged as not supporting iOS 12. Since Okta had removed 6.0.1 from the App Store, users on iOS 12, wanting to download Okta Verify, would be given Okta Verify version 5.9.0, the last release of Okta Verify that was compatible with iOS 12. Okta notified customers through its Status page that users in need of an immediate solution could delete and reinstall the app.\r\n\r\nAs a long term fix, on November 29th Okta released Okta Verify 6.0.4, which reinstated support for iOS 12 and allowed users to upgrade seamlessly.\r\n\r\nOkta is expanding its test matrix to consistently validate that devices running unsupported iOS and Android operating system versions do not receive Okta application upgrades.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P1Y000009QRF2UAO"},"Id":"a1P1Y000009QRF2UAO","CreatedDate":"2020-12-15T16:23:32.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C1Y0000008PfEUAU","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Root Cause Analysis:\r\nOn Wednesday December 9th at approximately 9:50 pm (PST) Okta detected an increase in error rates for users in EMEA Cell EU1.

End-User, Admin and API requests within Okta tenants within US Cell 6 were slow, unresponsive, or encountered HTTP 5xx errors.\r\n\r\nThe disruption was the result of a memory issue which impacted the cell's Redis cluster which is used to cache application data. The root cause of the memory issue was traced to a combination of high memory usage within the Redis cluster, a mis-configured application server which increased the volume of caching above expected levels, and sub-optimal Redis configuration settings. Because both the primary and secondary Redis tiers were equally impacted by the increased memory demands, the cluster was unable to recover.

This affected both individual users and organizations relying on SMS-based multi-factor authentication.\r\n\r\n \r\nRoot Cause:\r\n\r\nThe disruption in SMS OTP delivery was caused by the sudden enforcement of regulatory changes implemented by China Mobile, one of China’s largest mobile carriers, on August 6, 2024. This change required all SMS messages sent to China to include a pre-registered signature associated with a local Chinese entity. As a result, SMS traffic originating from brands without a Chinese presence was blocked or filtered by the local carrier, leading to widespread delivery failures.\r\n\r\n \r\nPreventive Actions:\r\n\r\nOkta teams have worked with our telephony providers to establish a more robust routing mechanism that includes pre-registered Chinese entity signatures to comply with local regulations.\r\n\r\nAdditional details about the new standard signatures can be found here: https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/new-standard-signatures-applied-to-sms-sent-to-certain-chinese-carriers\r\n\r\n \r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nOkta strongly recommends customers adopt alternative MFA methods, which are more reliable and less susceptible to local regulatory changes compared to SMS-based OTPs.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000CC0i6EAD"},"Id":"a1P4z00000CC0i6EAD","CreatedDate":"2024-12-18T23:59:01.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000001BZg9EAG","UpdateLog\_\_c":"We sincerely apologize for any impact this incident has caused to you, your business, and your customers.

We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this incident.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDetection and Impact \r\n\r\nOn October 28th at 5:06 AM (PT), Okta was alerted that a few customers experienced delays related to imports in US Cell 14. During this time customers may have observed delayed imports as a result, delays in user activation, provisioning, password sync and additional async tasks At 9:38am(PT) task processing in the cell was restored to normal processing times. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nThis issue was a result of a build up of both active and queued asynchronous tasks.

At Okta trust and transparency are our top priorities. Outlined below are the facts regarding this a recent incident that may have disrupted your ability to use some functionality of the Okta service.\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact:\r\n\r\nOn April 4th from 3:30PM PT to 8:13PM PT, Okta staged, tested and deployed new LDAPi certificates to all Cells. On April 5th, 2022 at 7:43AM PT, Okta began receiving customer reports that their LDAPi integrations experienced validation issues when connecting to secure LDAPi services. Not all customer integrations were impacted as many correctly validated and accepted the new certificate.\r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary:\r\n\r\nThe impact was isolated to customers who used LDAPi enabled applications or services that could not automatically use the renewed SSL certificate. Okta determined that the new LDAPi certificates were issued with a new vendor-supplied ICA chain. The new chain depended on a new root certificate and, depending on the application used, customers may have needed to revalidate the new chain to continue to use SSL LDAPi services. \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nAt 7:59AM PT, Okta rolled back the certificate to the previous certificate. This alleviated the issue for most customers as the previous certificate was still valid. The rollback procedure was initiated spanning across all Cells which completed at 9:42AM PT and resolved the issue. In discussion with the certificate vendor, an updated renewed certificate will be generated to be compatible with the previous ICA chain before the expiration date of the certificate.\r\n\r\nPreventive Actions:\r\n\r\nReviews of certificate changes are continuing with the vendor. We will focus on improving customer communications in the case of vendor supplied ICA chain updates in future certificates updates to help prevent similar issues, as well as a recurrence of this issue. While our goal is to keep ICA chains as constant as possible, certificate vendors will need to make changes for various reasons and at various times. Okta will communicate changes as best as possible. \r\n\r\nDuration (# of minutes): 809","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000009mSK1EAM"},"Id":"a1P4z000009mSK1EAM","CreatedDate":"2023-03-03T17:14:04.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000YznUEAS","UpdateLog\_\_c":"We are working on a process to restore the missing records.

At Okta, trust and transparency are our top priorities. Outlined below are the facts regarding this incident. We are committed to implementing improvements to the service to prevent future occurrences of this kind.\r\n\r\nDetection and Impact \r\n\r\nOn September 26th at 10:46 am (PT), reports of errors on the Workflows History page began to surface. Customers may have experienced timeouts or errors attempting to load flow history in the Workflows Console. Following a brief resolution, at 7:05 am (PT) on September 27th Okta was alerted to similar timeouts and loading errors. \r\n\r\nRoot Cause Summary\r\n\r\nThis issue was a result of an unforeseen volume of long running search activity that overwhelmed the available infrastructure resources. A critical piece of infrastructure was unable to process the increase in demand leading to interruptions on the Workflows History page. Flows continued to run normally during this time, however history processing was delayed.\r\n\r\nRemediation Steps\r\n\r\nUpon receiving alerts, Okta immediately began diagnosing the issue. Okta identified that data storage infrastructure supporting flow history was unresponsive, and began to take corrective actions to stabilize the infrastructure.

An upgrade to a library which processes the Netsuite API XML responses was discovered and confirmed to be the root cause of the issue. The newer version had a change in behavior in handling certain unicode characters. The impacted code had been rolled to production on December 13th and the first reports were received from customers on December 16th. \r\n\r\nRemediation Steps:\r\n\r\nThe root cause was identified by Okta engineering early in the morning (PT) of December the 17th and the fix was deployed as a hotfix to all cells on December 17th by 10:30PM PT.  Upon release, observed errors ceased. \r\n\r\nPreventative Actions:\r\n\r\nAdditional testing and monitoring are being added to prevent similar issues, as well as a recurrence of this issue, in the future.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z00000C1rThEAJ"},"Id":"a1P4z00000C1rThEAJ","CreatedDate":"2024-08-13T10:44:21.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z000000TXIdEAO","UpdateLog\_\_c":"We continue to investigate the AD agents connection issue on OK14, we will update this message with more information as soon as it becomes available.","CurrencyIsoCode":"USD"},{"attributes":{"type":"IncidentUpdate\_\_c","url":"/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/IncidentUpdate\_\_c/a1P4z000007sumdEAA"},"Id":"a1P4z000007sumdEAA","CreatedDate":"2022-08-10T15:30:21.000+0000","IncidentId\_\_c":"a9C4z0000012OU3EAM","UpdateLog\_\_c":"Okta is currently investigating an issue reported with Active Directory Agents in US Cell-3, US Cell-6, US Cell-7, US Cell-11, US Cell-12 and US Cell-14.
