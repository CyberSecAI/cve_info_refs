     "summary": "CVE-2022-1117 is a vulnerability in fapolicyd where the dynamic linker path was not correctly prepared due to a faulty regular expression during build time. This allows local unprivileged users to execute arbitrary code using the dynamic linker.",
      "details": "The vulnerability arises from an incorrect assumption about how glibc names the runtime linker (ld.so). The build script used a regular expression that was not robust enough to handle changes in naming conventions. This resulted in fapolicyd failing to correctly identify the dynamic linker, allowing unauthorized execution of code. Multiple sources confirm that the vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution by local, unprivileged users.",
    "resolution": "The issue was resolved by correcting the regular expression and build process to properly detect the dynamic linker. Patches were released in Red Hat Security Advisories RHSA-2022:1898 and RHSA-2022:4824."
