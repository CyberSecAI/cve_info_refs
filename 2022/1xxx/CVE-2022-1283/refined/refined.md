The provided content relates to CVE-2022-1283.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference in the `r_bin_ne_get_entrypoints` function of the radare2 project's NE (New Executable) parser. Specifically, the code does not properly check if `bin->entry_table` is NULL before dereferencing it, leading to a crash when it is NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash, leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- A specially crafted NE file can trigger the null dereference when parsed by radare2, which could happen when a user analyzes a malicious binary file using radare2.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a crafted NE file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by radare2.
