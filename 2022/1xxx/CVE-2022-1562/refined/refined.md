- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Enable SVG plugin does not sanitize uploaded SVG files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Malicious SVG files can be uploaded and executed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript code execution in the victim's browser when accessing the uploaded SVG file directly.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading a malicious SVG file through the WordPress media library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have at least an "Author" role within the WordPress instance to upload files via the media library.
