Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-1998:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
The provided information directly relates to CVE-2022-1998, as confirmed by the advisory title and the CVE ID mentioned within the text.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an error in how the Linux kernel handles file descriptor installation and subsequent error conditions, specifically after the `fd_install()` function is called.  The core issue is that after installing a file descriptor, the kernel may attempt to clean up resources (by releasing the file structure), while the file descriptor remains valid and accessible to user-space. This happens when a later operation fails (e.g. `copy_to_user()`) after `fd_install()` has already been invoked.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Use-after-free:**  The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition.  Specifically, the kernel attempts to free a 'file' structure after the file descriptor associated with it has already been made available to user space through `fd_install()`. If a thread tries to close a file descriptor while the kernel is still attempting to access the underlying `file` structure due to an error condition, a use-after-free can occur.
   - **Erroneous Error Handling:** The code attempts to recover from an error by releasing resources, but does so incorrectly, using the put_unused_fd(fd) or fput(file) functions, on resources which are not in fact unused and instead are accessible to user-space. This incorrect cleanup logic is triggered by the failure of operations that happen *after* `fd_install()` such as `copy_to_user()`, which copies kernel data to userspace.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially access sensitive information by reusing a file descriptor.  When the memory associated with the released file object is reallocated for a different file object, they may gain access to file-related data of the newly allocated file, if the file descriptor is still valid and not closed.
    - **Data Modification:** An attacker could modify data indirectly by triggering the re-allocation of a file structure, and then acting on the file that now occupies that space, if the file descriptor for the old file remains accessible and is not closed.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can potentially cause a denial of service.
    
**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The primary attack vector involves exploiting the faulty error handling within the kernel after calling the `fd_install()` function, and trying to make sense of the file descriptor or the file structure after.
   - An attacker can create a concurrent thread that is constantly trying to close the file descriptor while the kernel is attempting to copy data to userland. If the copy operation fails, it triggers the vulnerability as the kernel attempts to free the underlying file structure via `put_unused_fd` or `fput` functions.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered through local access to the system, with a low level of privilege. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path by, for example, opening and interacting with affected files.
     - For the `fanotify` vulnerability a privileged user is required with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capability. The `fastrpc` vulnerability is reachable without such privileges.

**7. Specific Affected Products:**
    - The vulnerability is present in multiple NetApp products that incorporate Linux kernels within the versions of 5.1 to 5.17:rc2.
    - The NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S and H410C are affected by this vulnerability.
    - Many other NetApp products are listed as *not affected*.

**8.  Additional Technical details from Seclists.org:**

   - The `seclists.org` entry provides further technical details about the bug pattern and the specific vulnerable code paths in the Linux kernel (specifically within `fanotify` and the `fastrpc` driver):
     -  It explains that `fd_install()` makes the file descriptor reachable by userland, so any reasoning about the file object or descriptor after that is unsafe.
     -  It details how an attacker can trigger a use-after-free by causing `copy_to_user()` or a similar operation to fail. This happens when the kernel is trying to copy kernel data to userspace after the file has been installed with `fd_install()`.
     - It explains how  a concurrent thread calling `close(fd)` in a tight loop can help trigger this vulnerability, because the file descriptor allocation is predictable.
   - The `fanotify` vulnerability is reachable by privileged users (with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`), while the `fastrpc` vulnerability does not require such privileges.
   - The `fastrpc` vulnerability is described as "even worse", because it's missing the `put_unused_fd()` function. This means, a new file descriptor gets created while an old 'file' structure, is still being used after being closed.

**9. Remediation:**
    - NetApp states that there are currently no fixes planned for the affected NetApp HCI BMC products, and directs customers to an End of Availability (EOA) announcement.
    - The `seclists.org` information mentions that fixes for the `fanotify` and `fastrpc` code paths are available as patches in the kernel.  The fanotify patch delays the fd_install call. The fastrpc patch is also available at the provided link.

In summary, CVE-2022-1998 highlights a critical vulnerability stemming from improper error handling after file descriptor installation in the Linux kernel which can be triggered through local access and may lead to information disclosure, data modification and/or Denial of Service.  The provided documents clearly link the vulnerability to the specified CVE and provide a detailed analysis of the underlying issues.
