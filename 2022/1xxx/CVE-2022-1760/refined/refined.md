{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not have CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in place when updating its settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF vulnerability that allows attackers to make a logged in admin change settings.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify the plugin's settings without the victim's consent.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can craft malicious HTML forms or use iframes that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, can submit requests to change plugin settings.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious page or link that triggers the CSRF attack."
