- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An obfuscated backdoor injected within the plugin's license checking code. This backdoor registers a REST API handler that allows arbitrary PHP code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE).
  - Use of an obfuscated backdoor.
  - Insecure REST API handler.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the vulnerable website, leading to complete compromise of the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the registered REST API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or specific positioning, making it easily exploitable.
