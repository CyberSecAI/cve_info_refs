{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly generate the Javascript access token for preventing abuse of comment section.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The plugin's Javascript access token, intended to prevent comment spam, can be easily collected by attackers.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can bypass comment spam protection, allowing them to post arbitrary comments.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker collects the 'ssc_key' value from the target website and includes it in a POST request to the 'wp-comments-post.php' endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to access the target website and observe the HTML source to retrieve the ssc_key value."
