- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the vulnerable plugin settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must be a high-privilege user (e.g., administrator) and inject malicious scripts into specific settings fields. The vulnerable settings are located in "Admin Email Settings -> Client Email Settings" (Domain Email, Mail To, Cc, Bcc, Subject) and "Admin Email Settings" (Domain Email, Mail To, Subject)
