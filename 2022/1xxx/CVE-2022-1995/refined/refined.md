- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-supplied input within its settings, specifically within the "Advanced Blocking" tab > "Block HTTP Referer's" section > "Add Referer" field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the affected settings page if `unfiltered_html` is disallowed. This can lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the website, when a user views the settings page.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrator privileges can input malicious Javascript code into the plugin settings through the "Add Referer" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator-level access to the WordPress site.
