- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Fuji Electric Alpha7 PC Loader software when processing a specially crafted project file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves processing a malicious project file using the Alpha7 PC Loader software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to create and provide a crafted project file to the user. The user must then open the malicious file using the vulnerable software on their local machine. The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
