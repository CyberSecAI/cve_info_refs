- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Post Styling" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in several actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing CSRF checks, leading to multiple CSRF vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially trick a logged-in administrator into performing unintended actions such as:
    - Deleting plugin data
    - Updating plugin settings
    - Adding new entries to the plugin's data
- **Attack vectors:** CSRF attacks are performed by tricking a logged-in administrator to submit malicious requests without their knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into accessing a malicious webpage or link which causes the browser to submit malicious requests to the vulnerable plugin. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the application but has to target an authenticated user.
