The provided content relates to a path traversal vulnerability fix in the `filegator/filegator` repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided paths when constructing file paths within the `Filesystem.php` class. Specifically, the code was vulnerable to path traversal using `..` sequences in paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability: The application did not properly sanitize path inputs, allowing attackers to potentially access files outside of the intended directory.
- The `escapeDots` function was introduced to remove `..` sequences, but it did not handle all possible variations of the attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could read sensitive files outside of the intended directory, which could potentially lead to information disclosure or further exploitation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulating file paths by including `..` sequences, potentially in combination with `/` or `\` to traverse up directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate the file paths used by the application. This could happen in various parts of the application where file paths are used, e.g., when accessing or downloading files.
