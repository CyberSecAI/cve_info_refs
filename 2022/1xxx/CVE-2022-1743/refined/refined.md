**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ImageCast X system can be manipulated using specially crafted election definition files, leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Path traversal vulnerability ('../FILEDIR') in how the system handles election definition files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could spread malicious code to ImageCast X devices from the Election Management System (EMS). This could potentially compromise the integrity of the voting process.

**Attack vectors:**
Crafting malicious election definition files and uploading them through the EMS to ImageCast X devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to create and upload manipulated election definition files to the EMS, from where they can be distributed to the ImageCast X devices.
