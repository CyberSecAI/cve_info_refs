{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks CSRF protection when updating settings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)",
    "Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) due to lack of sanitization of some settings"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can, via a CSRF attack, force a logged in administrator to change plugin settings. Due to the lack of sanitization, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the settings, leading to stored XSS when these settings are displayed.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted form that exploits the missing CSRF protection. This form can be embedded on any page/site the attacker controls, where a logged in admin would visit.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a page containing a malicious form. The attacker does not need any prior authentication on the victim WordPress site."
