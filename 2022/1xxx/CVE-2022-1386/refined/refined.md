Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Fusion Builder plugin, used within the Avada theme, fails to properly validate a parameter in its forms. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is an unauthenticated SSRF. The plugin doesn't validate the `fusionAction` parameter, which is used to initiate HTTP requests.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue stems from the plugin's failure to sanitize or validate user-provided input for the `fusionAction` and `fusionActionMethod` parameters.
*   **Reflected Response:** The data returned from the attacker-controlled HTTP request is reflected back in the application's response, which can be used for further exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Internal Network Access:** An attacker can exploit the SSRF to interact with hosts within the server's local network. This could bypass firewalls and other access controls.
*   **Information Disclosure:** By making requests to internal services, the attacker could potentially gather sensitive information.
*   **Denial of Service:** Although not explicitly mentioned, making numerous requests may impact the availability of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated Parameters:** The attacker controls the `fusionAction` parameter (URL) and `fusionActionMethod` parameter (HTTP method), allowing them to specify the destination and type of the HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No prior authentication or privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
*  **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters**: The attacker must know the target endpoint `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` and the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Fusion Builder versions prior to 3.6.2 and in Avada theme versions prior to 7.6.2.
* The issue is classified under OWASP Top 10 as A1: Injection.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
*   The CVSS score is 8.6, which is considered "high."
