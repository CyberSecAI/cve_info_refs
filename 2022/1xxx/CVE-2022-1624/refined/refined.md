- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress plugin "Latest Tweets Widget" lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when updating its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF checks, allowing an attacker to forge requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the plugin's settings through a CSRF attack. The provided proof of concept demonstrates the ability to change the `consumer_key`, `consumer_secret`, `access_key`, and `access_secret` parameters.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a CSRF attack. An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form that, when loaded by a logged-in administrator, will submit a request to modify the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator into loading the malicious HTML page. The administrator needs to be logged into the target WordPress site for the CSRF attack to work.
