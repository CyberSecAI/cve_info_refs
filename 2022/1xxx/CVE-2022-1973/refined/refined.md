Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-1973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists in the `ntfs3` file system's `log_replay` function within the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double-free: The same memory location is freed twice which leads to memory corruption.
- Use-after-free : While not explicitly stated as the root cause, the provided text states a use-after-free flaw exists.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double-free can lead to a system crash, disrupting normal operations.
- **Information Disclosure:** The use-after-free mentioned in the Red Hat Bugzilla entry could lead to a kernel information leak

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: This vulnerability can be triggered by a local attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `fs/ntfs3/fslog.c` file within the kernel's source code.
- Red Hat states that no shipped kernel versions were affected.
- NetApp mentions that products incorporating Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.19 are susceptible to this vulnerability.
- NetApp lists specific affected products (NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S and H410C) but notes there are no plans to address the vulnerability on these products.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.1 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H, indicating local access is required and that successful exploitation could result in high impact to confidentiality and availability.
