Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-1343:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `OCSP_basic_verify` function in OpenSSL incorrectly handles the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag. When this flag is used (which is not the default), the function will report a successful verification even if the response signing certificate fails to verify.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Certificate Validation:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the OCSP response verification is performed when the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag is enabled. The function fails to properly check the validity of the signing certificate in this specific scenario.
*   **Misleading Verification Results:** The OCSP verification can return a positive result even when the underlying certificate check has failed.
*   **Command line application issue:** The command line application also incorrectly reports success.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Spoofing/Bypass:** An attacker could potentially present a fraudulent OCSP response that would be incorrectly verified as valid when `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag is used. This can be used to bypass revocation checks in certain cases.
*   **Misleading information:** Users relying on the OCSP verify function, or the command line tool with the no_cert_checks flag, would get a false sense of security, as they are told that the certificate is verified when it's not.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or provide a malicious OCSP response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Position:** An attacker needs to be able to intercept or control the OCSP response provided to the target application.
*  **Understanding of OCSP:** Attacker needs to be able to forge a OCSP response.
*   **Target Application configuration:** The target application must be using the `OCSP_basic_verify` function with the `OCSP_NOCHECKS` flag set or the command line tool with the "-no_cert_checks" flag

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects OpenSSL version 3.0 and is fixed in 3.0.3.
*   The issue also affects the command-line "ocsp" application when using the "-no_cert_checks" flag.
*   The provided NetApp document indicates that several of their products are affected, particularly those that use OpenSSL.
*   The Siemens advisory states that their Brownfield Connectivity - Client is affected by this vulnerability.
