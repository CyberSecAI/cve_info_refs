**Attack vectors:**
- By adding malicious JavaScript code to the "slug" input field when creating or editing a slider project.
- By importing a JSON configuration file containing a malicious payload in the slug field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges or higher in WordPress.
