- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various consequences, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., Admin) can inject malicious payloads into the text fields within the plugin's settings page (`/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mihdan-no-external-links&tab=links`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges, such as administrative access to the WordPress site.
