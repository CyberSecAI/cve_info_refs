## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Mihdan: No External Links < 5.0.2 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of its settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed (for example in multisite setup)

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in any of the text fields in the Settings > Links of the plugin (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=mihdan-no-external-links&tab=links):
v < 4.8.0 - "><img src onerror=prompt(/XSS/)>
v < 5.0.2 - " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//

### Affects Plugins
