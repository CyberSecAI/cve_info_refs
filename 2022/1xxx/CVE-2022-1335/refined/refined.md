- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape Slide's descriptions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the slide descriptions which are then executed when a user views the page/post containing the slideshow. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin privileges can create or edit a slideshow and inject the malicious script within the description field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least administrative privileges within the WordPress instance.
