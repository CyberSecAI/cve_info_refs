Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-1723:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of URLs in the `EmbedServlet2` and `ProxyServlet` classes within the draw.io application. The application was not properly sanitizing URLs before using them to fetch external resources.
*   **Weaknesses:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper URL sanitization which could allow Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The code initially had a `checkUrlParameter` method with many checks that was replaced with a `sanitizeUrl` method in the Utils class.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit this to make the server perform requests to internal resources or arbitrary external URLs that should be restricted. This could lead to information disclosure (by accessing internal resources) or further attacks on other systems the server can communicate with.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could provide a malicious URL as a parameter to the affected servlets.
    *   The `EmbedServlet2` and `ProxyServlet` servlets are specifically targeted.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application and control the `url` parameter for the affected servlets.

**Technical Details:**

*   The commit `7a68ebe22a64fe722704e9c4527791209fee2034` introduces changes to address the vulnerability by implementing the `sanitizeUrl` function in `Utils.java` and using this to check URLs in `EmbedServlet2.java` and `ProxyServlet.java`.
*   The `sanitizeUrl` method in `Utils.java` performs a check to ensure the URL is using http/https protocol, and also blocks access to local addresses such as loopback, link-local, and private IP ranges. It also blocks specific hostnames like those ending in `.internal` or `.local`, or containing `localhost` as well as reverse DNS lookups and IPv6 link local addresses.
*   The commit also moves the URL sanitization from `ProxyServlet` to the `Utils` class, implementing it in the EmbedServlet2, and ProxyServlet and removing the `checkUrlParameter` method from `ProxyServlet`.
*   The `ChangeLog` indicates "Moves sanitize URL to Utils, adds extra IPv6 check" and "Adds additional checks for hyperlinks" suggesting the commit addresses reported SSRF issues.
*   The previous `checkUrlParameter` method in `ProxyServlet.java` is replaced by the call to the `sanitizeUrl` method from the `Utils.java` class

**Summary:**

The provided content details a patch for an SSRF vulnerability in draw.io. The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper URL sanitization in the `EmbedServlet2` and `ProxyServlet` servlets, which could allow an attacker to make the server perform requests to internal resources or arbitrary external URLs. The fix involves the implementation of a more thorough URL sanitization function (`sanitizeUrl`) in the `Utils` class and applying it to the affected servlets.
