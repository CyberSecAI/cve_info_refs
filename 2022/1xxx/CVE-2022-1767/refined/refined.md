Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the changes related to potential vulnerabilities:

**Summary:**
The provided content is a commit diff for the drawio project. It includes several changes, some of which are directly related to security. Specifically, the commit addresses issues in redirect handling within the proxy servlet, adjusts CORS regex checks and disables navigation in the electron app.

**Specific Changes and Potential Vulnerabilities:**

*   **`src/main/java/com/mxgraph/online/AbsAuthServlet.java`**:
    *   **Change:** The logic for checking if a URL is absolute is modified to use `uri.isAbsolute()` and handle `URISyntaxException` by returning `true`.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Previously malformed URLs were ignored, now they are blocked, thus preventing potential bypasses of URL validation.
    *   **Root Cause:** Inadequate URL validation and exception handling.
    *   **Weakness:**  Potential for SSRF or open redirects if malformed URLs are not properly handled
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks or redirects to unexpected locations.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By providing a malformed URL in a request to the servlet.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the affected service.

*   **`src/main/java/com/mxgraph/online/ProxyServlet.java`**:
    *   **Change:** `setInstanceFollowRedirects(false)` is set to prevent automatic redirect following, and a manual redirect handling is implemented. The regex for CORS checks is updated with `^` to ensure a more accurate match at the beginning of the referer. The redirect handling logic now uses `(int)(status / 10) == 30` to check for any 30x redirect code.
    *   **Vulnerability:** The previous code was potentially vulnerable to open redirects or SSRF if redirects were not handled properly. By disabling automatic following and implement manual redirect with limit, the vulnerability is mitigated. Incorrect regex for CORS checks could potentially allow unauthorized access, but the change to `^` should prevent that.
    *  **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of redirects and an inadequate regex for CORS check.
    *   **Weakness:** Potential for SSRF or open redirects and CORS bypasses.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposing internal services, arbitrary code execution or unauthorized access.
    *   **Attack Vector:** By providing a URL that redirects to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to make HTTP requests to the affected service.

*   **`src/main/webapp/electron.js`**:
    *  **Change**: Navigation is disabled using `contents.on('will-navigate', ...)` and `contents.setWindowOpenHandler(...)` to limit creation of new windows to `about:blank` and URLs explicitly allowed by the `openExternal` function.
    *  **Vulnerability**: Previously, the electron app could open arbitrary URLs, posing a security risk if an attacker can manipulate the app.
    * **Root Cause**:  Insecure handling of navigation and window creation.
    * **Weakness**:  Potential for unauthorized navigation, XSS, arbitrary code execution or unexpected browser behavior.
    * **Impact**:  Opening arbitrary URLs in the Electron app, including potential malicious links or code.
    * **Attack Vector**:  Manipulating the app to trigger navigation to malicious URLs or creation of new windows.
    * **Required Capabilities**:  Ability to control or manipulate the app.

*  **`src/main/webapp/js/app.min.js`**:
   * **Change**: The version of `mxClient` was updated from `18.0.6` to `18.0.7`.
   *  **Vulnerability**: This is not directly a vulnerability. It's a part of the release and may include other security-related fixes that are not explicit. This is related to the other changes in the files.

**Summary of changes:**
-   The commit introduces better security practices by not following redirects automatically in proxy servlet and handling redirects explicitly.
-   The fix also handles malformed URLs and updates the regex for CORS checks.
-   The commit also adds restrictions to navigation in the electron app to prevent arbitrary URL loading.

**CVE Relevance:**
The changes to `AbsAuthServlet.java` and `ProxyServlet.java` in this commit appear to be related to the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-1767, though without the official CVE description it is hard to be sure.
The changes to `electron.js` are a clear security improvement to avoid potential issues.

**Conclusion:**

The provided commit contains changes that directly address potential vulnerabilities in the handling of redirects, URL validation and CORS checks in drawio's proxy servlet, and navigation in the electron app, which aligns with security best practices and can mitigate some of the vulnerabilities addressed by CVE-2022-1767.
