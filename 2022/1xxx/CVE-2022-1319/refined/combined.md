For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes the connection.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2073890#c0)  Sandipan Roy    2022-04-11 04:31:39 UTC  ``` For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets and those 'END RESPONSE' packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss does close the connection. So when httpd reuses that connection after a 400 for something like a cping, it will receive a failure since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=2073890#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-06 15:12:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2022:4922 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4922](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A4922)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=2073890#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-06 15:52:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 on RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2022:4918 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4918](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A4918)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=2073890#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2022-06-06 15:59:17 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.4 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2022:4919 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022:4919](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2022%3A4919)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=2073890#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-06-06 20:32:16 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
