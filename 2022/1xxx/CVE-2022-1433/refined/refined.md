```json
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a failure to invalidate existing cached fields containing vulnerable rendered HTML after implementing input sanitization. While the input was being sanitized before rendering, existing cached versions of the data were not, allowing old malicious content to persist.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Inadequate cache invalidation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of users viewing the affected notes. This can lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions within the context of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to inject malicious script content into a note field. Because of the lack of sanitization of stored values in cache, the vulnerability can persist even after mitigations were deployed.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a user capable of creating or editing notes. The attacker does not require any special privileges or to be in a privileged network position."
