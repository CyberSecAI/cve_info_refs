- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `wpcargo_tracking_number` parameter before outputting it on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, redirecting to malicious sites, stealing cookies, and more.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `wpcargo_tracking_number` parameter and tricks the victim into visiting the URL. The vulnerable page reflects the payload in the response causing the browser to execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking it or visiting the page.
