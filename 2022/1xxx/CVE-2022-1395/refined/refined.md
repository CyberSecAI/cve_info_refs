- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape its settings, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will be executed in the browsers of users who access the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, and defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by inserting a malicious payload into the plugin's settings (such as Font size, Font Color).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires a high-privilege user role (e.g., admin) in WordPress to access the plugin's settings and save the malicious payload. The vulnerability is only exploitable when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed for the high privileged user.
