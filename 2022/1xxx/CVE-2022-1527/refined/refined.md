- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape a parameter before outputting it back in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities within the user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes the XSS payload within the `settings_error` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to entice a user to click the malicious URL, usually, this will be an administrator.
