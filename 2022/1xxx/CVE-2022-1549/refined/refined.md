The provided content is related to CVE-2022-1549.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Athletics" fails to sanitize user-provided parameters before storing them in the database, and it does not escape these values when displaying them in the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website that will be executed in the browsers of administrators when they view the affected admin page. This could lead to the attacker gaining control over the administrator's session, potentially leading to further malicious actions, such as data theft or website compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a form available to subscriber-level users that allows them to submit race results. Specifically, the "Event Name" field is vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have at least a subscriber account. The attacker injects the payload through a form, and the administrator will trigger the XSS when visiting the admin page.
