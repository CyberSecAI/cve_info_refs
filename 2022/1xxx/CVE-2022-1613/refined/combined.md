## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Restricted Site Access < 7.3.2 - Access Bypass via IP Spoofing

### Description

The plugin prioritizes getting a visitor's IP from certain HTTP headers over PHP's REMOTE\_ADDR, which makes it possible to bypass IP-based limitations in certain situations.

### Proof of Concept

Set HTTP\_CF\_CONNECTING\_IP or any of the other headers in get\_client\_ip\_address() to spoof the IP address.
