- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin prioritizes obtaining a visitor's IP address from certain HTTP headers (like `HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP`) over the PHP `REMOTE_ADDR` variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** IP address spoofing. The plugin incorrectly trusts user-supplied headers for IP address determination, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can bypass IP-based restrictions enforced by the plugin, gaining unauthorized access to restricted content.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by setting specific HTTP headers like `HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP` to a spoofed IP address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, and they must be able to set or manipulate HTTP headers.
