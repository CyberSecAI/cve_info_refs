  "CVE-2022-1419": {
    "description": "Minh Yuan discovered a race condition in the vgem virtual GPU driver that can lead to a use-after-free. A local user permitted to access the GPU device can exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.",
    "root_cause": "The ioctl$DRM_IOCTL_MODE_DESTROY_DUMB can decrease refcount of *drm_vgem_gem_object* (created in *vgem_gem_dumb_create*) concurrently, and *vgem_gem_dumb_create* will access the freed drm_vgem_gem_object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Concurrency issue leading to use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (crash or memory corruption), potential for privilege escalation.",
