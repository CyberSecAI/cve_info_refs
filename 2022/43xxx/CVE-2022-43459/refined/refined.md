- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Forms by CaptainForm plugin <= 2.5.3 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious actor could force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, executes unwanted actions on the vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated but needs to trick an authenticated user into submitting the malicious request.
