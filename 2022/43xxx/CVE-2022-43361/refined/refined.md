The provided content relates to CVE-2022-43361.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to unfiltered input from the `$_GET['filter']` parameter in `pop_chart.php`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation and sanitization of the `filter` parameter in the `pop_chart.php` file, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions such as:
  - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
  - Modifying the content of the web page.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code within the `filter` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send a malicious URL to the target user and the user must access the vulnerable page while logged in as administrator.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific vulnerable file is `pop_chart.php` (lines 43-70).
- An example payload is: `http://localhost/admin/modules/reporting/pop_chart.php?filter=2022%20%27><script>alert(%270xdc9%27);</script>`.
- The injected script is executed on the user's browser when the page is rendered.
