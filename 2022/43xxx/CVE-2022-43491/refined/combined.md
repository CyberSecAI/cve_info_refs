## Description

This plugin helps you quickly set discounts and pricing rules for your WooCommerce store.

Set up any kind of discount or dynamic pricing you like, and activate/deactivate rules as needed.

Configure fixed dollar amount adjustments, percentage adjustments, or set fixed price for the product or group of products.

Also supports role-based prices & bulk pricing. **Bulk tables can be designed with Customizer.** You should setup bulk rule for category/product at first and enable “Show Bulk Table” at tab “Settings”.

#### Some Examples

* Category-level discounts – discount products and provide free shipping
* Buy 4(or more) items on Friday and get 20% off
* Buy product X and get product Y for free – immediately added and visible in cart
* Buy a package – discount it (each item separately), and also get a free product
* Apply bulk discount for selected items, available only to wholesale buyers
* Give a 10% discount to all “Accessories”(Category) if a product X is present in the cart

Check more examples [on our website](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/sample-discount/).

#### One pricing rule can

* Filter cart items by products, categories, tags or custom fields
* Modify price for each product separately
* Or set total price for whole set
* Apply cart discounts and fees
* Add free products on fly
* Use tables to get bulk rates
* Validate conditions for cart items, user roles or dates
* Track limits (only “max usage” supported currently)

#### Interface settings

* Show/hide original prices
* Show/hide badge “On Sale”
* Show/hide bulk discount table on the product page
* Set rule for products which already on sale
* Add shortcodes to display discounted or BOGO products at separate pages
* and much more …

[Pro version](https://algolplus.com/plugins/downloads/advanced-dynamic-pricing-woocommerce-pro/?currency=USD) can [adjust product price onfly](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/advanced-features-in-action/), adds \*\*exclusive rules, extra conditions and a lot of settings(which allow you to configure different layouts and scenarios).

## Installation

#### Automatic Installation

Go to WordPress dashboard, click Plugins / Add New , type ‘Advanced Dynamic Pricing for WooCommerce’ and hit Enter.

Install and activate plugin, visit WooCommerce > Pricing Rules.

#### Manual Installation

[Please, visit the link and follow the instructions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

## FAQ

### How can I increase prices in my shop?

You should setup negative discount.

### The plugin slows down my site a lot. Sometimes the cart page just freezes.

It seems your websitе calls external API to do shipping calculations.

Please, visit >WooCommerce>Pricing Rules>Settings>Calculation, mark “Disable shipping calculation” and check speed.

### Free product can’t be added to the cart. I see message “Sorry, this product cannot be purchased.”

WooCommerce verifies product before adding to the cart. So this product must be published, in stock and has price defined.

### How can I hide original prices?

It’s a PRO feature. You should turn off option “Show striked prices” at tab Settings, for category and product pages.

### I don’t see “For sale” badge for variable products

It’s a PRO feature. You should turn on option “Calculate ‘On Sale’ badge for variable products” at tab Settings, section Calculations.

### Is it compatible with WPML? WOOCS ?

Yes.

### Compatibility with my theme/plugin

Free and pro versions use same core, so you can test it using free version. [Please, visit the link to see detailed reply](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/common-faq/)

### How to allow customer to select free product

You should create package rule and set zero price for free product. [Please, check 2nd example](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/bogo-discount-help/)

### How to customize bulk tables or row “amount saved”

You should copy necessary file from folder “BaseVersion/templates” to folder “advanced-dynamic-pricing-for-woocommerce” (create it in active theme)

### The rules are not applied to orders if I use button “Add order” (>WooCommerce>Orders)

This form adds new order directly to the database. But all pricing plugins work with cart items. Use our plugin [Phone Orders](https://wordpress.org/plugins/phone-orders-for-woocommerce/) to add backend orders.

### I can’t change quantity or delete item from cart

It’s a conflict with another plugin which modifies cart items too. You should turn on debugbar and send us report/json file. [Read short guide.](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/debug/)

### I marked checkbox “Add products to cart at normal cost and add coupon…”, but I don’t see any coupons in the cart

You should visit >WooCommerce>Settings and mark “Enable the use of coupon codes”.

### I need custom cart condition

You should be PHP programmer to do it. [Please, review sample addon and adapt it for your needs](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/program-custom-condition/)

### I don’t see my question

[Please, review full FAQ](https://docs.algolplus.com/algol_pricing/common-faq/)

Basically doesn’t work at all.-If I remove coupon code in cart, I get success message that it was removed, but discount is still applied.-it says “apply to all items in cart affected by the rule. but it simply applies discount on all items in cart.-No percentage discount, only fix amount.

My use-case fits the free version available here, but I purchased the paid version to support the dev.
This, in my view, is hands down the most powerful dynamic pricing woo plugin on the market. I’ve tried them all; from YITH, to the new Barn2, to the official Woo, and none of them fit my simple use-case. (I need to select certain attributes for discounts. His is the only one on the market that can do this.)
The software did not cause my site any performance issues, as other reviewers have stated was their experience. You can reference my public comments replying to these negative reviews, in which I ask the dev if he’s fixed the issues. He responded immediately that the performance issues have been resolved; and I can confirm that to be the case, at least in my setup.
While the software works flawlessly, and is extremely powerful, the UX/UI and docs leave a lot to be desired. But this was not an issue for me, however, because I emailed the dev, explained my use case, and he promptly sent me screenshots of the necessary configuration to achieve my goal.
Thank you, Alex! Peace and prosperity.

I was blown away by all the features offered by this plugin. I was looking for something that would allow me to set a discount based on user role. I loved that it added the extra discount section to the cart and checkout pages, and I could even customize the text! The only problem is it massively slowed down my site. Loading the checkout page went from a few seconds to over 20 seconds. Even adding a coupon became slow. After deactivating the plugin the page load sped up again. I wound up installing a different plugin that doesn’t offer as many features but it also doesn’t slow down my site.I would switch back to this in a heartbeat if the developers could fix the performance issue!

A suggestion:
Leave all the “Pro Version” options available for “Preview” in the Free version in text format.This makes it easier to understand all the functions of the versions.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
