- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "tooltip" field of the CMS field add page. This allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they visit the members add page. This could lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "tooltip" field in the CMS Field Add page. An attacker inserts a malicious payload into this field. The injected code is then stored in the database. When the member's add page is accessed, the stored payload is rendered and executed in the browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the CMS field add page, which is likely an administrative panel.
