Question:

Is there a software or device that can record USB data/signal coming into my computer from another device and also allow me to emulate and send that recorded data/signal to my computer later?

Details:

The computer is running on Windows 10. I would prefer the cheapest possible solution, but also want to know what the ideal method would be.

I tried to do some research into this, but I'm only finding software that I don't really understand like "USBPcap" and "Free USB Analyzer". Also, it sounds like they only capture and monitor USB traffic. Nothing suggests that any of these would be able to do the second part which is to emulate the recorded signal.

The reason I want to do this is because I want to replicate the USB device's input to my computer on a daily timer without requiring a person to be present every day at the same time.

I don't care about seeing the actual data packets or knowing any details of the USB protocol. I just want to record the USB input going into my computer and make the computer receive that identical input in the future.

* What's the background of this... is it to, say, wake up the computer?

* I have a system where I have to use a specific USB device in order to activate some programs/appliances. I want them to operate while I'm asleep or not at home. I can handle the daily automation aspect but I need to capture USB signal that would normally come from the device and emulate it.

* Gotcha, software emulating a HASP key?

* I just Googled what a HASP key is and that's not what I'm using. I'm using a USB fingerprint scanner but I don't want to wake up at 4am just to scan my fingerprint and also I need it to run when I'm on vacation. It also doesn't have to be a software solution (although that's probably best) if there exists some physical device that can do it.

# Disclosure Policy

This policy outlines how the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) handles responsible vulnerability disclosure to product vendors,
Trend Micro customers, security vendors, and the general public. ZDI will responsibly and promptly notify the appropriate
product vendor of a security flaw with their product(s) or service(s). The first attempt at contact will be through any
appropriate contacts or formal mechanisms listed on the vendor Web site, or by sending an e-mail to security@, support@,
info@, and secure@company.com with the pertinent information about the vulnerability. Simultaneous to the vendor
notification, protection filters may be distributed to Trend Micro customers through approved channels.

If a vendor fails to acknowledge ZDI initial notification within five business days, ZDI will attempt a second
formal attempt to contact a representative for that vendor. If a vendor fails to respond after an
additional five business days following the second notification, ZDI may rely on an intermediary to try to establish
contact with the vendor. If ZDI exhausts all reasonable means in order to contact a vendor, then ZDI may issue a public
advisory disclosing its findings fifteen business days after the initial contact.

If a vendor response is received within the timeframe outlined above, ZDI will allow the vendor 4-months (120 days)
to address the vulnerability with a security patch or other corrective measure as appropriate. At the end of the
deadline, if a vendor is not responsive or unable to provide a reasonable statement as to why the vulnerability is not
fixed, the ZDI will publish a limited advisory including mitigation in an effort to enable the defensive community to
protect the user. We believe that by taking these actions, the vendor will understand the responsibility they have to
their customers and will react appropriately. Extensions to the 120-day disclosure timeline are up to the sole
discretion of the Zero Day Initiative and will only be granted in rare circumstances.

For vulnerability disclosures resulting from an incomplete or otherwise faulty security patch, ZDI will follow a
tiered disclosure timeline. For Critical-rated bugs where active exploitation is detected or imminent, the vendor will
have 30 days to produce a new security patch or other corrective measure. For Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities
where the original patch does offer some protection and exploitation is not imminent, vendors will be given a disclosure
window of 60 days. All other reports in this category will be given a time of 90 days. For additional details on this
portion of our disclosure policy, please refer to [this blog.](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/8/11/new-disclosure-timelines-for-bugs-from-faulty-patches)

If a product vendor is unable to, or chooses not to, patch a particular security flaw, ZDI will offer to work with
that vendor to publicly disclose the flaw with some effective workarounds. In no cases will an acquired vulnerability be
“kept quiet” because a product vendor does not wish to address it. To maintain transparency into our process, we plan on
publishing a summary of the communication we've had with the vendor regarding the issue. We hope that this level of
insight into our process will allow the community to better understand some of the difficulties vendors have when
remediating high-impact bugs. ZDI will make every effort to work with vendors to ensure they understand the technical
details and severity of a reported security flaw.

ZDI will formally and publicly release its security advisories on our Web site. Only advisories listed on the
website should be considered official ZDI advisories.

## Packet Capture Definition

Packet capture is a networking practice involving the interception of data packets travelling over a network. Once the packets are captured, they can be stored by IT teams for further analysis. The inspection of these packets allows IT teams to identify issues and [solve network problems](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-performance-monitor/use-cases/network-troubleshooting) affecting daily operations.

## What is packet capture used for?

Packet capturing helps to [analyze networks](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-performance-monitor/use-cases/network-monitoring-software), identify network performance issues and [manage network traffic](https://www.solarwinds.com/netflow-traffic-analyzer/use-cases/network-traffic-management). It allows IT teams to detect intrusion attempts, security issues, network misuse, packet loss, and network congestion. It enables network managers to capture data packets directly from the computer network. The process is known as packet sniffing.

IT teams prefer using packet monitor to perform crucial tasks, such as:

* Monitoring WAN utilization
* Monitoring bandwidth and traffic volume
* Tracking network usage
* Isolating compromised systems
* Demonstrating compliance
* Detecting suspicious content
* Identify rogue DHCP
## Importance of packet capture monitoring?

Packet capture enables teams to deal with complex network issues with ease and efficiency. Management of organizations' networks is daunting. It involves checking client IP addresses, DNS servers, and more following the standard tests to identify the root cause of the issues.

Here’s when the [packet capture](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-performance-monitor/use-cases/packet-capture) system greatly helps. A packet monitoring tool can collect and analyze packet data and handle complex network issues quickly. It provides in-depth packet information such as source and destination of IP addresses, time of capture, protocol information, and more.

## Advantages of packet capture

**Enhance your organization's security:** [Packet analysis](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-performance-monitor/use-cases/packet-analyzer) helps in identifying security flaws, breaches, and more. It can detect intrusions, security incidents, and sudden spikes in network traffic.

**Identify data leaks:** Packet analysis and monitoring help IT teams to understand data leakage points and identify the root cause of the issues.

**Locate packet loss:** Packet capture monitoring enables IT teams to retrieve stolen, lost, or exfiltrated data packets by providing a series of events.

**Improve network troubleshooting:** Packet capture monitoring provides full visibility into network resources that help network teams improve troubleshooting efforts.

## What is a PCAP file?

PCAP files are data files created using a program. These files contain packet data of a network and are used to analyze the network characteristics. They also contribute to controlling the network traffic and determining network status. Using PCAP files, teams can attend to detect network problems and resolve data communications using various programs.

## What are the different versions of PCAP files?

There are many versions of a PCAP file with its own set of capabilities and used cases. For example:

* **WinPcap:** WinPcap file format is similar to a portable packet capture library designed specifically for Windows devices.
* **Libpcap:** Libpcap is an open-source C++ library Used by Mac OS and Linux devices to capture and filter packets. It’s mainly used by [packet sniffing tools](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-performance-monitor/use-cases/packet-sniffer).
* **Npcap:** Npcap is a packet sniffing library that supports other Windows devices. This library is known for its fast and secure functionalities.
* **PCAPng:** Users can loopback packet capture injection and sniff loopback packets.
## How do you capture packets?

Capturing and analyzing huge amounts of packets manually can be challenging. It’s difficult for IT teams to stop and analyze each packet traversing through the network.

Using a packet capture tool can help automate the entire process and allow IT teams to capture and store packets to perform packet capture analysis. The packets can be stored on local or off-site storage to make it easier for IT teams to analyze them.

Besides basic monitoring capabilities, the tool offers several features, such as:

* Time stamping of packets arrived
* Collection and parsing packet length, port number, TCP sequence numbers
* Load and import past sessions of the saved capture file
* Extract and export packet data into a single packet capture file
* Real-time view of packets received
## Why should IT teams use network packet capture tools?

**Automatic identification of response:** The tool helps to detect response time to determine performance issues automatically. This helps in improving the overall end-user experience.

**Monitor a huge number of applications instantly:** IT teams can use a network packet capture tool to identify, analyze, inspect, and [monitor network traffic](https://www.solarwinds.com/network-bandwidth-analyzer-pack/use-cases/network-traffic-monitor). It can provide network performance metrics of different applications such as Skype and SQL server instantly. It can also be used to track data volume, transactions, and packet traffic.

**Spot abnormal spikes in traffic:** Unusual traffic spike can be due to a faulty application or a security breach. Packet capture tool allows IT teams to identify the root cause of the issues by tracking network packets. Teams can also set alerts to get instant notifications about intrusion attempts or network issues.

**Improve network traffic analysis:** These tools provide unique dashboards with detailed views of packet information, traffic issues, Time to First Byte, and risk levels.

# usbrply

Convert a .pcap file (captured USB packets) to Python or C code that replays the captured USB commands.

Supported packet sources are:

* Linux Wireshark (via usbmon)
* Windows Wireshark (via USBPcap)

Supported output formats are:

* libusb Python (primary)
* (libusb C: fixme)
* (Linux Kernel C: fixme)
* JSON

Example applications:

* Rapidly reverse engineer and re-implement USB protocols
* Record a proprietary Windows programming sequence and replay on an embedded Linux device
* Snoop USB-serial packets

Questions? Please reach out on github or join #usbrply on Freenode IRC

# Linux installation

```
# Do one of these
# Easier to setup, but slower
sudo pip install python-pcapng
# Much faster, but no longer maintained
sudo apt-get install -y python-libpcap
git clone https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply.git
cd usbrply
sudo python setup.py install

```

# Windows installation

There is probably an easier way to do this but this is what I got to work. Tested on Windows 7 x64

Setup python and pip

* Get the latest Python 3 release (<https://www.python.org/downloads/>)
* I used Python 3.7.8 (Windows x86-64 executable installer)
* Keep default setup options (in particular this will install pip)

Install libusb1

* pip install libusb1

Install usb drivers

* Some USB drivers won't replay. You need to switch their USB drivers to WinUSB. You can use Zadig to switch between USB libraries for a single device.
* <https://zadig.akeo.ie/>
* Run Zadig
* Click on **Options** then **List all devices** then select the USB device that doesn't replay properly and **Replace Driver** with WinUSB

Install

* Open a command prompt
  + Default should be your home dir (ex: C:\Users\mcmaster)
* `python -m venv usbrply`
* `usbrply\Scripts\activate.bat`
* `pip install usbrply`

Test

* If not still in venv (prompt like "(usbrply)" ): `usbrply/Scripts/activate.bat`
* `python usbrply\Scripts\usbrply -h`
  + You should get a help message
* Download and place in your home dir: <https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply-test/raw/master/win1.pcapng>
* `python usbply\Scripts\usbrply win1.pcapng`
  + You should see python code that will reproduce the .pcap file commands

# Sample workflows

## Capturing Windows traffic and replaying traffic in Python:

* Install Wireshark. Make sure you install the USBPcap library
* Start Wireshark
* Connect USB device to computer
* Select which USB device you want to capture by clicking on the tiny blue cogwheel and checking the box next to the USB device you want to capture [![usbPcap](/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply/raw/master/docs/usbPcap.png)](/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply/blob/master/docs/usbPcap.png)
* Double click on the USBPcap to start the capture
* Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Close application
* Stop capture
* Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
* Close Wireshark
* Run: `usbrply --wrapper --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py`
* Assuming your usb device is connected to the computer, go to "Device manager", find your device, right click on it, select "Properties", go to "Details" tab, select "Hardware IDs" from the drop-down, and you will find an entry of a form: HID\VID\_046D&PID\_C05A For this example the vid is 0x046D and the pid is 0xC05A
* Scroll down to the bottom of replay.py and edit the following line:

```
        if (vid, pid) == (**0x0000**, **0x0000**):

```

* Example edited line:

```
        if (vid, pid) == (**0x046D**, **0xC05A**):

```

* Linux: run `python replay.py`
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

## Capturing Windows VM traffic from Linux host and replaying traffic in Python:

Example: program a Xilinx dev board under Linux without knowing anything about the JTAG adapter USB protocol

* On Linux host:
  + Install Wireshark
  + Enable usbmon so Wireshark can capture USB (e.g. `sudo modprobe usbmon`, see <http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB>)
  + Boot Windows VM (ie through VMWare)
  + Start Wireshark. Make sure you have USB permissions (ie you may need to sudo)
  + Connect USB device to computer
  + Use lsusb to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
  + Start catpure on bus from above
  + Attach USB device to Windows guest
* On Windows guest:
  + Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Back on Linux host:
  + Stop capture in Wireshark.
  + Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
  + Run: `usbrply --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py`
  + Detatch USB device from Windows guest
  + Run `python replay.py`
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

## Capturing from Linux Terminal

* Install tshark
* Enable usbmon so tshark can capture USB (e.g. `sudo modprobe usbmon`, see <http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB>)
* Connect USB device to computer
* Use `lsusb` to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
* Start capturing using tshark like: `tshark -i usbmon1 -w capture.pcapng`
  + The usbmon device matches the bus number output from `lsusb` e.g. a device entry starting with `Bus 001 Device 002` would be captured from `usbmon1`.
* Use the device as desired.
* Stop capturing by hitting Ctrl-C.
* Run: `usbrply --device-hi -p capture.pcapng > replay.py`

# Command Line Options

You may need to filter out USB devices. There are two ways to do this:

* `--device-hi`: use the last device enumerated. This works well in most cases, including FX2 renumeration
* `--device DEVICE`: manually specify the USB device used. Get this from lsusb output or Wireshark view

Other useful switches:

* `--rel-pkt`: intended to easier allow diffing two outputs. Ex: what changed in trace for LED on vs LED off?
* `--no-packet-numbers`: alternative to above
* `--fx2`: decode common FX2 commands (ex: CPU reset)
* `--range RANGE`: only decode a specific packet range. Use along with Wireshark GUI or refine a previous decode
* see `--help` for more

# JSON output

use -j switch to output a parsing intermediate representation that should resemble original USB requests
along with associated metadata.
This can be used in more advanced applications, such as if you need to decode a complicated protocol
or convert USB output to higher level API calls.
An example can be found here: <https://github.com/ProgHQ/bpmicro/blob/master/scrape.py>
This example first aggregates USB packets into application specific packets, and then decodes these into API calls

# USB serial decoder

usbrply-serial supported adapters:

* FT2232C: data rx/tx

# What is Responsible Disclosure?

![](https://www.bugcrowd.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Resource-Tile-What-is-Responsible-Disclosure.jpg)

[Back to resources](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resources/)

Benefit from the knowledge of hackers by providing them transparent rules for submitting vulnerabilities to your team with a responsible disclosure policy. There are three types of disclosure–[discretionary disclosure, coordinated disclosure, and full disclosure](https://www.bugcrowd.com/glossary/vulnerability-disclosure/).

## **WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE?**

Responsible disclosure is a process that allows hackers to safely report found vulnerabilities to your team.

It can be a messy process for hackers to know exactly how to share vulnerabilities in your applications and infrastructure in a safe and efficient manner. Generating a responsible disclosure policy can be confusing and time-consuming, so many organizations do not create one at all.

To help organizations adopt responsible disclosure, we’ve developed an [open-source responsible disclosure policy](https://github.com/bugcrowd/disclosure-policy) your team can utilize for free.

Many organizations choose to implement vulnerability disclosure programs to help with this. By having a dedicated platform to simplify the reporting process, it makes it easier for hackers to submit their findings.

## **FULL DISCLOSURE – WHY IT’S NOT IDEAL**

Occasionally a hacker may discover a flaw in your app. This leaves the hacker responsible for reporting the vulnerability. In most cases, a hacker will privately report the breach to your team and allow your team a reasonable timeframe to fix the issue. In some cases, **they may publicize the exploit to alert directly to the public**.

Disclosing a vulnerability to the public is known as full disclosure, and there are different reasons why a hacker may go about this path. A hacker may disclose a vulnerability if:

* They are unable to get in contact with the company.
* Their vulnerability report was ignored (no reply or unhelpful response).
* Their vulnerability report was not fixed.
* They felt notifying the public would prompt a fix.
* They are afraid of legal prosecution.

While not a common occurrence, full disclosure can put pressure on your development team and PR department, especially if the hacker hasn’t first informed your company. These scenarios can lead to negative press and a scramble to fix the vulnerability.

## **IS FULL DISCLOSURE MORALLY SOUND?**

If a finder has done everything possible to alert an organization of a vulnerability and been unsuccessful, Full Disclosure is the option of last resort. Some security experts believe full disclosure is a proactive security measure. Their argument is that the public scrutiny it generates is the most reliable way to help build security awareness. Others believe it is a careless technique that exposes the flaw to other potential hackers. Regardless of which way you stand, getting hacked is a situation that is worth protecting against.

## **RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE – GETTING STARTED**

A responsible disclosure policy **is the initial first step in helping protect your company** from an attack or premature vulnerability release to the public. The best part is they aren’t hard to set up and provide your team peace of mind when a hacker discovers a vulnerability. Getting started with responsible disclosure simply requires a security page that states:

* What parts or sections of a site are within testing scope.
* The types of bugs and vulnerabilities that are valid for submission.
* A dedicated security email address to report the issue (often security@example.com).

Best practices include stating response times a hacker should expect from the company’s security team, as well as the length of time for the bug to be fixed. If you’d like an example, you can view [Bugcrowd’s Standard Disclosure Policy](https://bugcrowd.com/resources/standard-disclosure-terms), which is utilized by its customers. If you want to get deeper on the subject, we also updated our [Ultimate Guide to Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resources/guide/ultimate-guide-to-vulnerability-disclosure/).

Another reason why this is important is it provides legal protection for hackers. There is a growing focus on ensuring protection for hackers. Some jurisdictions are taking steps to safeguard hackers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities from facing repercussions.

Implementing a responsible disclosure policy will lead to a higher level of security awareness for your team. Bringing the conversation of “what if” to your team will raise security awareness and help minimize the occurrence of an attack.

At Bugcrowd, we’ve run over 495 disclosure and bug bounty programs to provide security peace of mind. Whether you have an existing disclosure program or are considering setting up your own, Bugcrowd provides a responsible disclosure platform that can help streamline submissions and manage your program for you.

# Program Benefits

We work hard to make participating in the ZDI program easy and rewarding for researchers.

Plus, the program only gets more rewarding as your contributions increase.

[VIEW DISCLOSURE POLICY](/advisories/disclosure_policy/)

The amount we offer to a researcher for a particular vulnerability depends on the following criteria:

* Is the affected product widely deployed?
* Can exploiting the flaw lead to a server or client compromise? At what privilege level?
* Is the flaw exposed in default configurations/installations?
* Are the affected products high value (e.g. databases, e-commerce servers, DNS, routers,
  firewalls)?
* Does the vulnerability require a social engineering component? (e.g. clicking a link, visiting a
  site, connecting to a server, etc.)

To determine the worth of a vulnerability, researchers should sign up for an account and submit it for a valuation.
If an offer is not made or an offer is made but not accepted by the researcher, the vulnerability information will
remain the property of the researcher and will not be used in the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program. We reserve the
right to not make an offer to acquire a vulnerability for any or no reason.

The success of the ZDI program depends on developing a mutual trust and loyalty over time with participating
security researchers. To reward repeated patronage of the ZDI, we developed the following incentive programs.

**ZDI Referral Program**

For each new researcher that is referred to the ZDI, the referrer is given 2,500 ZDI Rewards points (see below)
after that referral's first vulnerability is acquired under the ZDI.

**ZDI Rewards Program**

As a member of the ZDI program, you earn points each time a vulnerability submission is purchased. Points are
treated in a manner similar to airline frequent flyer miles - points accrue each year on a dollar-for-dollar basis
based on the total amount paid for vulnerability submissions by the researcher during that calendar year. For
instance, if the Zero Day Initiative buys your vulnerability for $5,000, then you receive 5,000 points for that
submission. For all of this calendar year, if you receive 47,000 points, then for the next calendar year you will be
considered to have ZDI Gold status. To maximize your submission, review the information provided by
[this blog](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2017/9/5/getting-into-submitting-how-to-maximize-your-research).
It offers helpful tips to ensure you get the most from your submission.

Each level offers exclusive awards and benefits, each of which last for the one calendar year period following the
year in which the points were earned:

## PROCESS

##### DISCOVER

A researcher identifies a previously unpatched vulnerability.

##### SUBMIT

The vulnerability is submitted through our secure portal and a case ID is created.

##### VALIDATE

We verify the submission and e-mail an offer to the researcher.

##### REWARD

The researcher accepts the offer, and is paid promptly by check or wire transfer.

##### NOTIFY

We notify the affected vendor before sharing the research with other vendors and the public.

## RESEARCHER REWARDS

As an added perk for researchers, ZDI offers a Researcher Rewards Program which can substantially increase rewards and bonuses for researchers who are especially productive within the program. As a member of the program, you receive one point for every dollar you are paid for your submitted vulnerabilities.

## Premise

### This article describes a vulnerability affecting Wacom Driver [6.3.46-1](https://github.com/LucaBarile/ZDI-CAN-16857/tree/main/WacomTablet_6.3.46-1) and [6.3.45-1](https://github.com/LucaBarile/ZDI-CAN-16318/tree/main/WacomTablet_6.3.45-1) for Windows (it probably affects older versions as well, but I haven't tested them), and a way by which this vulnerability can be exploited to get an arbitrary file write\overwrite primitive (with no control over the content of the file written\overwritten). I suggest to read [this](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html) article to better understand some points of what you’re going to read.

## How did I discover the vulnerability?

### All the previous Wacom Driver vulnerabilities I discovered ([1.1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html), [1.2](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html), [1.3](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html), [2](../ZDI-CAN-16857/index.html) and [3](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html)), were mainly discovered through the dynamic analysis (except [1.1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html), which also required static analysis) of the Wacom Driver components (eg `Wacom_Tablet.exe`, `Remove.exe`, `WTabletServicePro.exe`, ...). I don't have any Wacom device but, one day, I got the chance to use one ([Wacom Intuos Small Graphic Tablet](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos)). Only when a Wacom device is connected to the PC some features of [WacomDesktopCenter.exe](https://101.wacom.com/UserHelp/en/WDC.htm) are enabled, so I took this opportunity to understand what happens (through dynamic analysis) when these features are used and, consequently, to look for some possible vulnerabilities. Unfortunately the analysis of all the unlocked features didn't get me anywhere because they're managed by `WacomDesktopCenter.exe`, which runs and performs its operations with the privileges of the current user. Not knowing what else to analyze, as a last resort, I tried to understand what happens when a Wacom device is plugged\unplugged via USB, and I discovered an unexpected and pleasant surprise 🙃

## Analyzing the Wacom device plugging\unplugging 🔍

### Using [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) I discovered that, when a Wacom device is plugged\unplugged via USB to the PC, `%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\Wacom_Tablet.exe` is triggered and runs under the context of [SYSTEM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account). Once triggered it tries to download the `update.xml` file from a Wacom server (<http://link.wacom.com/wdc/update.xml>) and, if the file get downloaded properly, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` saves it, without [impersonating](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/impersonation) the current user, into the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder. Here's the problem: the `wactemp` folder isn't created during the Wacom Driver installation therefore, the first time a Wacom device will be plugged in, and `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be able to download the `update.xml` file from the Wacom server, the `wactemp` folder will be created (and it will no longer be deleted because it will be used to store the updated versions of the `update.xml` file) and the downloaded `update.xml` file will be saved in it. You can see the creation of the `wactemp` folder and the `update.xml` file in the following image, obtained by analyzing with Process Monitor the first Wacom device plugging event.

![](media/wactemp&update.jpg "The first Wacom device plugging")

### But what if we create a `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` [NTFS volume mount point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_volume_mount_point) before that happens? We can do it because the regular user has [special access](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par6) to the `%windir%\Temp` folder... Notes: * `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `wactemp` folder only once because it will no longer be deleted after the first creation. * When `Wacom_Tablet.exe` saves the downloaded `update.xml` file into the `wactemp` folder, if an older version of the `update.xml` is already present, it will be overwritten by the new one. * If the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point isn't created before `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder, it will no longer be possible to create it, because the regular user cannot delete the folders\files stored in the `%windir%\Temp` folder. * If the PC isn't connected to the Internet, or the `update.xml` file download process fails for some reason, the `wactemp` folder and the `update.xml` file will not be created. * `Wacom_Tablet.exe` tries to repeat the `update.xml` file download and save procedure even during the Wacom device unplugging event. * As the name itself says, the `update.xml` file is necessary to understand if an update of the Wacom Driver (or some of its components related to the Wacom device used by the user) is available, and if the update is supported by the current version of the operating system. In case `update.xml` is no longer available on the [Wacom server](http://link.wacom.com/wdc/update.xml) and you want to analyze it, I saved a copy [here](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/blob/main/Files/update.xml) (downloaded on 2022-08-27). * I suppose `Wacom_Tablet.exe` repeats the `update.xml` file download and save procedure every time a Wacom device is plugged\unplugged to the PC because it wants to check if there are updates for that particular device and, the data of a Wacom device, is collected at the time of its plugging\unplugging. An alternative could be to store only the data of the new connected Wacom devices and search for updates only once a day (or at regular time intervals), without depending on the connection of a device. Could it work? 🤔

## An Arbitrary File Write\Overwrite primitive 📝

### Probably, if you have read these four articles ([1](../ZDI-CAN-16857/index.html), [2](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html), [3](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html) and [4](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html)), by now you will have understood that when the situation just described occurs, the [link following attack](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html) is the first thing that comes to mind and, even in this case, it can be applied in a similar way to what has been done [here](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par4) and [here](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par6). We can create a `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` [NTFS volume mount point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_volume_mount_point) to [\RPC Control](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/08/windows-exploitation-tricks-exploiting.html) before `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder. Then we can create a [Symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) from `\RPC Control\update.xml` to a file we want to write\overwrite (in my POC I used `%windir%\win.ini`). Now the workflow is quite simple: when the user plugs in a Wacom device, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be triggered, download the `update.xml` file from the Wacom server (if the PC is connected to the Internet), create the `wactemp` folder (if it hasn't already been created) and save the downloaded `update.xml` file in it. However, since we've created the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point, when `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will try to save the `update.xml` file into `%windir%\Temp\wactemp`, it will consider our mount point as a valid `wactemp` folder and try to write the downloaded `update.xml` file in it. Since `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` is a mount point to `\RPC Control`, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected (reparsed) and will try to write `\RPC Control\update.xml`. Since `\RPC Control\update.xml` is a symbolic link to our target file (eg `%windir%\win.ini`), `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected again, and will write\overwrite the target file (and it will succeed because it's running under the context of `SYSTEM`) with the content of the downloaded `update.xml`. If the target file doesn't exist, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will create it and write the content of the downloaded `update.xml` in it, otherwise it will overwrite the contents of the already existing file with the content of the downloaded `update.xml`. In the following image you can see `Wacom_Tablet.exe` reparsed to the target file after creating the `wactemp` mountpoint and plugging, for the first time, a Wacom device.

## The Exploit ☠️

### The exploit that I wrote is based on the aforementioned workflow and performs the following steps: 1. Ask the user which file he wants to write\overwrite (let's suppose `%windir%\win.ini`). 2. Create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point to `\RPC Control`. 3. Create the `\RPC Control\update.xml` symbolic link to `%windir%\win.ini`. 4. When the user plugs in a Wacom device, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` is triggered (and runs under the context of `SYSTEM`). 5. `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will download the `update.xml` file from a Wacom server and try to save it into the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder. 6. Since `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` is a mount point to `\RPC Control`, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected and will try to write `\RPC Control\update.xml`. 7. Since `\RPC Control\update.xml` is a symbolic link to `%windir%\win.ini`, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected again, and will overwrite `%windir%\win.ini` with the content of the downloaded `update.xml`. [Here](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Exploit/Exploit.bat) you can find my exploit. If your operating system is not installed on the C drive, modify the exploit by replacing `CreateMountPoint.exe "C:\Windows\Temp\wactemp" "\RPC Control"` with `CreateMountPoint.exe "%windir%\Temp\wactemp" "\RPC Control"`. `CreateMountPoint.exe` and `CreateSymlink.exe` are programs developed by [James Forshaw](https://twitter.com/tiraniddo) and are downloadable from his [symboliclink-testing-tools](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools) repository, respectively [here](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools/tree/main/CreateMountPoint) and [here](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools/tree/main/CreateSymlink).

## POC 🎦

### I've tested the exploit only on Wacom Driver 6.3.46-1 but, most likely, it also works for the previous versions (and I hope not on the future ones 🙄). The Wacom device I plugged in to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` is Wacom Intuos Small Graphic Tablet, but any Wacom device should be fine.

![](media/POC.gif "Exploitation Proof Of Concept")

## Constraints & workarounds ⛔↪️

### To successfully exploit the arbitrary file write vulnerability we must face the following constraints: 1. We must create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point before `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder (otherwise we'll not be able to create the mount point). 2. The PC must be connected to the Internet (otherwise `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will not be able to download the `update.xml` file). 3. We ~~must~~ have a Wacom device (otherwise we won't be able to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe`). To face the previous constraints, I came up with the following workarounds: 1. We've two possibilities: 1. The system administrator installs the Wacom Driver and we've the possibility to log into our account before he connects a Wacom device. In this case `Wacom_Tablet.exe` has never been triggered and, consequently, the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder has not been created yet. 2. We create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point before the system administrator installs the Wacom Driver. We don't know if the system administrator will install it but, if he does, we'll be able to exploit the vulnerability even if he will connect a Wacom device before we can log into our account. 2. If the PC can be connected to the Internet the problem doesn't arise, otherwise we've two possibilities: 1. If the PC can use a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection, we can use our mobile phone as an Internet hotspot. 2. If the PC has no connections, we can use a [mobile broadband modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_broadband_modem) or, more simply, we can connect a [wireless USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_USB) (in this second case, we're in the same situation described in the previous point, so we can use our mobile phone as an Internet hotspot). 3. This last problem is quite difficult to solve (for me, of course 😢); in the next paragraph I propose the only possible workaround I found.

## Wacom USB device plugging\unplugging simulation 🔌

### Is it possible to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` without plugging or unplugging a Wacom device? I analyzed several executable files (which are installed during the installation of the Wacom Driver) through static analysis to look for some interesting parameters that could be used to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe`, forcing it to download the `update.xml` file, but I didn't find anything interesting. I tried to emulate a Wacom device on Windows but, the only emulators I found were those of Wacom PenPartner tablet (already included in [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU)), and [those](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-qemu) developed by [Nicholas Sherlock](https://www.nicksherlock.com/) (for Wacom Bamboo and Wacom Intuos 5 graphics tablet), which can be added to [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/). Unfortunately all three emulators are designed to run on QEMU, and my goal is to emulate a Wacom device on Windows, not on a Windows virtual machine running within QEMU. At this point, the only plausible way I’ve found to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` without plugging or unplugging a Wacom device, is to simulate (through a software) the Wacom USB device plugging (or unplugging) event. Searching the net I found out that other people also needed, for different reasons, to simulate the USB plugging event of a particular device (as you can read [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1452768/record-usb-input-and-emulate-it-later) and [here](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/simulate-a-device-being-plugged-into-windows-10/609881/16)). In [this](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/simulate-a-device-being-plugged-into-windows-10/609881/16) forum [zwieblum](https://forum.arduino.cc/u/zwieblum) proposes an interesting way to simulate the plugging event of a general USB device, which consists in taking a dump (the packets that are exchanged) of the initial USB device communication, and reproducing it when you want to simulate the USB device plugging. To take a dump of the initial USB device communication on Windows, we can use the [USBPcap](https://desowin.org/usbpcap/) feature on [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (read [this](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB#windows) article and watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvh5tqsVjf0&ab_channel=SKSolutions) video for more details). To replay the captured packets back using a software (without any physical device flashing or other ways that require a physical device) it's not that simple, but [usbrply](https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply) is the software that's right for us. It has been developed by [John Mcmaster](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster), and allows you to convert a [.pcap](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/pcap) file (captured USB packets) to Python or C code that replays the captured USB commands. In our case we are interested in capturing only the first packets, which are exchanged in the first seconds in which the Wacom device is plugged-in and correctly recognized (or those exchanged at the moment of the device unplugging), to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe`. I captured twice [the packets exchanged upon plugging](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Files/Plugging) and five times [those exchanged upon unplugging](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Files/Unplugging). I configured usbrply as indicated [here](https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply#sample-workflows) (with `VID = 0x056A` and `PID = 0x0376` (taken from the string `USB\VID_056A&PID_0376` (read [this](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/blob/main/Files/vendor_and_device_ID.txt) file to figure out how to get that string))) and tried to reproduce the captured packets back. For some reason all the attempts to reproduce the captured packets back have failed, for both types of packages (those that should have simulated the device plugging and those that should have simulated its unplugging). I reached out to Nicholas Sherlock to ask him for help and some possible solution but, at the moment, no solution has been found. However, I think this is the right way to simulate a Wacom device plugging\unplugging event to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` without connecting any real device but, at the moment, I don't have the time to understand where the catch is. I'd like to go back to investigate this question in the future and, if in the meantime you find the catch (or an alternative solution), send me a mail at *luca.barile.research@gmail.com*; I'll update this paragraph by adding your solution 😉

## From Arbitrary File Write\Overwrite to Windows Denial of Service 🪟❌

### Another idea would be to use our Arbitrary File Write\Overwrite primitive for a permanent Windows Denial of Service attack. If we want to deny the user to use the Windows OS (preventing it from booting properly), we could think to delete a file (or more files) necessary for its booting, like I did [here](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html#par8). Curiously though, searching a bit on the net I ended up on [this](https://labs.redyops.com/index.php/2020/04/27/dos-via-arbitrary-folder-creation/) page, which made me discover a different way (to create the `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` file (or folder)) to prevent Windows from booting and bring up the famous [BSoD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death). This may seem quite counterintuitive because it seems much more reasonable to delete some files needed to start the operating system to prevent Windows from booting, rather than creating a file (or a folder), even empty... Yet, as you can see in the PoC below, this technique works properly!

![](media/BSoD.gif "cng.sys (file or folder) causes the Windows BSoD")

### So, if we want to use the exploit shown in the [previous POC](#par6) to get a persistent Windows Denial of Service, all we have to do is enter `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` when we're asked which file we want to overwrite. Since `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` doesn't exist in standard Windows installations, it will be created and, the next time Windows starts, the BSoD will be displayed (and the auto-repair Windows procedure won't be able to fix the problem).

## Something more on cng.sys 🔐

### What is `cng.sys`? What is it for? Why does its creation prevent Windows from booting? From the [.sys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.sys) filename extension we can deduce that it's a system file, so it probably contains device drivers or hardware configurations for the system. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/about-cng) Microsoft confirms that it's a driver and, in particular, it's the Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) kernel driver. The CNG API is the successor of [CryptoAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_CryptoAPI) (which is now deprecated), and consists of [several primitives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cryptographic-primitives) that provides a set of functions useful for basic cryptographic operations. These cryptographic operations are used by many programs to protect the user's privacy and keep its data confidential. When Windows is installed (in my case I'm referring to Windows 10, but this probably also applies to other Windows versions), the `cng.sys` file doesn't exist in the `%windir%\system32` folder, because it's installed into `%windir%\system32\drivers` folder, and only [TrustedInstaller](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-trustedinstaller-and-why-does-it-keep-me-from-renaming-files/) has full access on it. Since, for the reasons just described, `cng.sys` is a very important Windows kernel driver, the operating system loads it from `%windir%\system32\drivers` at startup but, if another `cng.sys` file (or folder) exists in the `%windir%\system32` folder, Windows loads it as well! If the `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` is a fake file (or a folder), the operating system crashes during its loading, bringing up the BSoD. This probably happens because of a wrong file search order; Windows looks for the `cng.sys` file first in the `%windir%\system32` folder and then in the `%windir%\system32\drivers` (or it follows another order but, at some point, it tries to load the `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` file anyway). I don't know why Windows doesn't load `cng.sys` only from the right folder. Can it be because in previous versions of Windows it was located in `%windir%\system32`, and then it was moved to `%windir%\system32\drivers` but the developers forgot to update its folders search order? Probably other Windows drivers can be exploited to get a BSoD as well. Do you know another one? Send me a mail at *luca.barile.research@gmail.com*; I'll update this paragraph by adding a list of drivers affected by the same problem 📋 PS Just to stay on topic... Did you know that a Security Feature Bypass vulnerability was found in `cng.sys`? Take a look at [CVE-2018-0902](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-0902/) for more details.

## How to fix the vulnerability 🚑

### There are several solutions: * Create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder directly during the Wacom Driver installation process, so that the user can't create a mount point in its place. With this solution the user could still create files inside the folder, which could interfere in some way with the Wacom Drivers activities, so I don't think this is the best solution. * Force `Wacom_Tablet.exe` to impersonate the user while creating the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp\update.xml` file. By doing this, the link following attack will fail because when `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected, it will only be able to write\overwrite files that the user can already write\overwrite on his own. * Create the `wactemp` folder under `%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\` (where the user doesn't have write access). * Check that `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` isn't a symbolic link before creating the `update.xml` file in it. With this solution we've the same problem described in the first point. * Change the update process logic, checking for updates directly by querying a Wacom server, without downloading any files to a temporary folder.

## Vulnerability disclosure timeline 📅

### First of all, I checked if the vendor has launched a bug bounty program but, unfortunately, Wacom Technology Corporation has none and the only page where you can report something ([this](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)), doesn't speak explicitly of any acknowledgement (neither meritocratically nor economically). At this point I followed the MITRE [researcher reservation guidelines](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines) and, since Wacom Technology Corporation isn't on the [CNAs partner list](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners), the only two remaining possibilities were to contact the CNA of Last Resort ([CNA-LR](https://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html#cna-lr)) through the [CVE Request web form](https://cveform.mitre.org/) or a [third-party coordinator CNAs](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines#process#4) (read [this](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/a-simple-guide-to-getting-cves-published/) interesting article for more information on how to get a CVE published). Since the CNA of Last Resort, as the word itself says, is the last resort (🏝️), I looked for a third-party CNA in the CNAs list and decided to contact the [Zero Day Initiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/) CNA. ZDI relieves you from the burden of tracking the bug with the vendor, could make a monetary offer to the researcher (CNA of Last Resort doesn't), follows a [responsible vulnerability disclosure](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/) policy and has a [loyalty program](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/) (CNA of Last Resort doesn't). You can learn more about their disclosure policy [here](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/). * 2022-07-30 (GMT+1) - I discovered the vulnerability. * 2022-08-27 (GMT-6) - I reported the vulnerability to ZDI (CASE OPENED). * 2022-08-29 (GMT-6) - ZDI assigned the case (CASE ASSIGNED). * 2022-09-30 (GMT+1) - I asked ZDI for an update. * 2022-09-30 (GMT+1) - ZDI replied that they're currently experiencing high case volumes so I can expect several weeks for reply. * 2022-10-04 (GMT-6) - ZDI investigated the case (CASE INVESTIGATED). * 2022-10-12 (GMT+1) - ZDI replied that they aren't interested in this vulnerability because it requires a Wacom device for testing (CASE CLOSED) 🤔 At this point the only alternative left is the CNA of Last Resort (CNA-LR), so I decided to use the CVE Request web form to report the vulnerability. * 2022-10-12 (GMT+1) - I submitted the vulnerability to CNA-LR. * 2022-10-12 (GMT+1) - CNA-LR assigned the ID 1344351 to my request. * 2022-11-14 (GMT+1) - CNA-LR reserved the [CVE-2022-43293](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43293) ID for my vulnerability. * 2022-12-15 (GMT+1) - I asked to CNA-LR for an update (no answare...). * 2023-01-22 (GMT+1) - I asked to CNA-LR again for an update (no answare...). * 2023-02-22 (GMT+1) - I asked to CNA-LR again for an update (no answare...). * 2023-04-07 (GMT+1) - I decided to make the [exploit](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Exploit/) for this vulnerability (and related report) public on my GitHub [page](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293) and informed MITRE through CNA-LR.

## Final considerations

### The references that have been useful to me to write this article and the exploit code are already present, in the form of links, in the previous paragraphs you have read and that make up this article. The conclusions are very similar to those that I wrote in some of my previous articles ([1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html), [1.1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html), [1.2](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html) and [2](../ZDI-CAN-16857/index.html)) and concern the logical vulnerabilities and the link following attack technique. The vulnerability I described in this article is just another example of a logical vulnerability discovered through dynamic analysis using Process Monitor and, if you've read my previous articles related to logical vulnerabilities, I think that the paragraphs that might be most interesting for you are the following three: [1](#par8), [2](#par9) and [3](#par10). In this particular scenario a device is needed to trigger the vulnerability, and find a software technique that allows the exploit to simulate its interactions (at least those necessary to trigger the vulnerability (e.g. device plugging\unplugging)), would make its presence unnecessary, and wouldn't require particular operations by the user during the exploit execution (he just has to enter the path of the file to write\overwrite). More generally, all the exploits related to vulnerabilities that fall under this scenario would be device-independent and, therefore, more powerful. For this reason, I suggest you deepen this "software technique", and I think [this](#par8) is a good starting point.

# Emulated Wacom tablets for QEMU

These devices simulate the basic functionality of a Wacom Bamboo or Wacom Intuos 5 graphics tablet
in QEMU. I have built this as an alternative to the support that QEMU already has for simulating a Wacom "PenPartner"
tablet, because this tablet model is positively ancient and isn't well-supported by guest drivers anymore.

The goal of this project is to allow me to test out official Wacom drivers (macOS / Windows) for tablets that I don't
actually own, for my [Wacom Driver Fix](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-driver-fix) project that fixes bugs in
Wacom's abandoned macOS drivers.

The Intuos 5 model emulates an Intuos 5 Touch Medium PTH-650 (but with no touch support). The Bamboo tablet is a Bamboo
Pen CTL-460.

The emulated devices work on Linux (with `input-wacom`), Windows 10 and macOS Catalina (both using Wacom's official drivers).

There's probably nobody else in the world who will find this useful, but I'm posting it here just in case.

## Adding this to QEMU

Add the two drivers `dev-wacom-bamboo.c` and `dev-wacom-intuos-5.c` into QEMU's sourcecode at `/hw/usb`, alongside the
`dev-wacom.c` driver that is already included with QEMU. Then edit `meson.build` in that same directory to add the new
drivers to the list of object files:

Before:

```
softmmu_ss.add(when: 'CONFIG_USB_TABLET_WACOM', if_true: files('dev-wacom.c'))

```

After:

```
softmmu_ss.add(when: 'CONFIG_USB_TABLET_WACOM', if_true: files('dev-wacom.c', 'dev-wacom-bamboo.c', 'dev-wacom-intuos-5.c'))
```

Then build QEMU from source.

## Using the new tablet devices

You can attach one of the new tablets to your VM the same way as with the built-in `usb-wacom` device. The new tablets are named
`usb-wacom-tablet-intuos-5` and `usb-wacom-tablet-bamboo`, e.g.:

```
qemu -device usb-wacom-tablet-intuos-5,id=wacom

```

I've dropped support for the tablet's fallback HID Mouse mode, which is normally used when no Wacom tablet drivers
are loaded in the guest. Instead, QEMU will send your mouse events to its next input driver in the stack (likely the PS/2
tablet device) until the guest's Wacom driver is loaded.

(You can tell if you're using the proper Wacom device rather than the PS/2 fallback, because your scrollwheel will stop
functioning, since I didn't add support for it)

You can override the vendorid and productid of the device like so (but the tablet may not provide the features that are
expected of it by the guest's drivers, and fail to operate):

```
qemu -device usb-wacom-tablet-bamboo,id=wacom,vendorid=0x056a,productid=0x0069

```

When the cursor is idle for 3 seconds, the virtual tablet will simulate the pen leaving proximity, then it'll simulate
a re-enter the next time the cursor moves.

Your scrollwheel controls the simulated pen pressure, but it seems like you can't change the pressure while the pen is
held down, maybe a QEMU quirk.

# usbrply

Convert a .pcap file (captured USB packets) to Python or C code that replays the captured USB commands.

Supported packet sources are:

* Linux Wireshark (via usbmon)
* Windows Wireshark (via USBPcap)

Supported output formats are:

* libusb Python (primary)
* (libusb C: fixme)
* (Linux Kernel C: fixme)
* JSON

Example applications:

* Rapidly reverse engineer and re-implement USB protocols
* Record a proprietary Windows programming sequence and replay on an embedded Linux device
* Snoop USB-serial packets

Questions? Please reach out on github or join #usbrply on Freenode IRC

# Linux installation

```
# Do one of these
# Easier to setup, but slower
sudo pip install python-pcapng
# Much faster, but no longer maintained
sudo apt-get install -y python-libpcap
git clone https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply.git
cd usbrply
sudo python setup.py install

```

# Windows installation

There is probably an easier way to do this but this is what I got to work. Tested on Windows 7 x64

Setup python and pip

* Get the latest Python 3 release (<https://www.python.org/downloads/>)
* I used Python 3.7.8 (Windows x86-64 executable installer)
* Keep default setup options (in particular this will install pip)

Install libusb1

* pip install libusb1

Install usb drivers

* Some USB drivers won't replay. You need to switch their USB drivers to WinUSB. You can use Zadig to switch between USB libraries for a single device.
* <https://zadig.akeo.ie/>
* Run Zadig
* Click on **Options** then **List all devices** then select the USB device that doesn't replay properly and **Replace Driver** with WinUSB

Install

* Open a command prompt
  + Default should be your home dir (ex: C:\Users\mcmaster)
* `python -m venv usbrply`
* `usbrply\Scripts\activate.bat`
* `pip install usbrply`

Test

* If not still in venv (prompt like "(usbrply)" ): `usbrply/Scripts/activate.bat`
* `python usbrply\Scripts\usbrply -h`
  + You should get a help message
* Download and place in your home dir: <https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply-test/raw/master/win1.pcapng>
* `python usbply\Scripts\usbrply win1.pcapng`
  + You should see python code that will reproduce the .pcap file commands

# Sample workflows

## Capturing Windows traffic and replaying traffic in Python:

* Install Wireshark. Make sure you install the USBPcap library
* Start Wireshark
* Connect USB device to computer
* Select which USB device you want to capture by clicking on the tiny blue cogwheel and checking the box next to the USB device you want to capture [![usbPcap](/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply/raw/master/docs/usbPcap.png)](/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply/blob/master/docs/usbPcap.png)
* Double click on the USBPcap to start the capture
* Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Close application
* Stop capture
* Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
* Close Wireshark
* Run: `usbrply --wrapper --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py`
* Assuming your usb device is connected to the computer, go to "Device manager", find your device, right click on it, select "Properties", go to "Details" tab, select "Hardware IDs" from the drop-down, and you will find an entry of a form: HID\VID\_046D&PID\_C05A For this example the vid is 0x046D and the pid is 0xC05A
* Scroll down to the bottom of replay.py and edit the following line:

```
        if (vid, pid) == (**0x0000**, **0x0000**):

```

* Example edited line:

```
        if (vid, pid) == (**0x046D**, **0xC05A**):

```

* Linux: run `python replay.py`
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

## Capturing Windows VM traffic from Linux host and replaying traffic in Python:

Example: program a Xilinx dev board under Linux without knowing anything about the JTAG adapter USB protocol

* On Linux host:
  + Install Wireshark
  + Enable usbmon so Wireshark can capture USB (e.g. `sudo modprobe usbmon`, see <http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB>)
  + Boot Windows VM (ie through VMWare)
  + Start Wireshark. Make sure you have USB permissions (ie you may need to sudo)
  + Connect USB device to computer
  + Use lsusb to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
  + Start catpure on bus from above
  + Attach USB device to Windows guest
* On Windows guest:
  + Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Back on Linux host:
  + Stop capture in Wireshark.
  + Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
  + Run: `usbrply --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py`
  + Detatch USB device from Windows guest
  + Run `python replay.py`
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

## Capturing from Linux Terminal

* Install tshark
* Enable usbmon so tshark can capture USB (e.g. `sudo modprobe usbmon`, see <http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB>)
* Connect USB device to computer
* Use `lsusb` to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
* Start capturing using tshark like: `tshark -i usbmon1 -w capture.pcapng`
  + The usbmon device matches the bus number output from `lsusb` e.g. a device entry starting with `Bus 001 Device 002` would be captured from `usbmon1`.
* Use the device as desired.
* Stop capturing by hitting Ctrl-C.
* Run: `usbrply --device-hi -p capture.pcapng > replay.py`

# Command Line Options

You may need to filter out USB devices. There are two ways to do this:

* `--device-hi`: use the last device enumerated. This works well in most cases, including FX2 renumeration
* `--device DEVICE`: manually specify the USB device used. Get this from lsusb output or Wireshark view

Other useful switches:

* `--rel-pkt`: intended to easier allow diffing two outputs. Ex: what changed in trace for LED on vs LED off?
* `--no-packet-numbers`: alternative to above
* `--fx2`: decode common FX2 commands (ex: CPU reset)
* `--range RANGE`: only decode a specific packet range. Use along with Wireshark GUI or refine a previous decode
* see `--help` for more

# JSON output

use -j switch to output a parsing intermediate representation that should resemble original USB requests
along with associated metadata.
This can be used in more advanced applications, such as if you need to decode a complicated protocol
or convert USB output to higher level API calls.
An example can be found here: <https://github.com/ProgHQ/bpmicro/blob/master/scrape.py>
This example first aggregates USB packets into application specific packets, and then decodes these into API calls

# USB serial decoder

usbrply-serial supported adapters:

* FT2232C: data rx/tx

#### Vulnerability Information

Vulnerability Type

CWE-ID

Definition

Buffer Overflow

[CWE-119](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

[CWE-79](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

SQL Injection

[CWE-89](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)

The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

Directory Traversal

[CWE-22](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

XML External Entity (XXE)

[CWE-611](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

Insecure Permissions

[CWE-276](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/276.html)

The software, upon installation, sets incorrect permissions for an object that exposes it to an unintended actor.

Incorrect Access Control

[CWE-284](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/284.html)

The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.

Integer Overflow

[CWE-190](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

[CWE-352](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)

The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

Missing SSL certification verification

[CWE-599](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/599.html)

The software uses OpenSSL and trusts or uses a certificate without using the SSL\_get\_verify\_result() function to ensure that the certificate satisfies all necessary security requirements.

Other or Unknown

N/A

The software contains a mistake other than above which can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network.

March 14, 2022

4 Minute Read
by Adeeb Shah Bobby Cooke

We were once newcomers to the security research field and one of the most annoying problems we ran across was how to get a CVE published. After all, what good is it to find a juicy vulnerability if you can’t get the word out to others? So, as a resource to help our fellow researchers, we decided to put together a CVE publishing guide based on our experience, and honestly a lot of good old trial and error. This guide will, hopefully, let you skip the headaches and guesswork that we endured learning this process when you try to get a CVE published.

### Step 1: Making Sure the Vulnerability is New

Congrats! After much hard work, you found a 0-day! Now, before you do anything, make sure that the vulnerability hasn’t been spotted and reported by anyone else. To do this you absolutely need to check the [MITRE database.](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/) it is also advisable to explore whether the vulnerability was previously discovered through searches on Google, Github, ExploitDB, PacketStorm, and other exploit repositories on the Internet.

### Step 2: Contacting the Product Owner

Since your vulnerability is new, your next step is to attempt to contact the vendor/product owner and responsibly disclose the issue. At this point, one of two things will take place. Either the vendor/product owner will respond and work with you to resolve the issue or you will hear nothing but crickets in response to your attempts to communicate.

Here’s the important part, make sure you take screenshots, save all emails associated with this project and do everything you can to document that you attempted to contact the application owner. Note the date on your calendar since this is when the clock starts ticking. Use every possible (feasible) method you can leverage to contact the vendor, including e-mail, phone, and/or platform messaging. Tagging the company on social media sites and asking to be put in touch with someone on their security team is also a great way to get in touch with the appropriate security team.

### Step 3: Coordinating With a Responsive Vendor

Now, let’s assume the vendor quickly responded to your notification, wants to work on mitigating the vulnerability and issue a patch. The key here is to aim for coordinated disclosure.

In an ideal situation, you will release the vulnerability details after the vendor has released a patch. [MITRE has some documentation on how to progress your CVE to disclosure](https://cve.mitre.org/CVEIDsAndHowToGetThem.pdf) that is very helpful to use when working with a cooperative vendor. Ensure that you and the vendor agree on what is being disclosed and how. This will vary between vendors and also based on the CVE in question.

### Step 4: The Sound of Silence

For many reasons, sometimes a vendor will ghost you. If this is the case (and it frequently is) this is what we’ve found to be the best approach:

Disclosure is a gray area with no defined rules, but most researchers wait for 30, 60, 90, or even up to 120 days after notifying or attempting to notify the vendor before publicly disclosing the vulnerability. While you are waiting, go to the MITRE website and fill out the CVE request form. This process is going to be done on a case-by-case basis (ex. if the company/owner is a CVE Numbering Authority, also known as a CNA).

If you don’t see the vendor in the CNA list, fill out the form found [here](https://cveform.mitre.org/). From personal experience, the process to get the CVE entry accepted has taken roughly 30 days on average, so we like to submit this once we find the vulnerability. Once you get a CVE ID (they will notify you by email), you’ll notice that it’s in a RESERVED state. This means that your CVE has been accepted by MITRE but not yet published. This is MITRE acknowledging that you have something valid and a CVE number is assigned to it, but they are awaiting disclosure.

### The Downside of Disclosure

While finding and revealing vulnerabilities is extremely beneficial to the industry, there are a few points to keep in mind. Once a vulnerability is disclosed, threat actors are likely to act upon the issue, so it is imperative that you do not publish without taking every opportunity to contact the vendor and follow responsible disclosure protocols. If you are involved with a bug bounty program operated by the vendor operates then, unfortunately, their disclosure policies may prevent you from disclosing your finding.

### Step 6: The Wait

Now while you’re waiting to hear back from MITRE, it’s generally a good idea to keep trying to contact the application owner/developer at least every 30 days. Once you have waited the length of time you are comfortable with, or to whatever time frame the application owner and you agreed upon, it’s time to publish!

This is the best way that we have found to accomplish publishing your discovery:

* Send POC/exploit to PacketStorm Security/CX Security. A good format for the header is what Exploit-DB shows [here](https://www.exploit-db.com/submit). Make sure that you include the RESERVED CVE-ID that you got from MITRE when you submit to these two websites.
* Once the exploits are published, send the links to MITRE by replying to the email that they sent you with a link to the published POC/Exploit.
* MITRE typically has a quick turnaround for this (one day or so). Sometimes it will email you with an update, sometimes the organization does not. The best thing to do is to check the original CVE link that you were sent and see if it changes from RESERVED and shows the details of the CVE.
* Congrats! You have a published CVE!
* Optional: You can try to send your exploit/POC to exploit-db. They typically won’t respond with an update on whether they decide to publish or not, but if not, try and try again!

### Bonus Pro Tip

A number of our fellow researchers had some issues with responsiveness from MITRE and gave us some advice to share:

*If MITRE doesn’t respond to your email after months, it’s enough to open a new request not as a “CVE Request” but as “other”, specifying you are waiting for such a long time… after doing this, they should reply to you after 24 hours with CVE IDs.*

Happy Hunting!

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

## [Emulating MIPS guests in Proxmox 8](https://www.nicksherlock.com/2024/09/emulating-mips-guests-in-proxmox-8/)

I wanted to emulate MIPS guests on my Proxmox hypervisor so that I could do some security research on router firmware. Unfortunately, Proxmox has customised some of the QEMU packages and their dependencies, which makes it impossible to install the standard Debian `qemu-system-mips` package.

To solve this, we need to build a modified version of Proxmox’s QEMU package from source.

## [Reverse-engineering lens mounts for 3D printing](https://www.nicksherlock.com/2024/01/reverse-engineering-lens-mounts-for-3d-printing/)

So you want to 3D-print a camera accessory like a lens adapter, extension tube, or a custom lens? You’ll need a lens mount design to go along with that!

We’ll clone the required dimensions from the mount found on a lens (for ‘male’ mounts) or camera (for ‘female’ mounts). One way to get an example of both the male and female mount at the same time is to buy an extension tube for your desired mount, e.g. I’ve found the ones from Meike to be good. Avoid tubes with plastic mounts as these are less accurate and may have draft angles that make them difficult to measure. Get a tube that has electronic contacts (for autofocus) so that you can use the dimensions of those as a reference as well.

You’ll need a pair of calipers for measuring the lens dimensions.

For this example I’ll show the process of modelling a Sony A lens’s ‘male’ mount using Fusion 360.

Start by taking a reference photo of your lens mount. Be sure to align your photo straight-on with the mount so that the image isn’t skewed. If you can stand far away from the mount and zoom in when you take the photo this gets you closer to an “orthographic perspective”*,* which means that features won’t appear to erroneously grow larger when they’re closer to your camera.

Here’s my shot:

If you’re using OCLP (OpenCore Legacy Patcher) on an old Mac in order to upgrade beyond the officially-supported macOS version to macOS Monterey instead, Xcode 13.2.1 will crash on launch with the error “The application “Xcode” can’t be opened, 6″. The crash report gives this cause:

## [Installing macOS 13 Ventura on Proxmox 7.2](https://www.nicksherlock.com/2022/10/installing-macos-13-ventura-on-proxmox/)

This tutorial for installing macOS 13 Ventura has been adapted for Proxmox from [Kholia’s OSX-KVM project](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM) and [Leoyzen’s OpenCore configuration for KVM](https://github.com/Leoyzen/KVM-Opencore). You can get the full sourcecode of my OpenCore release [on my GitHub here](https://github.com/thenickdude/KVM-Opencore).

## Requirements

I’ll assume you already have [Proxmox 7.2](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) installed. You also need a real Mac available in order to fetch the OSK key.

Ventura now requires that your CPU has support for **AVX2**, so for Intel your CPU would have to be **at least as new as Haswell**. However, I have added the [CryptexFixup kext](https://github.com/acidanthera/CryptexFixup) to work around this restriction and allow Ventura to be used even on CPUs that don’t have AVX2 support (and merely support SSE 4.2 and AVX1). Note that the AMD graphics card drivers won’t work in this situation, and other apps that assume AVX2 is present could break too! Please see the [CryptexFixup readme](https://github.com/acidanthera/CryptexFixup) for details.

Modern AMD CPUs also support AVX2 and should work with this guide.

## [Installing macOS 13 Ventura Developer Beta on Proxmox 7.2](https://www.nicksherlock.com/2022/06/installing-macos-13-ventura-developer-beta-on-proxmox-7-2/)

> With the public release of macOS 13 Final, this beta guide is now obsolete, [please see the new guide here instead](https://www.nicksherlock.com/2022/10/installing-macos-13-ventura-on-proxmox/)

This tutorial for installing macOS 13 Ventura has been adapted for Proxmox from [Kholia’s OSX-KVM project](https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM) and [Leoyzen’s OpenCore configuration for KVM](https://github.com/Leoyzen/KVM-Opencore). You can get the full sourcecode of my OpenCore release [on my GitHub here](https://github.com/thenickdude/KVM-Opencore).

## Requirements

**Since Ventura is still in closed Developer Beta, you need to be an Apple Developer and have access to a Mac (or Mac VM) to download it.**

I’ll assume you already have [Proxmox 7.2](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) installed. You also need a real Mac available in order to build the installer and fetch the OSK key.

Your Proxmox host computer’s CPU must support **AVX2** (a new restriction in Ventura), so for Intel your CPU must be **at least as new as Haswell**. Older CPUs will panic and reboot while trying to boot the installer.

Modern AMD CPUs also support AVX2 and should work with this guide.

Since Ventura is still in Beta and support for it is preliminary in OpenCore, don’t expect full functionality (Beta software makes for a poor daily-driver).

Regular fans for 3D printers have just two wires, power and ground, and we vary the average supply voltage to the fan using PWM to change its speed.

However 4-wire computer fans like Noctuas are different, these fans expect a steady 12V power supply and a separate 5V PWM signal to set their speed. Check the pinout of your fan’s connector here:

## [Recovering lost GPG public keys from your YubiKey](https://www.nicksherlock.com/2021/08/recovering-lost-gpg-public-keys-from-your-yubikey/)

Have you ever generated GPG keys, loaded them into your YubiKey, and then thrown away/erased your computer? You’ll discover that when you take your YubiKey to a new computer, GPG refuses to automatically import your key when running `--card-status`.

The common wisdom on the Internet is that this is because YubiKeys (and Smart Cards in general) don’t store your public keys at all, they only store your private keys, so you must import your public keys from a backup or a public keyserver instead. If you don’t have such a backup, you’re screwed.

However, I investigated this and found that this common wisdom wasn’t true. I was able to **recover my public keys from my YubiKey 4 even on a brand new, erased computer**. Here’s how you can, too.

## Premise

### This article describes a vulnerability affecting Wacom Driver [6.3.46-1](https://github.com/LucaBarile/ZDI-CAN-16857/tree/main/WacomTablet_6.3.46-1) and [6.3.45-1](https://github.com/LucaBarile/ZDI-CAN-16318/tree/main/WacomTablet_6.3.45-1) for Windows (it probably affects older versions as well, but I haven't tested them), and a way by which this vulnerability can be exploited to get an arbitrary file write\overwrite primitive (with no control over the content of the file written\overwritten). I suggest to read [this](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html) article to better understand some points of what you’re going to read.

## How did I discover the vulnerability?

### All the previous Wacom Driver vulnerabilities I discovered ([1.1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html), [1.2](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html), [1.3](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html), [2](../ZDI-CAN-16857/index.html) and [3](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html)), were mainly discovered through the dynamic analysis (except [1.1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html), which also required static analysis) of the Wacom Driver components (eg `Wacom_Tablet.exe`, `Remove.exe`, `WTabletServicePro.exe`, ...). I don't have any Wacom device but, one day, I got the chance to use one ([Wacom Intuos Small Graphic Tablet](https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos)). Only when a Wacom device is connected to the PC some features of [WacomDesktopCenter.exe](https://101.wacom.com/UserHelp/en/WDC.htm) are enabled, so I took this opportunity to understand what happens (through dynamic analysis) when these features are used and, consequently, to look for some possible vulnerabilities. Unfortunately the analysis of all the unlocked features didn't get me anywhere because they're managed by `WacomDesktopCenter.exe`, which runs and performs its operations with the privileges of the current user. Not knowing what else to analyze, as a last resort, I tried to understand what happens when a Wacom device is plugged\unplugged via USB, and I discovered an unexpected and pleasant surprise 🙃

## Analyzing the Wacom device plugging\unplugging 🔍

### Using [Process Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) I discovered that, when a Wacom device is plugged\unplugged via USB to the PC, `%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\Wacom_Tablet.exe` is triggered and runs under the context of [SYSTEM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account). Once triggered it tries to download the `update.xml` file from a Wacom server (<http://link.wacom.com/wdc/update.xml>) and, if the file get downloaded properly, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` saves it, without [impersonating](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/com/impersonation) the current user, into the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder. Here's the problem: the `wactemp` folder isn't created during the Wacom Driver installation therefore, the first time a Wacom device will be plugged in, and `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be able to download the `update.xml` file from the Wacom server, the `wactemp` folder will be created (and it will no longer be deleted because it will be used to store the updated versions of the `update.xml` file) and the downloaded `update.xml` file will be saved in it. You can see the creation of the `wactemp` folder and the `update.xml` file in the following image, obtained by analyzing with Process Monitor the first Wacom device plugging event.

![](media/wactemp&update.jpg "The first Wacom device plugging")

### But what if we create a `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` [NTFS volume mount point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_volume_mount_point) before that happens? We can do it because the regular user has [special access](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html#par6) to the `%windir%\Temp` folder... Notes: * `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `wactemp` folder only once because it will no longer be deleted after the first creation. * When `Wacom_Tablet.exe` saves the downloaded `update.xml` file into the `wactemp` folder, if an older version of the `update.xml` is already present, it will be overwritten by the new one. * If the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point isn't created before `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder, it will no longer be possible to create it, because the regular user cannot delete the folders\files stored in the `%windir%\Temp` folder. * If the PC isn't connected to the Internet, or the `update.xml` file download process fails for some reason, the `wactemp` folder and the `update.xml` file will not be created. * `Wacom_Tablet.exe` tries to repeat the `update.xml` file download and save procedure even during the Wacom device unplugging event. * As the name itself says, the `update.xml` file is necessary to understand if an update of the Wacom Driver (or some of its components related to the Wacom device used by the user) is available, and if the update is supported by the current version of the operating system. In case `update.xml` is no longer available on the [Wacom server](http://link.wacom.com/wdc/update.xml) and you want to analyze it, I saved a copy [here](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/blob/main/Files/update.xml) (downloaded on 2022-08-27). * I suppose `Wacom_Tablet.exe` repeats the `update.xml` file download and save procedure every time a Wacom device is plugged\unplugged to the PC because it wants to check if there are updates for that particular device and, the data of a Wacom device, is collected at the time of its plugging\unplugging. An alternative could be to store only the data of the new connected Wacom devices and search for updates only once a day (or at regular time intervals), without depending on the connection of a device. Could it work? 🤔

## An Arbitrary File Write\Overwrite primitive 📝

### Probably, if you have read these four articles ([1](../ZDI-CAN-16857/index.html), [2](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html), [3](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html) and [4](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html)), by now you will have understood that when the situation just described occurs, the [link following attack](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/59.html) is the first thing that comes to mind and, even in this case, it can be applied in a similar way to what has been done [here](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par4) and [here](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html#par6). We can create a `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` [NTFS volume mount point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_volume_mount_point) to [\RPC Control](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/08/windows-exploitation-tricks-exploiting.html) before `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder. Then we can create a [Symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link) from `\RPC Control\update.xml` to a file we want to write\overwrite (in my POC I used `%windir%\win.ini`). Now the workflow is quite simple: when the user plugs in a Wacom device, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be triggered, download the `update.xml` file from the Wacom server (if the PC is connected to the Internet), create the `wactemp` folder (if it hasn't already been created) and save the downloaded `update.xml` file in it. However, since we've created the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point, when `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will try to save the `update.xml` file into `%windir%\Temp\wactemp`, it will consider our mount point as a valid `wactemp` folder and try to write the downloaded `update.xml` file in it. Since `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` is a mount point to `\RPC Control`, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected (reparsed) and will try to write `\RPC Control\update.xml`. Since `\RPC Control\update.xml` is a symbolic link to our target file (eg `%windir%\win.ini`), `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected again, and will write\overwrite the target file (and it will succeed because it's running under the context of `SYSTEM`) with the content of the downloaded `update.xml`. If the target file doesn't exist, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will create it and write the content of the downloaded `update.xml` in it, otherwise it will overwrite the contents of the already existing file with the content of the downloaded `update.xml`. In the following image you can see `Wacom_Tablet.exe` reparsed to the target file after creating the `wactemp` mountpoint and plugging, for the first time, a Wacom device.

![](media/Wacom_Tablet.exe_reparsed.jpg "Wacom_Tablet.exe reparsed to %windir%\win.ini")

## The Exploit ☠️

### The exploit that I wrote is based on the aforementioned workflow and performs the following steps: 1. Ask the user which file he wants to write\overwrite (let's suppose `%windir%\win.ini`). 2. Create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point to `\RPC Control`. 3. Create the `\RPC Control\update.xml` symbolic link to `%windir%\win.ini`. 4. When the user plugs in a Wacom device, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` is triggered (and runs under the context of `SYSTEM`). 5. `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will download the `update.xml` file from a Wacom server and try to save it into the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder. 6. Since `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` is a mount point to `\RPC Control`, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected and will try to write `\RPC Control\update.xml`. 7. Since `\RPC Control\update.xml` is a symbolic link to `%windir%\win.ini`, `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected again, and will overwrite `%windir%\win.ini` with the content of the downloaded `update.xml`. [Here](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Exploit/Exploit.bat) you can find my exploit. If your operating system is not installed on the C drive, modify the exploit by replacing `CreateMountPoint.exe "C:\Windows\Temp\wactemp" "\RPC Control"` with `CreateMountPoint.exe "%windir%\Temp\wactemp" "\RPC Control"`. `CreateMountPoint.exe` and `CreateSymlink.exe` are programs developed by [James Forshaw](https://twitter.com/tiraniddo) and are downloadable from his [symboliclink-testing-tools](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools) repository, respectively [here](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools/tree/main/CreateMountPoint) and [here](https://github.com/googleprojectzero/symboliclink-testing-tools/tree/main/CreateSymlink).

## POC 🎦

### I've tested the exploit only on Wacom Driver 6.3.46-1 but, most likely, it also works for the previous versions (and I hope not on the future ones 🙄). The Wacom device I plugged in to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` is Wacom Intuos Small Graphic Tablet, but any Wacom device should be fine.

![](media/POC.gif "Exploitation Proof Of Concept")

## Constraints & workarounds ⛔↪️

### To successfully exploit the arbitrary file write vulnerability we must face the following constraints: 1. We must create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point before `Wacom_Tablet.exe` creates the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder (otherwise we'll not be able to create the mount point). 2. The PC must be connected to the Internet (otherwise `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will not be able to download the `update.xml` file). 3. We ~~must~~ have a Wacom device (otherwise we won't be able to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe`). To face the previous constraints, I came up with the following workarounds: 1. We've two possibilities: 1. The system administrator installs the Wacom Driver and we've the possibility to log into our account before he connects a Wacom device. In this case `Wacom_Tablet.exe` has never been triggered and, consequently, the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder has not been created yet. 2. We create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` mount point before the system administrator installs the Wacom Driver. We don't know if the system administrator will install it but, if he does, we'll be able to exploit the vulnerability even if he will connect a Wacom device before we can log into our account. 2. If the PC can be connected to the Internet the problem doesn't arise, otherwise we've two possibilities: 1. If the PC can use a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection, we can use our mobile phone as an Internet hotspot. 2. If the PC has no connections, we can use a [mobile broadband modem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_broadband_modem) or, more simply, we can connect a [wireless USB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_USB) (in this second case, we're in the same situation described in the previous point, so we can use our mobile phone as an Internet hotspot). 3. This last problem is quite difficult to solve (for me, of course 😢); in the next paragraph I propose the only possible workaround I found.

## Wacom USB device plugging\unplugging simulation 🔌

### Is it possible to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` without plugging or unplugging a Wacom device? I analyzed several executable files (which are installed during the installation of the Wacom Driver) through static analysis to look for some interesting parameters that could be used to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe`, forcing it to download the `update.xml` file, but I didn't find anything interesting. I tried to emulate a Wacom device on Windows but, the only emulators I found were those of Wacom PenPartner tablet (already included in [QEMU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU)), and [those](https://github.com/thenickdude/wacom-qemu) developed by [Nicholas Sherlock](https://www.nicksherlock.com/) (for Wacom Bamboo and Wacom Intuos 5 graphics tablet), which can be added to [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/). Unfortunately all three emulators are designed to run on QEMU, and my goal is to emulate a Wacom device on Windows, not on a Windows virtual machine running within QEMU. At this point, the only plausible way I’ve found to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` without plugging or unplugging a Wacom device, is to simulate (through a software) the Wacom USB device plugging (or unplugging) event. Searching the net I found out that other people also needed, for different reasons, to simulate the USB plugging event of a particular device (as you can read [here](https://superuser.com/questions/1452768/record-usb-input-and-emulate-it-later) and [here](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/simulate-a-device-being-plugged-into-windows-10/609881/16)). In [this](https://forum.arduino.cc/t/simulate-a-device-being-plugged-into-windows-10/609881/16) forum [zwieblum](https://forum.arduino.cc/u/zwieblum) proposes an interesting way to simulate the plugging event of a general USB device, which consists in taking a dump (the packets that are exchanged) of the initial USB device communication, and reproducing it when you want to simulate the USB device plugging. To take a dump of the initial USB device communication on Windows, we can use the [USBPcap](https://desowin.org/usbpcap/) feature on [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) (read [this](https://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB#windows) article and watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvh5tqsVjf0&ab_channel=SKSolutions) video for more details). To replay the captured packets back using a software (without any physical device flashing or other ways that require a physical device) it's not that simple, but [usbrply](https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply) is the software that's right for us. It has been developed by [John Mcmaster](https://twitter.com/johndmcmaster), and allows you to convert a [.pcap](https://www.solarwinds.com/resources/it-glossary/pcap) file (captured USB packets) to Python or C code that replays the captured USB commands. In our case we are interested in capturing only the first packets, which are exchanged in the first seconds in which the Wacom device is plugged-in and correctly recognized (or those exchanged at the moment of the device unplugging), to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe`. I captured twice [the packets exchanged upon plugging](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Files/Plugging) and five times [those exchanged upon unplugging](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Files/Unplugging). I configured usbrply as indicated [here](https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply#sample-workflows) (with `VID = 0x056A` and `PID = 0x0376` (taken from the string `USB\VID_056A&PID_0376` (read [this](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/blob/main/Files/vendor_and_device_ID.txt) file to figure out how to get that string))) and tried to reproduce the captured packets back. For some reason all the attempts to reproduce the captured packets back have failed, for both types of packages (those that should have simulated the device plugging and those that should have simulated its unplugging). I reached out to Nicholas Sherlock to ask him for help and some possible solution but, at the moment, no solution has been found. However, I think this is the right way to simulate a Wacom device plugging\unplugging event to trigger `Wacom_Tablet.exe` without connecting any real device but, at the moment, I don't have the time to understand where the catch is. I'd like to go back to investigate this question in the future and, if in the meantime you find the catch (or an alternative solution), send me a mail at *luca.barile.research@gmail.com*; I'll update this paragraph by adding your solution 😉

## From Arbitrary File Write\Overwrite to Windows Denial of Service 🪟❌

### Another idea would be to use our Arbitrary File Write\Overwrite primitive for a permanent Windows Denial of Service attack. If we want to deny the user to use the Windows OS (preventing it from booting properly), we could think to delete a file (or more files) necessary for its booting, like I did [here](../CVE-2022-38604/index.html#par8). Curiously though, searching a bit on the net I ended up on [this](https://labs.redyops.com/index.php/2020/04/27/dos-via-arbitrary-folder-creation/) page, which made me discover a different way (to create the `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` file (or folder)) to prevent Windows from booting and bring up the famous [BSoD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_screen_of_death). This may seem quite counterintuitive because it seems much more reasonable to delete some files needed to start the operating system to prevent Windows from booting, rather than creating a file (or a folder), even empty... Yet, as you can see in the PoC below, this technique works properly!

![](media/BSoD.gif "cng.sys (file or folder) causes the Windows BSoD")

### So, if we want to use the exploit shown in the [previous POC](#par6) to get a persistent Windows Denial of Service, all we have to do is enter `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` when we're asked which file we want to overwrite. Since `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` doesn't exist in standard Windows installations, it will be created and, the next time Windows starts, the BSoD will be displayed (and the auto-repair Windows procedure won't be able to fix the problem).

## Something more on cng.sys 🔐

### What is `cng.sys`? What is it for? Why does its creation prevent Windows from booting? From the [.sys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.sys) filename extension we can deduce that it's a system file, so it probably contains device drivers or hardware configurations for the system. [Here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/about-cng) Microsoft confirms that it's a driver and, in particular, it's the Cryptography Next Generation (CNG) kernel driver. The CNG API is the successor of [CryptoAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_CryptoAPI) (which is now deprecated), and consists of [several primitives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cryptographic-primitives) that provides a set of functions useful for basic cryptographic operations. These cryptographic operations are used by many programs to protect the user's privacy and keep its data confidential. When Windows is installed (in my case I'm referring to Windows 10, but this probably also applies to other Windows versions), the `cng.sys` file doesn't exist in the `%windir%\system32` folder, because it's installed into `%windir%\system32\drivers` folder, and only [TrustedInstaller](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-trustedinstaller-and-why-does-it-keep-me-from-renaming-files/) has full access on it. Since, for the reasons just described, `cng.sys` is a very important Windows kernel driver, the operating system loads it from `%windir%\system32\drivers` at startup but, if another `cng.sys` file (or folder) exists in the `%windir%\system32` folder, Windows loads it as well! If the `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` is a fake file (or a folder), the operating system crashes during its loading, bringing up the BSoD. This probably happens because of a wrong file search order; Windows looks for the `cng.sys` file first in the `%windir%\system32` folder and then in the `%windir%\system32\drivers` (or it follows another order but, at some point, it tries to load the `%windir%\system32\cng.sys` file anyway). I don't know why Windows doesn't load `cng.sys` only from the right folder. Can it be because in previous versions of Windows it was located in `%windir%\system32`, and then it was moved to `%windir%\system32\drivers` but the developers forgot to update its folders search order? Probably other Windows drivers can be exploited to get a BSoD as well. Do you know another one? Send me a mail at *luca.barile.research@gmail.com*; I'll update this paragraph by adding a list of drivers affected by the same problem 📋 PS Just to stay on topic... Did you know that a Security Feature Bypass vulnerability was found in `cng.sys`? Take a look at [CVE-2018-0902](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-0902/) for more details.

## How to fix the vulnerability 🚑

### There are several solutions: * Create the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` folder directly during the Wacom Driver installation process, so that the user can't create a mount point in its place. With this solution the user could still create files inside the folder, which could interfere in some way with the Wacom Drivers activities, so I don't think this is the best solution. * Force `Wacom_Tablet.exe` to impersonate the user while creating the `%windir%\Temp\wactemp\update.xml` file. By doing this, the link following attack will fail because when `Wacom_Tablet.exe` will be redirected, it will only be able to write\overwrite files that the user can already write\overwrite on his own. * Create the `wactemp` folder under `%ProgramFiles%\Tablet\Wacom\` (where the user doesn't have write access). * Check that `%windir%\Temp\wactemp` isn't a symbolic link before creating the `update.xml` file in it. With this solution we've the same problem described in the first point. * Change the update process logic, checking for updates directly by querying a Wacom server, without downloading any files to a temporary folder.

## Vulnerability disclosure timeline 📅

### First of all, I checked if the vendor has launched a bug bounty program but, unfortunately, Wacom Technology Corporation has none and the only page where you can report something ([this](https://support.wacom.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)), doesn't speak explicitly of any acknowledgement (neither meritocratically nor economically). At this point I followed the MITRE [researcher reservation guidelines](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines) and, since Wacom Technology Corporation isn't on the [CNAs partner list](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners), the only two remaining possibilities were to contact the CNA of Last Resort ([CNA-LR](https://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html#cna-lr)) through the [CVE Request web form](https://cveform.mitre.org/) or a [third-party coordinator CNAs](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines#process#4) (read [this](https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/a-simple-guide-to-getting-cves-published/) interesting article for more information on how to get a CVE published). Since the CNA of Last Resort, as the word itself says, is the last resort (🏝️), I looked for a third-party CNA in the CNAs list and decided to contact the [Zero Day Initiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/) CNA. ZDI relieves you from the burden of tracking the bug with the vendor, could make a monetary offer to the researcher (CNA of Last Resort doesn't), follows a [responsible vulnerability disclosure](https://www.bugcrowd.com/resource/what-is-responsible-disclosure/) policy and has a [loyalty program](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/about/benefits/) (CNA of Last Resort doesn't). You can learn more about their disclosure policy [here](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/disclosure_policy/). * 2022-07-30 (GMT+1) - I discovered the vulnerability. * 2022-08-27 (GMT-6) - I reported the vulnerability to ZDI (CASE OPENED). * 2022-08-29 (GMT-6) - ZDI assigned the case (CASE ASSIGNED). * 2022-09-30 (GMT+1) - I asked ZDI for an update. * 2022-09-30 (GMT+1) - ZDI replied that they're currently experiencing high case volumes so I can expect several weeks for reply. * 2022-10-04 (GMT-6) - ZDI investigated the case (CASE INVESTIGATED). * 2022-10-12 (GMT+1) - ZDI replied that they aren't interested in this vulnerability because it requires a Wacom device for testing (CASE CLOSED) 🤔 At this point the only alternative left is the CNA of Last Resort (CNA-LR), so I decided to use the CVE Request web form to report the vulnerability. * 2022-10-12 (GMT+1) - I submitted the vulnerability to CNA-LR. * 2022-10-12 (GMT+1) - CNA-LR assigned the ID 1344351 to my request. * 2022-11-14 (GMT+1) - CNA-LR reserved the [CVE-2022-43293](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43293) ID for my vulnerability. * 2022-12-15 (GMT+1) - I asked to CNA-LR for an update (no answare...). * 2023-01-22 (GMT+1) - I asked to CNA-LR again for an update (no answare...). * 2023-02-22 (GMT+1) - I asked to CNA-LR again for an update (no answare...). * 2023-04-07 (GMT+1) - I decided to make the [exploit](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293/tree/main/Exploit/) for this vulnerability (and related report) public on my GitHub [page](https://github.com/LucaBarile/CVE-2022-43293) and informed MITRE through CNA-LR.

## Final considerations

### The references that have been useful to me to write this article and the exploit code are already present, in the form of links, in the previous paragraphs you have read and that make up this article. The conclusions are very similar to those that I wrote in some of my previous articles ([1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/lpe/index.html), [1.1](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_r/index.html), [1.2](../ZDI-CAN-16318/arb_rw/index.html) and [2](../ZDI-CAN-16857/index.html)) and concern the logical vulnerabilities and the link following attack technique. The vulnerability I described in this article is just another example of a logical vulnerability discovered through dynamic analysis using Process Monitor and, if you've read my previous articles related to logical vulnerabilities, I think that the paragraphs that might be most interesting for you are the following three: [1](#par8), [2](#par9) and [3](#par10). In this particular scenario a device is needed to trigger the vulnerability, and find a software technique that allows the exploit to simulate its interactions (at least those necessary to trigger the vulnerability (e.g. device plugging\unplugging)), would make its presence unnecessary, and wouldn't require particular operations by the user during the exploit execution (he just has to enter the path of the file to write\overwrite). More generally, all the exploits related to vulnerabilities that fall under this scenario would be device-independent and, therefore, more powerful. For this reason, I suggest you deepen this "software technique", and I think [this](#par8) is a good starting point.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

The **Quick Emulator** (**QEMU**)[[4]](#cite_note-4) is a [free and open-source](/wiki/Free_and_open-source "Free and open-source") [emulator](/wiki/Emulator "Emulator") that uses dynamic [binary translation](/wiki/Binary_translation "Binary translation") to emulate a [computer](/wiki/Computer "Computer")'s [processor](/wiki/Central_processing_unit "Central processing unit"); that is, it translates the emulated binary codes to an equivalent binary format which is executed by the machine. It provides a variety of hardware and device models for the virtual machine, enabling it to run different [guest operating systems](/wiki/Guest_operating_system "Guest operating system"). QEMU can be used with a [Kernel-based Virtual Machine](/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine") (KVM) to emulate hardware at near-native speeds. Additionally, it supports [user-level processes](/wiki/User_space_and_kernel_space "User space and kernel space"), allowing applications compiled for one processor architecture to run on another.[[5]](#cite_note-hoxLZ3-5)

QEMU supports the emulation of [x86](/wiki/X86 "X86"), [ARM](/wiki/ARM_architecture_family "ARM architecture family"), [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC "PowerPC"), [RISC-V](/wiki/RISC-V "RISC-V"), and [other architectures](#Emulated_hardware_platforms).

## Licensing

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Licensing")]

QEMU is [free software](/wiki/Free_software "Free software") developed by [Fabrice Bellard](/wiki/Fabrice_Bellard "Fabrice Bellard"). Different components of QEMU are licensed under the [GNU General Public License](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License") (GPL), [BSD license](/wiki/BSD_license "BSD license"), [GNU Lesser General Public License](/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License "GNU Lesser General Public License") (LGPL), or other GPL-compatible licenses.[[6]](#cite_note-tlXVo3-6)

## Operating modes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Operating modes")]

QEMU has multiple operating modes:[[7]](#cite_note-uVhFu3-7)

* **User-mode emulation.** In the user emulation mode, QEMU runs single [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") or [Darwin](/wiki/Darwin_%28operating_system%29 "Darwin (operating system)")/[macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") programs that were compiled for a different [instruction set](/wiki/Instruction_set "Instruction set"). [System calls](/wiki/System_call "System call") are [thunked](/wiki/Thunk "Thunk") for [endianness](/wiki/Endianness "Endianness") and for 32/64-bit mismatches. Fast [cross-compilation](/wiki/Cross-compilation "Cross-compilation") and cross-debugging are the main targets for user-mode emulation.
* **System emulation.** In the system emulation mode, QEMU emulates a full computer system, including [peripherals](/wiki/Peripheral "Peripheral"). It can be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual computers on a single computer. QEMU can boot many guest [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"), including [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux"), [Solaris](/wiki/Solaris_%28operating_system%29 "Solaris (operating system)"), [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"), [DOS](/wiki/DOS "DOS"), and [BSD](/wiki/BSD "BSD");[[8]](#cite_note-yfwuu3-8) it supports emulating several instruction sets, including [x86](/wiki/X86 "X86"), [x86-64](/wiki/X86-64 "X86-64"), [MIPS](/wiki/MIPS_architecture "MIPS architecture"), [ARMv7](/wiki/ARMv7 "ARMv7"), [ARMv8](/wiki/ARMv8 "ARMv8"), [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC "PowerPC"), [RISC-V](/wiki/RISC-V "RISC-V"), [SPARC](/wiki/SPARC "SPARC"), [ETRAX CRIS](/wiki/ETRAX_CRIS "ETRAX CRIS") and [MicroBlaze](/wiki/MicroBlaze "MicroBlaze").
* **Hypervisor support.** In the hypervisor support mode, QEMU either acts as a Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) or as a device emulation back-end for [virtual machines](/wiki/Virtual_machines "Virtual machines") running under a [hypervisor](/wiki/Hypervisor "Hypervisor"). The most common is Linux's [KVM](/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine") but the project supports a number of hypervisors including [Xen](/wiki/Xen "Xen"), Apple's HVF, Windows' WHPX, and NetBSD's NVMM.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

## Features

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Features")]

QEMU supports the emulation of various architectures, including [x86](/wiki/X86 "X86"), [MIPS64](/wiki/MIPS_architecture "MIPS architecture") (up to Release 6),[[10]](#cite_note-aLeNi3-10) [SPARC](/wiki/SPARC "SPARC") (sun4m and sun4u), [ARM](/wiki/ARM_architecture "ARM architecture") (Integrator/CP and Versatile/PB), [SuperH](/wiki/SuperH "SuperH"), [PowerPC](/wiki/PowerPC "PowerPC") ([PReP](/wiki/PReP "PReP") and [Power Macintosh](/wiki/Power_Macintosh "Power Macintosh")), [ETRAX CRIS](/wiki/ETRAX_CRIS "ETRAX CRIS"), [MicroBlaze](/wiki/MicroBlaze "MicroBlaze"), and [RISC-V](/wiki/RISC-V "RISC-V"). It supports saving the virtual machine state while all programs are running. Guest operating systems do not need patching to run inside QEMU.

The virtual machine can interface with many types of physical host hardware, including the user's hard disks, [CD-ROM drives](/wiki/Optical_disc_drive "Optical disc drive"), [network cards](/wiki/Network_interface_controller "Network interface controller"), [audio interfaces](/wiki/Sound_card "Sound card"), and USB devices. USB devices can be emulated entirely, or the host's USB devices can be used, although this requires administrator privileges and does not work with some devices.

Virtual disk images can be stored in [QCOW](/wiki/QCOW "QCOW") format, which can significantly reduce image size. QCOW images only occupy the actual used disk space, not the full configured capacity. This means a configured 120 GB disk may only occupy a few hundred megabytes on the host, as QCOW does not store unused disk space in the image file.

The QCOW2 format also allows the creation of overlay images, which are files that store only the changes made from an original (unmodified) base image file. This enables the emulated disk's contents to be reverted to an earlier state. For instance, a base image could contain a fresh installation of a known working operating system, and overlay images can be used to record changes. Should the guest system become unusable (through virus attack, accidental system destruction, etc.), the user can delete the overlay and use an earlier emulated disk image.

QEMU can emulate network cards (of different models) that share the host system's connectivity by translating network addresses, effectively allowing the guest to use the same network as the host. The virtual network cards can also connect to network cards of other instances of QEMU or to local [TAP](/wiki/TUN/TAP "TUN/TAP") interfaces. Network connectivity can also be achieved by bridging a TUN/TAP interface used by QEMU with a non-virtual Ethernet interface on the host OS using the host OS's bridging features.

QEMU integrates several services to allow the host and guest systems to communicate for example: an integrated [SMB](/wiki/Server_Message_Block "Server Message Block") server and network-port redirection (to allow incoming connections to the virtual machine). It can also boot Linux kernels without a [bootloader](/wiki/Bootloader "Bootloader").

QEMU does not depend on the presence of graphical output methods on the host system. Instead, it provides access to the guest OS screen via an integrated [VNC](/wiki/VNC "VNC") server. It can also use an emulated serial line without any screen, with applicable operating systems.

Simulating multiple CPUs running [SMP](/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing "Symmetric multiprocessing") is possible.

QEMU does not require administrative rights to run unless additional kernel modules are used to improve speed (like [KQEMU](#Accelerator)) or certain modes of its network connectivity model are utilized.

### Tiny Code Generator

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Tiny Code Generator")]

The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) aims to remove the shortcoming of relying on a particular version of [GCC](/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection "GNU Compiler Collection") or any [compiler](/wiki/Compiler "Compiler"), instead incorporating the compiler into other tasks performed by QEMU at run time. The whole translation task thus consists of two parts: [basic blocks](/wiki/Basic_block "Basic block") of target code (*TBs*) being rewritten in *TCG ops* – a kind of machine-independent intermediate notation, and subsequently this notation being compiled for the host's architecture by TCG. Optional optimization passes are performed between them, for a [just-in-time compiler](/wiki/Just-in-time_compiler "Just-in-time compiler") (JIT) mode.

TCG requires dedicated code written to support every architecture it runs on, so that the JIT knows what to translate the *TCG ops* to. If no dedicated JIT code is available for the architecture, TCG falls back to a slow [interpreter](/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29 "Interpreter (computing)") mode called TCG Interpreter (TCI). It also requires updating the target code to use TCG ops instead of the old *DynGen* ops.[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3APlease_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*]

Starting with QEMU Version 0.10.0, TCG ships with the QEMU stable release. It replaces *DynGen*, which relied on GCC 3.x to work.[[11]](#cite_note-DhNAG3-11)[[12]](#cite_note-8NZ3y3-12)

### Accelerator

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Accelerator")]

KQEMU was a [Linux kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") [module](/wiki/Loadable_kernel_module "Loadable kernel module"), also written by [Fabrice Bellard](/wiki/Fabrice_Bellard "Fabrice Bellard"), which notably sped up emulation of x86 or x86-64 guests on platforms with the same CPU architecture. This worked by running [user mode](/wiki/User_mode "User mode") code (and optionally some kernel code) directly on the host computer's CPU, and by using processor and peripheral emulation only for [kernel-mode](/wiki/Kernel_mode "Kernel mode") and [real-mode](/wiki/Real_mode "Real mode") code. KQEMU could execute code from many guest operating systems even if the host CPU did not support [hardware-assisted virtualization](/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization "Hardware-assisted virtualization"). KQEMU was initially a [closed-source](/wiki/Closed-source "Closed-source") product available free of charge but starting from version 1.3.0pre10 (February 2007),[[13]](#cite_note-xrH6Q-13) it was [relicensed](/wiki/Software_relicensing "Software relicensing") under the [GNU General Public License](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License"). QEMU versions starting with 0.12.0 (as of August 2009[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit)) support large memory which makes them incompatible with KQEMU.[[14]](#cite_note-KjeBA-14) Newer releases of QEMU have completely removed support for KQEMU.

QVM86 was a [GNU GPLv2](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License") licensed drop-in replacement for the then closed-source KQEMU. The developers of QVM86 ceased development in January 2007.

[Kernel-based Virtual Machine](/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine") (*KVM*) has mostly taken over as the Linux-based hardware-assisted virtualization solution for use with QEMU following the lack of support for KQEMU and QVM86.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*] QEMU can also use KVM on other architectures like [ARM](/wiki/ARM_architecture "ARM architecture") and [MIPS](/wiki/MIPS_architecture "MIPS architecture").[[15]](#cite_note-aOKWh-15)

Intel's Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (*HAXM*) is an open-source alternative[[16]](#cite_note-Wsj2a-16) to KVM for x86-based hardware-assisted virtualization on NetBSD, Linux, Windows and macOS using [Intel VT](/wiki/Intel_VT "Intel VT"). As of 2013[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit) Intel mostly solicits its use with QEMU for Android development.[[17]](#cite_note-g4gd5-17) Starting with version 2.9.0, the official QEMU includes support for HAXM, under the name *Hax*.[[18]](#cite_note-qemu-inv-18)

QEMU also supports the following accelerators:[[18]](#cite_note-qemu-inv-18)

* *hvf*, Apple's `Hypervisor.framework` based on Intel VT.
* *whpx*, Microsoft's Windows Hypervisor Platform based on Intel VT or AMD-V.
* *tcg*, QEMU's own [Tiny Code Generator](#Tiny_Code_Generator). This is the default.

### Supported disk image formats

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Supported disk image formats")]

QEMU supports the following [disk image](/wiki/Disk_image "Disk image") formats:[[19]](#cite_note-X1QXO3-19)

* [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") [Universal Disk Image Format](/wiki/Universal_Disk_Image_Format "Universal Disk Image Format") (`.dmg`) – Read-only
* [Bochs](/wiki/Bochs "Bochs") – Read-only
* [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") [cloop](/wiki/Cloop "Cloop") – Read-only
* [Parallels](/wiki/Parallels%2C_Inc. "Parallels, Inc.") disk image (`.hdd`, `.hds`) – Read-only
* [QEMU copy-on-write](/wiki/Qcow "Qcow") (`.qcow2`, `.qed`, `.qcow`, `.cow`)
* [VirtualBox](/wiki/VirtualBox "VirtualBox") [Virtual Disk Image](/wiki/VDI_%28file_format%29 "VDI (file format)") (`.vdi`)
* [Virtual PC](/wiki/Virtual_PC "Virtual PC") [Virtual Hard Disk](/wiki/VHD_%28file_format%29 "VHD (file format)") (`.vhd`)
* Virtual [VFAT](/wiki/VFAT "VFAT")
* [VMware](/wiki/VMware "VMware") [Virtual Machine Disk](/wiki/VMDK "VMDK") (`.vmdk`)
* [Raw images](/wiki/IMG_%28file_format%29 "IMG (file format)") (`.img`) that contain sector-by-sector contents of a disk
* [CD/DVD images](/wiki/ISO_image "ISO image") (`.iso`) that contain sector-by-sector contents of an optical disk (e.g. booting live OSes)[[20]](#cite_note-XFZZb3-20)

### QEMU Object Model

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: QEMU Object Model")]

The **QEMU Object Model** (QOM) provides a framework for registering types that users can make and instantiating objects from those types.[[21]](#cite_note-The_QEMU_Object_Model_(QOM);_Repository3-21)

QOM provides the following features:

* System for dynamically registering types
* Support for single-inheritance of types
* Multiple inheritances of stateless interfaces

See also: [Object model](/wiki/Object_model "Object model")
## Parallel emulation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Parallel emulation")]

Virtualization solutions that use QEMU can execute multiple virtual CPUs in parallel. For user-mode emulation, QEMU maps emulated threads to host threads. QEMU can run a host thread for each emulated virtual CPU (vCPU) for full system emulation. This depends on the guest being updated to support parallel system emulation, currently ARM, Alpha, HP-PA, PowerPC, RISC-V, s390x, x86, and Xtensa. Otherwise, a single thread is used to emulate all virtual CPUs (vCPUs), which executes each vCPU in a round-robin manner.

## Integration

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Integration")]
### VirtualBox

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: VirtualBox")]

[VirtualBox](/wiki/VirtualBox "VirtualBox"), first released in January 2007, used some of QEMU's virtual hardware devices, and had a built-in [dynamic re-compiler](/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation "Dynamic recompilation") based on QEMU. As with KQEMU, VirtualBox runs nearly all guest code natively on the host via the VMM (Virtual Machine Manager) and uses the re-compiler only as a fallback mechanism – for example, when guest code executes in [real mode](/wiki/Real_mode "Real mode").[[22]](#cite_note-LMJ9L3-22) In addition, VirtualBox did a lot of code analysis and patching using a built-in disassembler to minimize recompilation. VirtualBox is free and open-source (available under [GPL](/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License "GNU General Public License")), except for certain features.

### Xen-HVM

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Xen-HVM")]

[Xen](/wiki/Xen "Xen"), a virtual machine monitor, can run in HVM (hardware virtual machine) mode, using [Intel VT-x](/wiki/Intel_VT-x "Intel VT-x") or [AMD-V](/wiki/AMD-V "AMD-V") hardware [x86 virtualization](/wiki/X86_virtualization "X86 virtualization") extensions and [ARM](/wiki/ARM_architecture "ARM architecture") [Cortex-A7](/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A7 "ARM Cortex-A7") and [Cortex-A15](/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A15 "ARM Cortex-A15") virtualization extensions.[[23]](#cite_note-ZfeJ33-23) This means that instead of para-virtualized devices, a real set of virtual hardware is exposed to the DomU, enabling it to use real device drivers.

QEMU includes several components: CPU emulators, emulated devices, generic devices, machine descriptions, user interface, and a debugger. The emulated devices and generic devices in QEMU make up its device models for I/O virtualization.[[24]](#cite_note-Fu2I73-24) They comprise a PIIX3 IDE (with some rudimentary PIIX4 capabilities), Cirrus Logic or plain VGA emulated video, RTL8139 or E1000 network emulation, and ACPI support.[[25]](#cite_note-29Ixu3-25) APIC support is provided by Xen.

Xen-HVM utilizes device emulation based on the QEMU project to deliver I/O virtualization to virtual machines (VMs). Hardware is emulated through a QEMU "device model" daemon running as a backend in Dom0. Unlike other QEMU modes, such as dynamic translation or KVM, the hypervisor fully manages virtual CPUs, pausing them as necessary while QEMU handles memory-mapped I/O emulation.

### KVM

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: KVM")]

[KVM](/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine "Kernel-based Virtual Machine") (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is a FreeBSD and Linux kernel module that allows a [user space](/wiki/User_space "User space") program access to the [hardware virtualization](/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization "Hardware-assisted virtualization") features of various processors, with which QEMU can offer virtualization for x86, PowerPC, and S/390 guests. When the target architecture is the same as the host architecture, QEMU can make use of KVM particular features, such as acceleration.

### Win4Lin Pro Desktop

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Win4Lin Pro Desktop")]

In early 2005, [Win4Lin](/wiki/Win4Lin "Win4Lin") introduced Win4Lin Pro Desktop, based on a 'tuned' version of QEMU and KQEMU and it hosts NT-versions of Windows. In June 2006,[[26]](#cite_note-7MfDb3-26) Win4Lin released Win4Lin Virtual Desktop Server based on the same code base. Win4Lin Virtual Desktop Server serves Microsoft Windows sessions to thin clients from a Linux server.

In September 2006, Win4Lin announced a change of the company name to [Virtual Bridges](https://web.archive.org/web/20110613051010/http%3A//www.vbridges.com/home.php) with the release of Win4BSD Pro Desktop, a port of the product to FreeBSD and PC-BSD. Solaris support followed in May 2007 with the release of Win4Solaris Pro Desktop and Win4Solaris Virtual Desktop Server.[[27]](#cite_note-jGa1D3-27)

### SerialICE

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: SerialICE")]

SerialICE is a QEMU-based firmware debugging tool running system firmware inside of QEMU while accessing real hardware through a serial connection to a host system. This can be used as a cheap replacement for hardware [in-circuit emulators](/wiki/In-circuit_emulation "In-circuit emulation") (ICE).[[28]](#cite_note-SEdrl3-28)

### WinUAE

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: WinUAE")]

[WinUAE](/wiki/UAE_%28emulator%29 "UAE (emulator)") introduced support for the [CyberStorm PPC and Blizzard 603e boards](/wiki/PowerUP_%28accelerator%29 "PowerUP (accelerator)") using the QEMU PPC core in version 3.0.0.[[29]](#cite_note-N2pRW3-29)

### Unicorn

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Unicorn")]

Unicorn is a CPU emulation framework based on QEMU's "TCG" CPU emulator. Unlike QEMU, Unicorn focuses on the CPU *only*: no emulation of any peripherals is provided and raw binary code (outside of the context of an executable file or a system image) can be run directly. Unicorn is thread-safe and has multiple bindings and instrumentation interfaces.[[30]](#cite_note-ggqXJ3-30)

### Limbo x86 PC Emulator

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=QEMU&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Limbo x86 PC Emulator")]

Limbo is an x86 and [ARM64](/wiki/ARM64 "ARM64") QEMU-based virtual machine for Android.[[31]](#cite_note-31) It is one of the few pieces of virtual machine software available for Android capable of emulating Microsoft Windows,[[32]](#cite_note-32) although it was designed to emulate Linux and DOS. Unlike other QEMU-based emulators, it does not require users to type commands to use, instead having a user interface to set the virtual machine's settings.

It is more popular in developing countries in Asia such as India, Malaysia, and Thailand on YouTube due to the high usage of the Android Operating System.[[33]](#cite_note-33) Limbo was removed from the Google Play Store for unknown reasons between February 2019 and December 2020, though it can still be installed off the developer's website with an [APK](/wiki/Apk_%28file_format%29 "Apk (file format)") (Android Package) installation.[[34]](#cite_note-34) Limbo tends to have issues regarding its audio quality and playback. No fixes have been found for these problems as of 2024.[[35]](#cite_note-35) Overall, Limbo is less well-known than other virtual machine software, which leads to less available information regarding its troubleshooting.

It is required to install an application known as "Hacker's Keyboard" to use many keyboard functions that a basic Android keyboard cannot do in Limbo x86, such as the Ctrl, Alt, Del, and function keys.[[36]](#cite_note-36) It is recommended to install Hacker's Keyboard with an APK file, as the Google Play version says it doesn't work with newer versions of Android.[[37]](#cite_note-37)[*[verification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3AVerifiability "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*]

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

# CaptureSetup/USB

# USB capture setup

This page is about capturing raw USB traffic, e.g. the packets a USB mouse will generate on the Universal Serial Bus.

## USB attached network interfaces

A special case are network interfaces connected to a host computer through an USB cable. The operating system "converts" the raw USB packets into the network traffic (e.g. Ethernet packets) and provides a network interface that looks like an ordinary network interface. So you can capture from:

* the USB device for raw USB traffic (if supported)
* the network device for "normal" network packets

The USB bus will add additional overhead, so the raw USB traffic will have higher volume than the network traffic, even if the only active USB devices on the system are network adapters. (If there are other active USB devices, the raw USB traffic will include traffic to and from those devices, so it will obviously have higher volume than Ethernet traffic.)

## Software only URB capture

Software USB capture captures URBs (USB Request Blocks) rather than raw USB packets. URBs are referred to in USB 2.0 Specification Chapter 10 as IRPs that are submitted to USBDI. URBs carry transfers as seen by host USB stack rather than individual transactions. The individual packets as described in USB 2.0 Specification Chapter 8 **are not** possible to capture with software sniffers.

### Linux

Capturing USB traffic on Linux is possible since Wireshark 1.2.0, libpcap 1.0.0, and Linux 2.6.11, using the Linux usbmon interface.

First, check if you belong to the `wireshark` group with:

`groupsÂ $USER`

To add yourself to the `wireshark` group, run the below command, then logout and login.

`sudoÂ adduserÂ $USERÂ wireshark`

Then ensure that non-superusers are allowed to capture packets in wireshark. Select `<Yes>` in the below prompt:

`sudoÂ dpkg-reconfigureÂ wireshark-common`

The next two commands may need to be re-run after every reboot:

To dump USB traffic on Linux, you need the [usbmon](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/usb/usbmon.txt) kernel module. If it is not loaded yet, run this command as root:

`modprobeÂ usbmon`

To give regular users privileges, make the usbmonX device(s) readable:

`sudoÂ setfaclÂ -mÂ u:$USER:rÂ /dev/usbmon*`

On some Linux distributions (Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, possibly others), the above command may not be necessary if you already belong to the `wireshark` group. See [CaptureSetup/CapturePrivileges: Most UNIXes.](/CaptureSetup/CapturePrivileges#most-unixes)

With Linux kernels prior to 2.6.23, you will also need to run this command as root:

`mountÂ -tÂ debugfsÂ noneÂ /sys/kernel/debug`

and, with those kernels, the usbmon mechanism's protocol limits the total amount of data captured for each raw USB block to about 30 bytes. With a 2.6.23 or later kernel, and libpcap 1.1.0 and later, that size limitation is removed. Use `unameÂ -r` to check your kernel version.

In libpcap 1.1.0 and later, the devices on which you can capture are named `usbmonX`, where `X` is the USB bus number. On Linux 2.6.22 and later, the special "usbmon0" interface receives a combined stream of events from all USB buses. In libpcap 1.0.x, the devices were named `usbX`.

#### Simple MITM hardware with Linux

If the USB host is a black-box device such as a game console and you cannot capture USB traffic on the host's operating system, here are two DIY-projects that help you build a simple MITM device to intercept and relay USB messages on the USB cable.

* [SerialUSB](https://github.com/matlo/serialusb)

  is designed to intercept USB HID traffic. Originally made for the GIMX project (which lets you connect PC game controllers to the PS4 by converting the HID protocol messages). You will need a Linux computer to capture the HID messages and an [Arduino-based USB dongle](https://gimx.fr/wiki/index.php?title=DIY_USB_adapter_for_dummies). Parts are cheap. If you don't like soldering, you can buy ready-made "GIMX USB adapters" [from the developer](https://blog.gimx.fr/product/gimx-adapter/) and from enthusiasts on eBay and elsewhere.
* [USBProxy](https://github.com/dominicgs/USBProxy)

  intercepts USB traffic with a standalone Beaglebone Black, which is reconfigured to act as a USB gadget emulating the device connected to the 2nd USB port. Unlike SerialUSB, this solution works with higher-speed non-HID USB traffic as well (within the hardware limitations of the Beaglebone device).

### macOS

Capturing USB traffic on macOS is possible since Wireshark 2.4.0, libpcap 1.9.0, and macOS High Sierra, using the XHC20 interface.

In order to capture on that interface, you will first have to run the command

`ifconfigÂ XHC20Â up`

as root, for example by running

`sudoÂ ifconfigÂ XHC20Â up`

[In macOS Catalina and later releases, you apparently have to disable System Integrity Protection to capture USB traffic](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/124875).

### Windows

You can capture raw USB traffic on Windows with [USBPcap](http://desowin.org/usbpcap/). The [Tools](/Tools) page lists some other options for Windows USB capture.

---

#### A word of warning about USBPcap

There have been problems with using USBPcap in the past, and while these problems ***should*** be resolved now, you may wish to familiarize yourself with these earlier problems, in the event you are still affected by it.

* [Wireshark Bug 11766](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=11766) - USBPcap prevents mouse and keyboard from working
* [USBPcap Issue #3](https://github.com/desowin/usbpcap/issues/3) - Windows 7 - USB bus not recognized after restart after USBPcap installation
* [Microsoft Security Advisory 3033929](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2015/3033929) - Availability of SHA-2 Code Signing Support for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2

---

You can also capture and debug USB traffic on a virtual Windows machine under VirtualBox. In some ways this is more convenient than working with a separate Windows box.

In this example, an embedded Linux device running g\_ether (RNDIS ethernet gadget) connects to Windows. e.g. an NSLU2 with a USB slave modification <http://www.nslu2-linux.org/wiki/HowTo/AddDeviceSideUSBPort> but it should work for almost any USB device.

With this method, Linux recognises the USB device (i.e. >lsusb will still show them), but VirtualBox hooks it into Windows but Wireshark on linux still gets to snoop on all the packets.

Steps:

1. Install a VirtualBox Windows guest on your Linux host. Start up the virtual Windows session.

2. Plug-in the embedded slave device via a USB cable, which itself should be either a device Windows already knows about (or in this case it was running a valid g\_ether gadget stack and needed a .inf file)

3. Run >lsusb and take a note of which bus the device connects.

* e.g
* "Bus 003 Device 003: ID 0525:a4a2 Netchip Technology, Inc. Linux-USB Ethernet/RNDIS Gadget"

4. On linux side,run >ifconfig usb0 down - this prevents both the linux system and the windows system from fighting over the device

5. On the Windows virtual machine, on VirtualBox menus click the checkbox

* [Devices]->Usb devices>[x]Your device
* to let windows see the USB device.

6. Now Windows should recognise the device and proceed with the "plug-and-pray" session for driver initialisation.

I worked from the instructions on <http://docwiki.gumstix.org/index.php/Windows_XP_usbnet> to install the driver.

7. In this example, I had to set up the networking options for IP address, Gateway etc on Windows to match the IP network on the gadget but for other USB device types there will be no extra setup. In any case this is just normal Windows behavior.

8. On Linux, startup Wireshark and using the Bus number given earlier from >lsusb command to sniff for packets.

Hints for developing something like a Windows native "USBPcap": a [kernel mode filter device driver](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa490241.aspx) has to be written. An older [Driver Development Kit (DDK)](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/ddk/default.mspx) is available which at least can compile kernel mode binaries. The most important functions to install the filter driver are [CreateService()](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682450.aspx) and [SetupDiSetDeviceRegistryProperty()](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms792978.aspx) function with SPDRP\_LOWERFILTERS parameter.

## Hardware USB capture

Capturing raw packets as seen on the bus is possible with hardware USB sniffers. The target device is connected through the hardware sniffer in man-in-the-middle style:

* device cable is connected to sniffer USB A port
* another cable is connected from sniffer USB B (or USB C) target device port to target host USB A port

Besides the two cables there is also a third cable from sniffer host USB B (or USB C) port to the capture host. It is recommended that capture host is separate from target host.

Currently there is no USB 3.x capture hardware available with Wireshark support.

### OpenVizsla

[OpenVizsla](https://github.com/openvizslatng/ov_ftdi) contains 32 MiB onboard SDRAM that is useful when capturing high-speed bus with significant saturation. Use [ovextcap](https://github.com/matwey/libopenvizsla) to make OpenVizsla interface available in Wireshark interfaces list.

OpenVizsla is Open Hardware project and can be [assembled manually](https://github.com/OpenVizslaTNG/ov_ftdi/blob/156980dd27ac4c98fa6055fa7009be81a341b079/images/openvizsla_assembly_notes.pdf). Last known place where preassembled units were sold is [sysmocom](https://shop.sysmocom.de/OpenVizsla-v3.x-USB-Protocol-Analyzer-PCBA/openvizsla-pcba-v3.4).

### Low-cost USB Sniffer

[Low-cost USB Sniffer (LS/FS/HS) with Wireshark interface](https://github.com/ataradov/usb-sniffer) is USB 2.0 bus sniffer without onboard RAM. Use [usb sniffer extcap](https://github.com/ataradov/usb-sniffer/tree/main/software) to make USB Sniffer interface available in Wireshark interfaces list.

Schematics are available in KiCad format and the hardware can be assembled manually.

## Discussion

Why was the note about inaccurate time stamps removed?!? - *[UlfLamping](/UlfLamping)*

The timestamps should be ok now since libpcap works around the issue by explicitly calling gettimeofday()- ronnie

Well, the inaccuracies I had in mind was about the "delta" involved between the data is received from the USB device and actually timestamped from the kernel. This delta will be substantially lower for e.g. PCI based nic's than for USB ones - and should be mentioned. Or am I just wrong on this topic and this can be ignored - which should be mentioned then too? - *[UlfLamping](/UlfLamping)*

There's "capturing on USB-attached networking interfaces" and there's "capturing USB traffic"; this page is for the latter, but it sounds as if the time stamp delta is an issue for the former. - *Guy Harris*

**NTFS volume mount points** are specialized [NTFS filesystem](/wiki/NTFS "NTFS") objects which are used to [mount](/wiki/Mount_%28computing%29 "Mount (computing)") and provide an entry point to other [volumes](/wiki/Volume_%28computing%29 "Volume (computing)").

## Description

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NTFS_volume_mount_point&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description")]

NTFS volume mount points are [NTFS filesystem](/wiki/NTFS "NTFS") objects—implemented as [NTFS reparse points](/wiki/NTFS_reparse_point "NTFS reparse point")—which are used to [mount](/wiki/Mount_%28computing%29 "Mount (computing)") and provide an entry point to other [volumes](/wiki/Volume_%28computing%29 "Volume (computing)"). Volume mount points are supported by NTFS 3.0, which was introduced with [Windows 2000](/wiki/Windows_2000 "Windows 2000").

## Use

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=NTFS_volume_mount_point&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Use")]

Mount points can be created in a [directory](/wiki/Directory_%28file_systems%29 "Directory (file systems)") on an NTFS [file system](/wiki/File_system "File system"), which gives a reference to the [root directory](/wiki/Root_directory "Root directory") of the mounted volume. Any empty directory can be converted to a mount point. The mounted volume is not limited to the NTFS filesystem but can be formatted with any file system supported by [Microsoft Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows"). However, though these are similar to POSIX [mount](/wiki/Mount_%28Unix%29 "Mount (Unix)") points found in Unix and Unix-like systems, they only support local filesystems; on [Windows Vista](/wiki/Windows_Vista "Windows Vista") and later versions of Windows, [NTFS symbolic links](/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link "NTFS symbolic link") can be used to link local directories to remote [SMB](/wiki/Server_Message_Block "Server Message Block") network paths.

Symbolic links do not work during early boot, so it's impossible to redirect e.g.:

* \Windows
* \Windows\System32
* \Windows\Config

Nevertheless, it is possible to redirect:

* \Users
* \Documents and Settings
* \Program Files
* \Program Files (x86)

# usbrply

Convert a .pcap file (captured USB packets) to Python or C code that replays the captured USB commands.

Supported packet sources are:

* Linux Wireshark (via usbmon)
* Windows Wireshark (via USBPcap)

Supported output formats are:

* libusb Python (primary)
* (libusb C: fixme)
* (Linux Kernel C: fixme)
* JSON

Example applications:

* Rapidly reverse engineer and re-implement USB protocols
* Record a proprietary Windows programming sequence and replay on an embedded Linux device
* Snoop USB-serial packets

Questions? Please reach out on github or join #usbrply on Freenode IRC

# Linux installation

```
# Do one of these
# Easier to setup, but slower
sudo pip install python-pcapng
# Much faster, but no longer maintained
sudo apt-get install -y python-libpcap
git clone https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply.git
cd usbrply
sudo python setup.py install

```

# Windows installation

There is probably an easier way to do this but this is what I got to work. Tested on Windows 7 x64

Setup python and pip

* Get the latest Python 3 release (<https://www.python.org/downloads/>)
* I used Python 3.7.8 (Windows x86-64 executable installer)
* Keep default setup options (in particular this will install pip)

Install libusb1

* pip install libusb1

Install usb drivers

* Some USB drivers won't replay. You need to switch their USB drivers to WinUSB. You can use Zadig to switch between USB libraries for a single device.
* <https://zadig.akeo.ie/>
* Run Zadig
* Click on **Options** then **List all devices** then select the USB device that doesn't replay properly and **Replace Driver** with WinUSB

Install

* Open a command prompt
  + Default should be your home dir (ex: C:\Users\mcmaster)
* `python -m venv usbrply`
* `usbrply\Scripts\activate.bat`
* `pip install usbrply`

Test

* If not still in venv (prompt like "(usbrply)" ): `usbrply/Scripts/activate.bat`
* `python usbrply\Scripts\usbrply -h`
  + You should get a help message
* Download and place in your home dir: <https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply-test/raw/master/win1.pcapng>
* `python usbply\Scripts\usbrply win1.pcapng`
  + You should see python code that will reproduce the .pcap file commands

# Sample workflows

## Capturing Windows traffic and replaying traffic in Python:

* Install Wireshark. Make sure you install the USBPcap library
* Start Wireshark
* Connect USB device to computer
* Select which USB device you want to capture by clicking on the tiny blue cogwheel and checking the box next to the USB device you want to capture [![usbPcap](/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply/raw/master/docs/usbPcap.png)](/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply/blob/master/docs/usbPcap.png)
* Double click on the USBPcap to start the capture
* Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Close application
* Stop capture
* Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
* Close Wireshark
* Run: `usbrply --wrapper --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py`
* Assuming your usb device is connected to the computer, go to "Device manager", find your device, right click on it, select "Properties", go to "Details" tab, select "Hardware IDs" from the drop-down, and you will find an entry of a form: HID\VID\_046D&PID\_C05A For this example the vid is 0x046D and the pid is 0xC05A
* Scroll down to the bottom of replay.py and edit the following line:

```
        if (vid, pid) == (**0x0000**, **0x0000**):

```

* Example edited line:

```
        if (vid, pid) == (**0x046D**, **0xC05A**):

```

* Linux: run `python replay.py`
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

## Capturing Windows VM traffic from Linux host and replaying traffic in Python:

Example: program a Xilinx dev board under Linux without knowing anything about the JTAG adapter USB protocol

* On Linux host:
  + Install Wireshark
  + Enable usbmon so Wireshark can capture USB (e.g. `sudo modprobe usbmon`, see <http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB>)
  + Boot Windows VM (ie through VMWare)
  + Start Wireshark. Make sure you have USB permissions (ie you may need to sudo)
  + Connect USB device to computer
  + Use lsusb to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
  + Start catpure on bus from above
  + Attach USB device to Windows guest
* On Windows guest:
  + Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Back on Linux host:
  + Stop capture in Wireshark.
  + Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
  + Run: `usbrply --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py`
  + Detatch USB device from Windows guest
  + Run `python replay.py`
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

## Capturing from Linux Terminal

* Install tshark
* Enable usbmon so tshark can capture USB (e.g. `sudo modprobe usbmon`, see <http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB>)
* Connect USB device to computer
* Use `lsusb` to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
* Start capturing using tshark like: `tshark -i usbmon1 -w capture.pcapng`
  + The usbmon device matches the bus number output from `lsusb` e.g. a device entry starting with `Bus 001 Device 002` would be captured from `usbmon1`.
* Use the device as desired.
* Stop capturing by hitting Ctrl-C.
* Run: `usbrply --device-hi -p capture.pcapng > replay.py`

# Command Line Options

You may need to filter out USB devices. There are two ways to do this:

* `--device-hi`: use the last device enumerated. This works well in most cases, including FX2 renumeration
* `--device DEVICE`: manually specify the USB device used. Get this from lsusb output or Wireshark view

Other useful switches:

* `--rel-pkt`: intended to easier allow diffing two outputs. Ex: what changed in trace for LED on vs LED off?
* `--no-packet-numbers`: alternative to above
* `--fx2`: decode common FX2 commands (ex: CPU reset)
* `--range RANGE`: only decode a specific packet range. Use along with Wireshark GUI or refine a previous decode
* see `--help` for more

# JSON output

use -j switch to output a parsing intermediate representation that should resemble original USB requests
along with associated metadata.
This can be used in more advanced applications, such as if you need to decode a complicated protocol
or convert USB output to higher level API calls.
An example can be found here: <https://github.com/ProgHQ/bpmicro/blob/master/scrape.py>
This example first aggregates USB packets into application specific packets, and then decodes these into API calls

# USB serial decoder

usbrply-serial supported adapters:

* FT2232C: data rx/tx

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```
