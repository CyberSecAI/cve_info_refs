Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43435:

**CVE-2022-43435**

*   **Vulnerability:**  The 360 FireLine Plugin for Jenkins allows disabling the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header for static files.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin, in versions 1.7.2 and earlier, disables the CSP header when the 'Execute FireLine' build step is executed and the 'Open access to HTML with JS or CSS' option is checked. This is because the plugin modifies the header, removing vital protections.
*   **Weaknesses:** The plugin provides an option that bypasses a critical security mechanism (CSP) intended to protect against XSS attacks.
*   **Impact:** This allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, or `/userContent` can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker needs to configure a Jenkins job using the 360 FireLine plugin and enable the option to open access to HTML with JS or CSS. They also need control over files served as static content by Jenkins (workspaces, archived artifacts etc.) in order to inject malicious content.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs at least Item/Configure permission to create/modify jobs to use the 360 FireLine plugin and enable the vulnerable setting and also the ability to control files served by Jenkins to inject malicious code.
*   **Affected Versions:** 360 FireLine Plugin 1.7.2 and earlier.
*   **Mitigation:** There is no fix at the time of the advisory.  The advisory suggests that Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected, but this is not a mitigation for the vulnerability itself.
