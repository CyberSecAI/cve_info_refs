Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43958:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- User credentials are stored in plaintext within the database. There is no hashing or other cryptographic mechanism employed to protect the passwords.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Passwords (CWE-256):** User passwords are not encrypted or hashed when stored in the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who gains access to the database can read user credentials.
- This allows the attacker to impersonate other users.
- Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Access to the database is required to extract the plaintext credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the database where the credentials are stored. This could be through a variety of means, such as network access or a database breach.
- The CVSS vector indicates that an attacker needs to have local access.

**Additional Notes:**
- Siemens recommends updating to version V12.39 or later to address this issue.
-  A workaround of enabling password encryption is suggested.
- This advisory is also present as part of a broader advisory covering multiple vulnerabilities.
