{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak occurs in the UPF (User Plane Function) of Open5gs due to improper handling of PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) connections. Specifically, `pfcp_node` structures are allocated when new PFCP connections are established, but they are not freed after use or upon errors. These nodes are only freed when UPF terminates.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to not freeing allocated pfcp nodes after use.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). When more than 64 PFCP connections are made, the `ogs_pfcp_node_pool`, which is limited to 64 entries, will be exhausted, leading to UPF crashing, and disrupting network services.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending more than 64 invalid PFCP packets through different sockets.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send PFCP packets to the target Open5gs UPF instance."
