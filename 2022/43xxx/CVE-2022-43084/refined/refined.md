Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

* **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts. Specifically, the `v_name` parameter in the `/admin/admin-add-vehicle.php` endpoint is vulnerable.
* **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization/validation on the `v_name` parameter.
* **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A crafted POST request to `/admin/admin-add-vehicle.php` containing a malicious script in the `v_name` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. An attacker with access to the admin panel could directly exploit this vulnerability, or it could be triggered by a less privileged user depending on how the application handles the input later on.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   Vulnerable Parameter: `v_name`
    *   Vulnerable File: `/admin/admin-add-vehicle.php`
    *   Payload: `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
    *   The application is a Vehicle Booking System in PHP (v1.0)
