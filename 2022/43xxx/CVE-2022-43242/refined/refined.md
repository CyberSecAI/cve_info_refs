  "CVE-2022-43242": {
    "root_cause": "Heap-buffer-overflow in the `mc_luma<unsigned char>` function within motion.cc.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-buffer-overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability could potentially allow for arbitrary code execution, but this is not explicitly stated. The main impact is crashing the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted video file"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted video file to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required.",
    "additional_details": "The issue was discovered in `libde265` v1.0.8. The vulnerability occurs when processing motion compensation with the `mc_luma` function. AddressSanitizer output shows a heap-buffer-overflow during a read operation, and a crash occurs. Specific proof-of-concept video files (poc6-1, poc6-2) trigger the issue. A patch was created that makes the failures go away by using the SPS from the image, however, further investigation and patches are required to ensure it is fully corrected."
