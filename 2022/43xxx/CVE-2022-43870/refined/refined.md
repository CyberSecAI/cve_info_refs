- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SNMPv3 server credentials are being logged in plaintext within system and audit logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of sensitive information (SNMPv3 credentials) in system logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Any authenticated user with access to the system and audit logs can read the plaintext SNMPv3 credentials, potentially allowing them to gain unauthorized access or control over systems managed by SNMP.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated user must have access to the system or audit logs to read the plaintext credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the system or audit logs.
