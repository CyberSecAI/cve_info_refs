- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `GetReturnCallDropKeepCount` function within `binary-reader-interp.cc` when processing a `return_call_indirect` instruction. This happens because the code accesses a `std::vector` using an index that is larger than the vector's size. Specifically, the crash occurs in `std::vector<wabt::Type, std::allocator<wabt::Type>>::size()` when trying to access the vector size in the `GetReturnCallDropKeepCount` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the WebAssembly Binary Toolkit (wabt) during the interpretation of a crafted WebAssembly binary.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to a segmentation fault (SEGV) and program termination due to an invalid memory access. In the provided context, this is observed when running `wasm-interp` on a malicious `.wasm` file.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a specific WebAssembly binary (like `poc-interp-3.wasm`), an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read when the binary is processed by the `wabt` interpreter. The vulnerability is triggered when the `OnReturnCallIndirectExpr` function calls `GetReturnCallDropKeepCount`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted WebAssembly binary to the `wabt` interpreter.
