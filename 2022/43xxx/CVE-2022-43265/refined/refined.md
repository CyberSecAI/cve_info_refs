Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper file type validation and sanitization in the `/assets/pages/save_user.php` file of the Canteen Management System. The system directly saves the uploaded file based on the provided name without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The system allows any file type to be uploaded, including executable files like PHP scripts.
- **Lack of File Type Validation:** There is no check to ensure the uploaded file is an image as intended.
- **Direct File Saving:** The code directly saves the uploaded file using the name provided in the request, without sanitizing or validating it, which allows an attacker to upload a malicious file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can potentially lead to a full compromise of the system, data breach, or denial of service.
- **OS Command Execution:** Successfully uploaded and executed malicious PHP script can execute OS commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted `multipart/form-data` HTTP request to `/assets/pages/save_user.php` with a malicious PHP file disguised as an image.
- **File Upload:** The `image` parameter in the POST request is the attack vector, through which a malicious file is sent to the vulnerable script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server where the vulnerable Canteen Management System is hosted.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:**  The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending HTTP POST requests with multipart form data.
- **Basic understanding of HTTP requests and PHP:** The attacker needs to have an understanding of how to craft a file upload request and basic knowledge about php to craft the malicious file.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerable code snippet from `/assets/pages/save_user.php` is as follows:
```php
$image = $_FILES['image']['name'];
$target = "../uploadImage/Profile/".basename($image);
if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES['image']['tmp_name'], $target)) {
    $msg = "Image uploaded successfully";
}else{
    $msg = "Failed to upload image";
}
```
The code takes the name of the uploaded file from the `$_FILES['image']['name']` variable, constructs the target path using `basename()` function and saves the uploaded file to the server using `move_uploaded_file()`. There are no checks to validate the content or extension of the file before saving it.

**Additional Information**
The provided step to reproduce using `curl` command demonstrates a basic file upload attack, where the attacker uploads a file named `evil.php` to the vulnerable endpoint. The server responds with an error due to the file upload logic.
```
curl -I -F "image=@evil.php" "http://www.example.com/assets/pages/save_user.php"
```
