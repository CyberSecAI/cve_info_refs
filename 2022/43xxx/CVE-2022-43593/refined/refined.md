  "cve": "CVE-2022-43593",
  "description": "A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DPXOutput::close() functionality of OpenImageIO Project OpenImageIO v2.4.4.2. A specially crafted ImageOutput Object can lead to null pointer dereference. An attacker can provide malicious input to trigger this vulnerability.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "OpenImageIO Project OpenImageIO v2.4.4.2",
    "< 2.4.6.0"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference in the `DPXOutput::close()` function when writing a `.dpx` file.  The `m_buf` buffer is not always initialized which leads to a null pointer dereference when `m_dpx.WriteElement` is called.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Null Pointer Dereference"
  ],
  "impact": "Denial of service (application crash).",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Specially crafted image file or specification that is then used to generate an ImageOutput object."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "Attacker must be able to control the input file or specification used to generate an `ImageOutput` object."
  ],
  "additional_info": "The vulnerability occurs when the output specification has a `.tile_width` and a specific number of channels (2 or 5-8) such that `dpx::QueryNativeBufferSize` returns 0. This causes `m_buf` not to be allocated and eventually leads to a crash."
