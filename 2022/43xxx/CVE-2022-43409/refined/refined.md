Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43409:

**CVE-2022-43409**

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Plugin:** Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 838.va\_3a\_087b\_4055b and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not sanitize or properly encode URLs of hyperlinks added to build logs. These hyperlinks, which send POST requests when clicked, are used by other plugins such as Pipeline: Input Step Plugin to handle user interactions (e.g., proceed or abort)
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper URL sanitization/encoding.
    *   Lack of input validation on URLs used in hyperlinks in build logs.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
     * Attackers can create a malicious pipeline that generates build logs containing crafted hyperlinks with malicious JavaScript code. When a user views the build log and clicks on the crafted link, the attacker's JavaScript code is executed within the user's browser session in the context of the Jenkins web application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to create pipelines.
    *   Ability to view build logs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser session, potentially leading to:
        *   Session hijacking.
        *   Information disclosure.
        *   Malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.
*   **Fix:** Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 839.v35e2736cfd5c properly encodes URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.
