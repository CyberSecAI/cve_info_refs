- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software does not properly secure a folder containing library files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427). The system loads DLLs from an insecure folder.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges by placing a malicious DLL in the insecure folder. The malicious DLL will be executed when a service is started that requires the DLL.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker must have local access to the system to place the malicious DLL in the vulnerable folder.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges and must be able to write files to a specific folder on the target system.
