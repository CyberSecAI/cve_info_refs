- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zabbix agent installer (MSI) incorrectly creates a Windows Firewall rule that allows all incoming TCP connections from any source to all programs and ports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The installer creates an overly permissive firewall rule instead of restricting access to the specific agent port.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can connect to any TCP service running on the machine where the Zabbix agent is installed. This could allow for unauthorized access to internal services, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can connect to the vulnerable host over the network due to the overly permissive firewall rule.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the machine with the vulnerable Zabbix agent installed.
