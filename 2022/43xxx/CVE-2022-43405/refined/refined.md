Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-43405:

**CVE-2022-43405**

*   **Root Cause:** This vulnerability stems from improper handling of sandbox-generated synthetic constructors within the `library` step of the Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin. This allows the instantiation of any subclassable type via crafted untrusted libraries.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The `library` step in vulnerable versions can be exploited to invoke sandbox-generated synthetic constructors from untrusted libraries.
    *   This allows construction of arbitrary subclassable types, bypassing intended sandbox restrictions.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with the ability to define untrusted Pipeline libraries and execute sandboxed Pipelines can bypass the sandbox protections. This leads to arbitrary code execution within the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Attackers need to define untrusted Pipeline libraries.
    *   Attackers need the ability to define and run sandboxed Pipelines.
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by using the `library` step to load and instantiate classes from these crafted libraries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to define untrusted Pipeline libraries.
    *   Permission to define and run sandboxed Pipelines.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The description indicates this is similar to a previously addressed vulnerability (SECURITY-582), but in a different plugin.
*   The fix involves rejecting improper calls to synthetic constructors when using the `library` step.
*   The Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin has removed the problematic `library` step and moved it to the Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin.
