```
**Vulnerability:** Content-Security-Policy bypass
**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-43434
**Affected Plugin:** NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin
**Affected Versions:** 1.20 and earlier
**Root cause:** The plugin disables the Content-Security-Policy header for static files.
**Weakness:** The plugin globally disables the Content-Security-Policy header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step is executed.
**Impact of exploitation:** This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.
**Attack vector:** An attacker needs to be able to control files in workspaces or archived artifacts and trigger a build using the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step.
**Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to control files in workspaces or archived artifacts, and ability to trigger a build using the affected build step.
**Note:** Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.
