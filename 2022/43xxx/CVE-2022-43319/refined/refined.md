Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `vcs/downloadFiles.php` script of the "Simple E-Learning System" v1.0. The script uses a `download` parameter without proper sanitization or validation, allowing for arbitrary file access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Path Traversal (File Disclosure):** The application is vulnerable to path traversal due to the lack of input sanitization on the `download` parameter of `vcs/downloadFiles.php`. This allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server file system using relative path traversal sequences like `../`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
*   In the examples provided the attacker was able to read `/etc/passwd` and `search.php`.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET request:** The attack is performed by crafting a GET request to `vcs/downloadFiles.php` with a malicious `download` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   No authentication appears to be required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
* The provided content includes example payloads such as:
    * `vcs/downloadFiles.php?download=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`
    * `vcs/downloadFiles.php?download=./search.php`
* The content includes screenshots of the successful exploitation of the vulnerability.

This information provides more detail than the typical CVE description, which often lacks specific vulnerable file paths, example payloads, and screenshots.
