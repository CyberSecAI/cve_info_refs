The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Fast Food Ordering System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `purchase.php` file, specifically within the "Order - Save" function. The application fails to properly sanitize user input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information leakage. An attacker can potentially read, modify, or delete sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via an HTTP POST request to the `purchase.php` endpoint with a malicious payload in the `customer` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `purchase.php` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to understand the application's workflow to inject the payload when saving an order.
