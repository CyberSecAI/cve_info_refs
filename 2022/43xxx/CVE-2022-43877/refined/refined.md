- **Root cause of vulnerability:** If the `agentrelay.properties` configuration file is manually edited using a plain text value, the value may not be automatically encrypted as expected after restarting the service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive password information can be disclosed due to the failure to encrypt plain text values in the `agentrelay.properties` file after manual edits and service restarts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of sensitive password information.
- **Attack vectors:** Local editing of the `agentrelay.properties` file with a plain text value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manually edit the `agentrelay.properties` file on the system.
