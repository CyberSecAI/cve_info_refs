{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/youthappam/editcategory.php` file before using it in an SQL query.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `editcategory.php` file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially gain access to the database, retrieve sensitive information, modify or delete data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious SQL query injected into the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific prior authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. Access to the application's URL is needed."
