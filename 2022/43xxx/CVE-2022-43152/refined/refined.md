The provided content is related to CVE-2022-43152.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in `BitStreamWriter::flushBits()` and `BitStreamReader::getCurVal()` within the tsMuxer project.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `BitStreamWriter::flushBits()` at `/home/hjsz/fuzz_software/tsMuxer-master/tsMuxer/bitStream.h:224:37`
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `BitStreamReader::getCurVal()` at `/home/hjsz/fuzz_software/tsMuxer-master/tsMuxer/bitStream.h:60:20`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash due to heap-buffer-overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution, although not explicitly stated in the provided content

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted input file that triggers the overflow during bitstream writing or reading.
- Fuzzing was used to discover these vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a crafted input file that would be processed by tsMuxer to trigger the overflow.
- No special privileges are explicitly mentioned as a requirement, it is assumed that the attacker would be in a position where they can supply input to the application.
