Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43479:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is an open redirect issue. This occurs because the application doesn't properly validate the `ref` parameter in the login and redirect URLs, allowing an attacker to specify an arbitrary URL for redirection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Open Redirect (CWE-601):** The application accepts a `ref` parameter in URLs like `https://www.example.jp/.mypage/login?ref=https://xxxx` and `https://www.example.jp/.mypage/redirect?ref=https://xxxx` and `https://www.example.jp/.g1/schedule?calendar%5Bpath%5D=https://xxx` without sufficient validation, allowing redirection to an attacker-controlled site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** By crafting a malicious URL that includes a legitimate site's domain and redirecting to a malicious site, an attacker can trick users into entering credentials on a fraudulent page, leading to credential theft.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** An attacker crafts a URL containing a legitimate site's domain with a manipulated `ref` parameter that redirects to a malicious site. This URL is then distributed to victims through various means (e.g., phishing emails, social media).
* **User Interaction:** A user needs to click on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **External:** The attacker does not require any special access to the application. They only need to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice the victim to click on it.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The user does not need to be logged in to be redirected to the malicious site.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** SHIRASAGI v1.14.4 to v1.15.0
*   **Solution:** Upgrade to SHIRASAGI v1.16.0 or later.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by using the `ref` parameter in the login URL, redirect URL, and schedule calendar path.
