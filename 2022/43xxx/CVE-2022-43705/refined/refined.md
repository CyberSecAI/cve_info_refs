The provided content is related to CVE-2022-43705.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient verification of OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) responses within the Botan library. Specifically, Botan versions 2.19.2 and earlier fail to properly verify if an authorized responder certificate, embedded in an OCSP response, is actually authorized by the issuing Certificate Authority (CA).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of OCSP responses
- Failure to verify if an OCSP responder certificate is authorized by the issuing CA.
- Allows any valid signature from an embedded certificate to pass the check, potentially making claims about the revocation status of certificates from any CA.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker in a position to spoof OCSP responses can:
   - Render legitimate certificates of a third-party CA as revoked.
   - Use a compromised (and revoked) certificate by spoofing an "OK" OCSP response.
   - Impersonate legitimate TLS servers by using compromised certificates and bypassing revocation checks via OCSP stapling.
   - Potentially gain access or perform actions by impersonating a trusted entity using compromised certificates.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, where an attacker can intercept or spoof OCSP responses.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or spoof OCSP responses for a client.
- The attacker would need to be able to craft malicious OCSP responses.
- The attacker would need to be able to present a compromised certificate.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Botan version 1.11.34 (November 2016)
- The issue is mitigated in Botan version 2.19.3, with a comprehensive fix planned for Botan 3.0.0.
- The provided code snippet suggests a workaround by manually verifying OCSP responses are signed by the legitimate CA.
- Users not relying on OCSP are not affected. Switching to CRLs could be a temporary workaround.
