    "description": "Libde265 v1.0.8 was discovered to contain a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability via put_epel_hv_fallback in fallback-motion.cc. This vulnerability allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) via a crafted video file.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a heap-buffer-overflow in the `put_epel_hv_fallback` function in `fallback-motion.cc`. This function is used for motion compensation and is triggered when processing a crafted video file with specific parameters.",
