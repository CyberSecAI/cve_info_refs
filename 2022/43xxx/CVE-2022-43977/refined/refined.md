- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The debug port (qconn service) is accessible via TCP without any access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unprotected and open debug service (qconn) accessible via TCP. Lack of access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Complete compromise of the system with high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack. The vulnerable debug port is accessible via TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No privileges are required; an attacker needs network access to the device.
