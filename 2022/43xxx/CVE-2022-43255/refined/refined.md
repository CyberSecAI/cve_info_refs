{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Memory leaks occur in several functions when parsing a crafted XMT file. Specifically, the leaks are triggered in `gf_odf_new_iod`, `gf_odf_new_esd`, `gf_odf_new_dcd` and `gf_list_new` during the processing of XMT files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "impact": "The memory leak can lead to a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting available memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted XMT file can be provided as input to the MP4Box tool.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted XMT file as input to MP4Box."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted XMT file, specifically during the processing of elements related to  `gf_odf_new_iod`, `gf_odf_new_esd`, `gf_odf_new_dcd`, and list creation functions. The ASAN output provides the exact locations of the memory leaks."
