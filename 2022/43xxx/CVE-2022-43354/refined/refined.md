Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `/php-sms/admin/?page=orders/manage_request` URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: Specifically, the vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability because the application directly embeds the user-supplied `id` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Information Disclosure: The provided exploit uses `updatexml` function to extract database name `(select database())`, indicating the attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to `/php-sms/admin/?page=orders/manage_request` with a malicious SQL injection payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target application.
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated based on provided details as the URL is accessible to the public. However, access to the admin page is mentioned but not directly tied to the exploit.

**Additional Details**
- Vulnerable File: `/php-sms/admin/?page=orders/manage_request&id=`
- The example shows how to inject SQL using `updatexml` function: `id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
- The vulnerable application is described as "Sanitization Management System v1.0 by oretnom23".
- The database name is `sms_db`.
- Login credentials for a super admin account are provided "admin/admin123".
