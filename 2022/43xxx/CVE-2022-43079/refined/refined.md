The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Train Scheduler App v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the `destination` parameter when adding a new schedule.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
