- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing PCX files, leading to a write past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a user opening a malicious PCX file or visiting a malicious webpage containing such a file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to craft a malicious PCX file. User interaction is required, as the target must either open the malicious file or visit a webpage containing it.
