The provided content details a vulnerability in Dedecms v5.7.101, specifically a file upload vulnerability that leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This vulnerability is a bypass of a previous patch for CVE-2022-40886.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from insufficient filtering of uploaded file content in `/dede/file_manage_control.php`, specifically a bypass of the `uploadsafe.inc.php` protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Inadequate regular expression filtering in `uploadsafe.inc.php`. The regex `[$][_0-9a-z]+[\s]*[(][\s\S]*[)][\s]*[;]` blocks many malicious code patterns but can be bypassed by shell injection using `<?php ?>` tags.
- The system fails to properly sanitize or block malicious PHP code embedded within uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- This leads to full compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- File upload functionality within the backend of Dedecms.
- Uploading a crafted PHP file containing malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid backend access credentials to upload files.
- No specific network position is mentioned, but access to the system's web interface is required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability bypasses the regex filter in `uploadsafe.inc.php`.
- The provided exploit uses a PHP payload that constructs and executes the `system` function with the `calc` command (used as a proof-of-concept).
- The `system` function call is constructed by string concatenation to bypass the regex filters.
- The specific PHP code used for exploitation is:
  ```php
  <?php $x='sys';$xx='tem';$xxx=$x.$xx;$y='di';$yy='r';$yyy=$y.$yy;$xxx($yyy) ?>
  ```

This content provides details about a specific bypass of security measures implemented to address CVE-2022-40886, which is an RCE vulnerability in Dedecms. It clearly shows how the regular expression can be bypassed using specific PHP syntax, enabling remote code execution.
