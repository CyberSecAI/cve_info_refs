In addition to advanced management functions, # its Power over Ethernet (PoE) ports allow data and power traffic over # the same network cable, providing power and connectivity for cameras and IP # phones, wireless access points, and other compatible devices. the IEEE 802.3at # and IEEE 802.3af standards."## "The SG 2404 MR offers a number of management features that give the operator greater # control over the network with high performance and stability. The GUI web interface # facilitates its configuration, which can also be performed via command line console # port (CLI). With the SG 2404 MR it is possible to monitor the devices connected via # SNMP protocol for greater security and control of network devices, as well as to # create Quality of Service (QoS) rules to guarantee quality of packet traffic # prioritizing data applications, voice , video and bandwidth control."## "The switch can also create Access Control Lists (ACLs) to filter out unwanted content # on the network, and can also segment the network into up to 4,000 subnets (VLANs). # These and other functions provide greater reliability to the operation and maximize # network availability time "## Source: http://www.intelbras.com.br/empresarial/redes-opticas-e-cabeadas/switches/gerenciaveis/sg-2404-poe # ------- http://www.intelbras.com.br/empresarial/redes-opticas-e-cabeadas/switches/gerenciaveis/sg-2404-mr## Vulnerability overview: # ----------------------# The SG 2404 switch web manager contains a login form to authenticate a user, and offers# two levels of privileges: Guest user (level 0) and administator (level 1) which is specified# on usertype parameter. An authenticated attacker which have a guest user could create an another user with# administrative privilege, thus achieving the desired level of authorization because no further## By: vesp3r (vitorespf@gmail.com) #===========================================================================================================================
Originally the request to add users belongs only to administrative users, but with the guest userwe can replicate the same request to create privileged users.
Steps to reproduce the vulnerability:
1- Copy yours "guest" user cookie value to "\_tid\_" parameter.2- Change the "username" and "pwd" paramater.3- Set usertype to 1 (administrator user)4- After sending the request, the user "test" will be created.5- Login with your administrative user.
