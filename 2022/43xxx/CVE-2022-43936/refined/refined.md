- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Brocade SANnav versions before v2.2.2 improperly expose Brocade Fabric OS switch passwords in logs when debugging is enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cleartext storage of sensitive information (switch passwords) in logs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local or remote authenticated privileged user with access to logs may gain access to switch users' passwords. This could lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected switches.
- **Attack vectors:** Access to the logs generated by the Brocade SANnav application. This could be either local access to the server or remote access if the logs are exposed through some interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires an authenticated privileged user with access to the logs where the passwords have been written.
