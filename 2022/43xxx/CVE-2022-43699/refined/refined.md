{
  "CVE-2022-43699": {
    "root_cause": "The external E-Mail autodiscovery feature performs connections checks based on the E-Mail addresses host-part, and does not respect existing deny-lists.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "Server-initiated requests can be directed to internal resources that are restricted based on deny-list settings. This can be used to determine \"internal\" addresses and services, depending on measurement and content of error responses. While no data of such services can be exfiltrated, the risk is a violation of perimeter based security policies.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with access to DNS records of a domain can redirect requests to illegal addresses using the email autodiscovery feature.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires access to DNS records of a domain. They also need to have a valid user account to trigger the email autodiscovery feature."
