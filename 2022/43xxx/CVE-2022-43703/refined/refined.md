The provided content is related to CVE-2022-43703.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Uncontrolled search path element in some Arm DS for Intel® SoC FPGA installation software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The software does not properly control the search path, allowing for potential hijacking of the execution flow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated user can potentially achieve privilege escalation via local access. This could lead to complete system compromise by a malicious user.

**Attack vectors:**
Local access is required. The attacker would need to manipulate the search path to inject malicious executables or libraries that would be loaded during the execution of the Arm DS for Intel® SoC FPGA software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must have local access to the system and possess the ability to modify the search path.
