The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Barangay Management System v1.0 by itsourcecode.com.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `hidden_id` parameter when processing requests to `/bmis/pages/clearance/clearance.php`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use SQL injection to read sensitive data, modify database records, or even potentially gain control of the server. In this specific example, the attacker extracts the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user sends a crafted POST request to `/bmis/pages/clearance/clearance.php` with the `hidden_id` parameter containing malicious SQL code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
