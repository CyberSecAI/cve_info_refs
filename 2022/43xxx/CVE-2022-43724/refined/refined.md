- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software transmits database credentials for the built-in SQL server in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (database credentials). The xp_cmdshell feature is also enabled by default which can be used for command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute custom OS commands due to the cleartext credentials and the enabled xp_cmdshell feature.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected software. The attacker does not need to authenticate to the software. User interaction is required to some extent as the CVSS vector indicates UI:R.
