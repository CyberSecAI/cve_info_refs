- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `GetAttributeList` function of the OpENer library, where the `attribute_count_request` value, extracted from the EtherNet/IP request, is used as the upper bound of a loop. This value is not validated against the available response buffer size. Inside this loop, data is written to the response buffer using `AddIntToMessage`. When `attribute_count_request` is set to a large value, the `current_message_position` goes beyond the bounds of the response buffer. Subsequently, `AddIntToMessage` writes user-supplied data outside of the buffer, leading to out-of-bounds write.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write due to lack of validation of user-controlled input (`attribute_count_request`).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the server. Furthermore, this out-of-bounds write can be leveraged for remote code execution by corrupting the stack with controlled data.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending specially crafted EtherNet/IP requests with a large `attribute_count_request` value.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send EtherNet/IP requests to the target device running the vulnerable OpENer library.
