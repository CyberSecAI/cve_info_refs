To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: AIX is vulnerable to a denial of service due to lpd (CVE-2022-43382)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

UPDATED Mar 17 (Corrected the affected upper fileset levels for AIX 7.1 TL5 to show that SP11 is affected. Corrected the affected upper fileset levels for AIX 7.3 TL0 to show that SP03 is affected. Added iFixes for 7.1 TL5 SP10 and 7.3 TL0 SP03.) A vulnerability in the AIX lpd printer daemon could allow a local user with elevated privileges to cause a denial of service (CVE-2022-43382). The lpd daemon is the remote print server on AIX.

**B. FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

The fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes. If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM AIX Support at <https://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

**C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION**

Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression testing but not the full regression testing that takes place for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html>

To preview an interim fix installation:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -p # where ipkg\_name is the name of the

# interim fix package being previewed.

To install an interim fix package:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -X # where ipkg\_name is the name of the

# interim fix package being installed.

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
