- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An attacker with site user privileges could replace the `bin/unixcat` executable within a Checkmk site directory with a malicious one. The Checkmk agent, running as root, would then execute this malicious binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation due to insecure execution of user-controlled binaries by a privileged process (the Checkmk agent). Specifically, the agent was executing `unixcat` from a user-writable path.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the Checkmk server. This can lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, system manipulation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the Checkmk server, requiring site user privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to log into the Checkmk server as a site user and have write access to the site's `bin` directory.
