Previously to this Werk an attacker who could become a site user could replace the sites bin/unixcat by a custom executable.
The Checkmk agent would then run it as root.

With this Werk the agent now always calls one of the shipped unixcats below /omd/versions/.

All maintained versions (>=1.6) are subject to this vulnerability. It is likely that also previous versions were vulnerable.

To check against possible exploitation make sure that the sites directory ~MySite/bin points to /omd/versions/MySitesVersion/bin.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H 8.8

We assigned CVE-2022-43440 to this vulnerability.

We thank Jan-Philipp Litza (PLUTEX GmbH) for bringing this to our attention.
