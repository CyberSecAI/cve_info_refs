To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: AIX is vulnerable to a denial of service due to the AIX SMB client (CVE-2022-43381)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability in the AIX SMB client daemon could allow a non-privileged local user to cause a denial of service (CVE-2022-43381). AIX uses the SMB client daemon to access files on SMB servers.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2022-43381](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-43381)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| AIX | 7.1 |
| AIX | 7.2 |
| AIX | 7.3 |
| VIOS | 3.1 |

The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

| Fileset | Lower Level | Upper Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| smbc.rte | 7.1.0.0 | 7.1.302.8 |
| smbc.rte | 7.2.0.0 | 7.2.302.8 |

To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following commands:

lslpp -L | grep -i smbc.rte

## Remediation/Fixes

**FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

The fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/smbcd\_fix2.tar

<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/smbcd_fix2.tar>

<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/smbcd_fix2.tar>

The latest SMB client fileset may also be downloaded from:

<https://www.ibm.com/resources/mrs/assets?source=aixbp>

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

For AIX 7.1:

tar xvf smbcd\_fix2.tar

gunzip smbc\_302\_fileset\_71.tar.gz | tar xvf

For AIX 7.2, 7.3, and VIOS 3.1:

tar xvf smbcd\_fix2.tar

gunzip smbc\_302\_fileset\_72.tar.gz | tar xvf

IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created. Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

To preview the fix installation:

installp -apYd . smbc

To install the fix package:

installp -aXYd . smbc

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [file]" command as the following:

| openssl dgst -sha256 | filename |
| --- | --- |
| 261e08badda1c179e487c2ee20b772cea526a9868a3fd9a8b5c66479a7cb95ca | smbc\_302\_fileset\_71.tar.gz |
| e99d99ce8336a61a888c826c43a97869f3a2df8fcacd59b141770b5ad98a86fc | smbc\_302\_fileset\_72.tar.gz |

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes. If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM AIX Support at <https://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [fix\_file].sig [fix\_file]

Published advisory OpenSSL signature file location:

## Disclaimer

According to the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an "industry open standard designed to convey vulnerability severity and help to determine urgency and priority of response." IBM PROVIDES THE CVSS SCORES ""AS IS"" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. CUSTOMERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF ANY ACTUAL OR POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY. In addition to other efforts to address potential vulnerabilities, IBM periodically updates the record of components contained in our product offerings. As part of that effort, if IBM identifies previously unidentified packages in a product/service inventory, we address relevant vulnerabilities regardless of CVE date. Inclusion of an older CVEID does not demonstrate that the referenced product has been used by IBM since that date, nor that IBM was aware of a vulnerability as of that date. We are making clients aware of relevant vulnerabilities as we become aware of them. "Affected Products and Versions" referenced in IBM Security Bulletins are intended to be only products and versions that are supported by IBM and have not passed their end-of-support or warranty date. Thus, failure to reference unsupported or extended-support products and versions in this Security Bulletin does not constitute a determination by IBM that they are unaffected by the vulnerability. Reference to one or more unsupported versions in this Security Bulletin shall not create an obligation for IBM to provide fixes for any unsupported or extended-support products or versions.
