## D-Link DIR-1935 SetSysEmailSettings Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-1500ZDI-CAN-16149

| CVE ID | [CVE-2022-43629](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-43629) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [D-Link](https://www.dlink.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | DIR-1935 |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of D-Link DIR-1935 routers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of SetSysEmailSettings requests to the web management portal. When parsing subelements within the SetSysEmailSettings element, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | D-Link has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
