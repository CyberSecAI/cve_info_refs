- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure communication is used in TLS connections within IBM Spectrum Scale Data Access Services (DAS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from insecure communication in TLS connections. The specific nature of the insecurity is not detailed but it involves TLS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The specific impact of exploitation is not stated but the vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access or data compromise due to the insecure TLS communication.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via the vulnerable TLS connections within the Data Access Services (DAS) component of IBM Spectrum Scale.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or interact with the vulnerable TLS connections. The exact capabilities are not explicitly defined, but it would involve an ability to exploit the insecure TLS communication.
