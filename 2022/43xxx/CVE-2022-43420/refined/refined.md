*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who can control or modify Contrast service API responses can inject malicious scripts into the generated report, which will be executed when viewed by other users.
