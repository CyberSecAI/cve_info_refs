Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-43595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Infinite Recursion:** The vulnerability stems from a recursive call within the `FitsOutput::write_scanline` function which leads to a stack overflow.
*   **Conditional Close:** The `FitsOutput::write_scanline` function checks if `y > m_spec.height`. If this condition is true, it calls `close()` which triggers `ImageOutput::write_scanlines` again, then `FitsOutput::write_scanline`, leading to infinite recursion and a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Recursive Function Call:** The vulnerability arises from an uncontrolled recursive function call within the `FitsOutput` class.
*   **Lack of Proper Input Validation:** Input specifications that lead to the `y > m_spec.height` condition are not handled correctly.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability causes a stack overflow, resulting in a crash of the application using the library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a denial of service due to a stack overflow. The application processing the malformed image will crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Image File:** An attacker can create a malicious image file (e.g., `.fits`) with specific metadata that, when processed by OpenImageIO, triggers the recursive call and leads to the stack overflow.
*   **Controlled Input:** The attacker needs to control the input file or specification that is then used to generate an `ImageOutput` object with a tile width.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input File:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file or control the image processing parameters used to generate an output file.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `FitsOutput` class when handling `.fits` files and is triggered when the output specification includes a `.tile_width`, resulting in an infinite recursion when `FitsOutput::write_scanline` is called with a `y` value greater than the height.
*   The `close()` method in `FitsOutput` calls `write_scanlines` which in turn calls `FitsOutput::write_scanline` causing the recursive loop.
*  The issue is triggered by a specific condition `y > m_spec.height` within `FitsOutput::write_scanline` function which then calls close again.
* The provided crash information shows the stack trace leading to the crash caused by the stack overflow.
* The same root cause, a recursive call through `close()`, is present in CVE-2022-43594 concerning BmpOutput.
