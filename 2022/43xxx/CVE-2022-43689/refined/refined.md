Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-43689:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of SVG files. Specifically, the software was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks through entity expansion when sanitizing SVGs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability is that the software doesn't disable entity expansion when processing SVG files. This allows an attacker to inject external entities into the SVG, which can then be processed by the XML parser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DNS-based IP Disclosure:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause the server to make DNS requests to an attacker-controlled domain. This can reveal the internal IP address of the server or other sensitive information, although the provided documents state it is "IP disclosure" without more detail.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Uploaded SVG File:** An attacker would need to upload a specially crafted SVG file to the system that contains an external entity definition. The application processes this file which triggers a DNS request to the attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrative Privileges:**  The attacker needs administrative access to upload the malicious SVG file, as mentioned in the provided text: "Concrete is vulnerable to XXE based DNS requests which can lead to IP disclosure. The Concrete CMS Security team scored this 2.2 [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)."

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability is addressed by disabling entity expansion when sanitizing SVG files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity.
- The fix was included in Concrete CMS versions 8.5.10 and 9.1.3.
- The vulnerability was reported by Bogdan and Adrian Tiron from FORTBRIDGE.
