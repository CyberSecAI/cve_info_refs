        "Heap-based buffer overflow",

      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability can crash the application when processing a specially crafted video file.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted video file processed by the vulnerable application (dec265 or similar usage of the libde265 library)",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted video file to the vulnerable application. No special privileges required."

        "Fixed in libde265 versions 1.0.11-0+deb11u1 (Debian Bullseye)",

    "suggested_action": "Upgrade to the fixed versions of the libde265 library or apply relevant patches if available.",
        "additional_notes": [
          "The vulnerability is triggered in the `put_epel_16_fallback` function within `fallback-motion.cc` when processing a specially crafted video file, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.",
          "The issue arises due to a missing bounds check within the motion compensation function. This allows a specially crafted video file to cause out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in a denial of service.",
          "The vulnerability was reported by Fudan University.",
          "The root cause is a heap buffer overflow during motion compensation, specifically when accessing memory using calculated indices that may go out of bounds of allocated buffers."
