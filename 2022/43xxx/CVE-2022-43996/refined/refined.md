- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "upload" endpoint of the csaf_provider application allows uploading of CSAF advisories with a `text/html` content type and filenames ending in `.html`. These files are then served as HTML pages. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious HTML file containing Javascript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not properly sanitize or validate the uploaded files, and executes any Javascript found within the uploaded file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the uploaded CSAF advisories. When a user accesses the advisory via a web browser, the malicious script will execute in the user's browser context. This could lead to various impacts, including data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed on behalf of the user. The CVSS score indicates a medium severity with a high integrity impact and low availability impact.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker uploads a specially crafted HTML file containing malicious JavaScript to the vulnerable "upload" endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs high privileges to upload files, and the user has to interact with the malicious file by accessing it via the browser.
