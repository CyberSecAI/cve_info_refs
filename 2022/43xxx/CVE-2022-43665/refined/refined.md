- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `esc::engine::FileTool::GetTextSectionRange` function within the ESTsoft Alyac antivirus software. Specifically, the function incorrectly validates the `e_lfanew` field in the DOS header of a PE file when locating the NT header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read. The code checks if `e_lfanew` is larger than the file size, but does not check if it is equal to the file size, which can lead to the program attempting to read the NT header from beyond the file's boundaries, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS). The out-of-bounds read causes the malware scanning process to crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted PE file, where the `e_lfanew` field in the DOS header is equal to the file size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file to the vulnerable software for scanning. This could be achieved through various means, such as tricking a user into scanning the malicious file or by placing the file in a location where the antivirus program automatically scans files.
