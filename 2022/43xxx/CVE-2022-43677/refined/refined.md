  "response": {
    "root_cause": "A malformed NGAP message can cause an index-out-of-range panic in the `aper.GetBitString` function due to a length mismatch in the ASN.1 decoding process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation in the ASN.1 decoder (specifically in `aper.GetBitString`).",
      "Lack of proper separation between the control plane and the user plane, allowing user traffic to reach the AMF.",
      "The NGAP parser was not robust in handling malformed messages."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit leads to a crash of the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) and/or NGAP decoders, resulting in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition that disrupts the connectivity of the entire 5G network. This can lead to significant operational disruptions and potential financial losses.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a malformed NGAP message through the N1 interface (user device to AMF via gNB).",
      "Exploiting a lack of separation between the control and user planes, allowing user traffic (masquerading as user traffic) to trigger the vulnerability.",
         "Crafting a malformed message to trigger the out-of-bounds read."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to generate or modify NGAP messages.",
      "Knowledge of the AMF IP address (can be obtained through SCTP scanning via the User Plane in certain configurations).",
       "Ability to establish an SCTP connection with the AMF from the application layer of the UE."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the length field in the malformed NGAP message does not match the actual length of the following data. This causes the `aper.GetBitString` function to attempt an out-of-bounds read, leading to a panic. The issue was identified by fuzzing the NGAP decoder. The vulnerability was found in the free5GC project, an open-source implementation of a 5G core network. A fix was released in May 2023 that addresses the parsing issue in NGAP, however, the same crash could still be triggered from the user equipment via normal user traffic. Also, some tools (e.g. asn1-playground) accept to decode a null byte as the null value for such unconstrained integer.  The issue was tracked as CVE-2022-43677, GHSA-59hj-62f5-fgmc, and GO-2022-1083."
