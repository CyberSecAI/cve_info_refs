- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of the length of user-supplied data when parsing CGM files, specifically before copying it to a stack-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow. The application fails to properly check the size of the input data before copying it to a stack buffer, which can lead to overwriting adjacent memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a malicious CGM file or a malicious page embedding one. User interaction is required, where the user needs to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious CGM file, or host a webpage that will trigger the vulnerability. The attacker does not need any special privileges or position.
