Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the Online Leave Management System v1.0. It stems from the application's failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries. Specifically, it directly uses the value of the `id` parameter in the `manage_user` page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Leakage:** Attackers can extract information from the database, including database names, table structures and potentially sensitive data.
- **Potential for Data Modification:** A successful SQL injection could lead to unauthorized modification or deletion of data in the database.
- **System Takeover:** In some cases, SQL injection could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The specific vulnerable parameter is `id` in the `/leave_system/admin/?page=user/manage_user` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
- **Understanding of SQL syntax:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to construct injection payloads.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific vulnerable URL and parameter.

**Technical Details:**
- The content provides a sample SQL injection payload: `/leave_system/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=12' and length(database()) = 9--+`
- The payload uses the `length(database())` function to determine the length of the database name, which is a method to extract database information.
- The content demonstrates how the response changes based on whether the length check matches.
- The vulnerable file is identified as `/leave_system/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=`
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The database name length is determined to be 8, followed by the correct length being 9.
