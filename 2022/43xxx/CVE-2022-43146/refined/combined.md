The purpose of this article is to describe CVE-2022–43146 in detail. This CVE is related to remote code execution vulnerability via Arbitrary File Upload which was recently discovered on an open-source Canteen Management System. The motive of this application is to manage orders/invoices and generate reports.

## Details:

Effected Application can be downloaded [here](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15688/canteen-management-system-project-source-code-php.html). We used XAMPP to host the application locally.

Once the application is up and running we can visit the login page.

![Login Page]()

Let us login using a highly privileged account.

![After Login]()

After going through the source code we discovered “add-user.php” which allows a user to add another user.

![Adding a user]()

Capturing HTTP requests for add-user

![]()

On adding a user, the application sends a request to the path “/youthappam/php\_action/createUser.php”.

lets analysis the createUser.php source code.

![]()

From the above code, it is clear that **any user (unauthenticated)can create a user** as the application does not implement logic to check if a user is authenticated or not. let’s validate by creating a user without a valid session token.

![]()

Let’s check the database if the user was added successfully.

![]()

user was successfully added to the database, Trying to log in using a newly created user.

![]()![]()

The above-created user is low privileges use. which has limited features on its dashboard. The application does not implement an access control logic, hence this user can be used to perform actions to which a high-privilege user has access. One such feature is the website management feature. We can visit “manage\_website.php”

![]()

Now We have access to upload image functionality. let’s analyze the source code.

![]()

The application does not perform any kind of validation on the file being uploaded and stores the file on “/assets/uploadImage/Logo/\*”. enabling users to upload an arbitrary file. Users may upload the below-crafted PHP and perform remote code execution.

```
<?PHPecho shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>
```

Uploading the above PHP file.

![]()

Performing RCE

![]()
## Conclusion:

Canteen Management System v1 is vulnerable to RCE via file upload functionality. An attacker can create a user and can have access to upload file functionality. he may place a PHP back door to run commands remotely.

This source code is about billing software for the canteen management system project. It is a project that needs billing software. The objective of this project is to provide a billing solution that will help in the management of the canteen and its employees, as well as their customers. The system will be used to track transactions and generate reports on orders, food types, food items, etc. so that the management knows how much they have earned and what they need to spend.

You can be considered this project as an ordering system for a school cafeteria. The goal is to design a system that will allow students to order food bills by themselves.

I developed this project by identifying the needs of the students and teachers. We determined that they need an ordering system that is fast, accurate, and easy to use. Next, I looked at different technologies available on the market. I found out that there are many technologies available to us but none of them are perfect for our needs so we needed to create our own solution. Finally, I came up with an idea for our project: using PHP technology so that students can get bills for food orders without waiting in line.

I provide high-quality software projects, thesis writing services, website development services, and web application development. If there is any need you can contact me by email.
