### Take Patch Management Miles Ahead with the Industry Leading Patching Capabilities

 Automate Patching for Faster Deployment

Manual patching cycles are tedious and time-consuming. With the SanerNow automated patch management tool, configure end-to-end workflows for automatic patching and fix risks faster than ever. Schedule automated patching tasks and make patching a hands-free task. It also supports the upload of pre and post-remediation scripts.

 Test and Approve Patches for Zero-Disruption

Applying new patches directly to the production environment is risky. SanerNow patch management software enables you to create a test environment to test the new patches to verify compatibility. Later, deploy the approved patches across the devices in your production environment and prevent any disruptions and productivity errors.

 Perimeter-Less Patching with a Single, light-weight Agent

SanerNow auto patching software is an ideal solution for hybrid workforces. You can easily deploy patches across globally distributed devices from a centralized cloud patch management solution. Furthermore, all the patching tasks, from scanning to deployment, are executed by a single lightweight multifunctional agent installed in the endpoints. You can also go for the agent-less option, which is a unique approach to scanning while retaining the scan speed and accuracy.

 Risk based Prioritization to Deploy Patches Smartly

SanerNow auto patching tool thoroughly assesses the patches and prioritizes them based on their business context, technical impact, severity level, and more intelligence to help focus on critical patches immediately. Additionally, you can deploy these patches quickly to reduce risk exposure and plan your remediation efforts wisely.

 Firmware Patches for Complete Risk Mitigation

As important as the software application patches, firmware patches are critical to tightening IT security. Moreover, it is recommended to include firmware patching as you establish your automated patch management cadence to reduce security risk exposure. SanerNow patch manager supports patching for firmware updates to fix issues and errors in firmware.

 Continuous and Customizable Patch Scans to Identify Missing Patches

Move away from the periodic scans and make it a continuous process with SanerNow patch management software. Keep your patching up-to-date with customized, real-time, and continuous scans for verified patches based on your IT environment. You can additionally perform real-time, on-demand, scheduled, and automated patch scans with the SanerNow patch management tool.

 Cross-Platform Patching with Support for Third-Party Apps

SanerNow patch management tool supports multi-platform patching for all major operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, and 550+ third-party applications. SanerNow’s automated patching solution additionally maintains a pre-built patch repository for third-party application patches.

 Effortless Patch Rollback for an Error-Prone Patching

Patch rollback is made easier with the SanerNow automated patch management tool to avoid disruptions in business operations. It rollbacks the last stable version with zero downtime and a single click to easily deal with incompatible and error-prone software patches.

 Comply with Industry Benchmarks and Security Standards

Various industry regulatory standards and organizations mandate patch compliance. SanerNow auto patch management software provides a unified view of your software patch compliance to address deviations from compliance standards and deploy patches accordingly. However, with auto patching in SanerNow, you can quickly fix the misconfigurations and achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

 Insights and Tracking with Reports and Audit Logs

Track detailed insights on your patching metrics with auto-generated reports and an inbuilt audit log. SanerNow automated patch management software provides a wide range of reports to assess the patching status in your network. Additionally, SanerNow provides an insightful Patch Impact Report to analyze the impact of patches and track the patching activities.

![](https://www.secpod.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Asset-12@4x-8-1024x954-3.webp)

*“SanerNow’s patch management capabilities stand out from the competition since it can patch all the discovered vulnerabilities and perform other system-hardening actions. Even if no direct remediation is available, SanerNow applies security controls that provide workarounds for the* *vulnerabilities.”*

**– Swetha Krishnamoorthi, Senior Industry Analyst, Cybersecurity, Frost & Sullivan**

### Sandbox bypass vulnerabilities in Script Security Plugin and in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**SECURITY-2824 (1)
/
CVE-2022-43401 through CVE-2022-43404**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugins:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)
,

[`workflow-cps`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps)**

**Description:**

Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute.
Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.

Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities exist in Script Security Plugin and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin:

* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b\_0b\_0a\_a\_451 and earlier and in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2802.v5ea\_628154b\_c2 and earlier, various casts performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime were not intercepted by the sandbox.
  This includes casts performed when returning values from methods, when assigning local variables, fields, properties, and when defining default arguments for closure, constructor, and method parameters (CVE-2022-43401 in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).
* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b\_0b\_0a\_a\_451 and earlier, when casting an array-like value to an array type, per-element casts to the component type of the array are not intercepted by the sandbox (CVE-2022-43403).
* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b\_0b\_0a\_a\_451 and earlier, crafted constructor bodies and calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors can be used to construct any subclassable type (due to an incomplete fix for SECURITY-1754 in the [2020-03-09 security advisory](/security/advisory/2020-03-09/#SECURITY-1754)) (CVE-2022-43404).

These vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These vulnerabilities have been fixed:

* Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b\_d851b\_3 and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2803.v1a\_f77ffcc773 intercept Groovy casts performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime (CVE-2022-43401 in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).
* Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b\_d851b\_3 intercepts per-element casts when casting array-like values to array types (CVE-2022-43403).
* Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b\_d851b\_3 rejects improper calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors (CVE-2022-43404).

|  | Both plugins, Script Security Plugin and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin must be updated simultaneously. While Script Security Plugin could be updated independently, doing so would cause errors in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin due to an incompatible API change. |

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin

**SECURITY-2824 (2)
/
CVE-2022-43405 (Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin), CVE-2022-43406 (Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugins:
[`pipeline-groovy-lib`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-groovy-lib)
,

[`workflow-cps-global-lib`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps-global-lib)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and older releases of the Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin (formerly Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin) define the `library` Pipeline step, which allows Pipeline authors to dynamically load Pipeline libraries.
The return value of this step can be used to instantiate classes defined in the loaded library.

In Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin 612.v84da\_9c54906d and earlier and in Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 583.vf3b\_454e43966 and earlier, the `library` step can be used to invoke sandbox-generated synthetic constructors in crafted untrusted libraries and construct any subclassable type.
This is similar to SECURITY-582 in the [2017-08-07 security advisory](/security/advisory/2017-08-07/#multiple-groovy-language-features-allowed-script-security-plugin-sandbox-bypass), but in a different plugin.

This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define untrusted Pipeline libraries and to define and run sandboxed Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin 613.v9c41a\_160233f rejects improper calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors when using the `library` step.

Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 588.v576c103a\_ff86 no longer contains the `library` step.
It has been moved into the Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin.

### CSRF protection for any URL can be bypassed in Pipeline: Input Step Plugin

**SECURITY-2880
/
CVE-2022-43407**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-input-step`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-input-step)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a\_a\_4f405289 and earlier does not restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the `input` step.
This ID is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given `input` step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build URLs from `input` step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins when the `input` step is interacted with.

Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 456.vd8a\_957db\_5b\_e9 limits the characters that can be used for the ID of `input` steps in Pipelines to alphanumeric characters and URL-safe punctuation.
Pipelines with `input` steps having IDs with prohibited characters will fail with an error.

|  | This includes Pipelines that have already been started but not finished before Jenkins is restarted to apply this update. |
| --- | --- |

|  | [Pipeline: Declarative Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-model-definition/) provides an `input` directive that is internally using the `input` step, and specifies a non-default ID if not user-defined. Pipeline: Declarative Plugin 2.2114.v2654ca\_721309 and earlier may specify values incompatible with this new restriction on legal values: `input` directives in a `stage` use the stage name (which may include prohibited characters) and `input` directives in a `matrix` will use a value generated from the matrix axis values (which always includes prohibited characters). Administrators are advised to update Pipeline: Input Step Plugin and Pipeline: Declarative Plugin at the same time, ideally while no Pipelines are running. |
| --- | --- |

### CSRF protection for any URL can be bypassed in Pipeline: Stage View Plugin

**SECURITY-2828
/
CVE-2022-43408**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-stage-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-stage-view)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Stage View Plugin provides a visualization of Pipeline builds.
It also allows users to interact with `input` steps from Pipeline: Input Step Plugin.

Pipeline: Stage View Plugin 2.26 and earlier does not correctly encode the ID of `input` steps when using it to generate URLs to proceed or abort Pipeline builds.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to specify `input` step IDs resulting in URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins.

Pipeline: Stage View Plugin 2.27 correctly encodes the ID of `input` steps when using it to generate URLs to proceed or abort Pipeline builds.

|  | This vulnerability is only exploitable with Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a\_a\_4f405289 or older due to the fix for [SECURITY-2880](#SECURITY-2880). |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin

**SECURITY-2881
/
CVE-2022-43409**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-support`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-support)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin provides a feature to add hyperlinks, that send POST requests when clicked, to build logs.
These links are used by Pipeline: Input Step Plugin to allow users to proceed or abort the build, or by Pipeline: Job Plugin to allow users to forcibly terminate the build after aborting it.

Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 838.va\_3a\_087b\_4055b and earlier does not sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create Pipelines.

Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 839.v35e2736cfd5c properly encodes URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.

### Webhook endpoint discloses job names to unauthorized users in Mercurial Plugin

**SECURITY-2831
/
CVE-2022-43410**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mercurial`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mercurial)**

**Description:**

Mercurial Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/mercurial/notifyCommit` that can be used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository.
This endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository.
It can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication.

In Mercurial Plugin 1251.va\_b\_121f184902 and earlier, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to access.
This allows attackers with knowledge of Mercurial repository URLs to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this Mercurial repository.

Mercurial Plugin 1260.vdfb\_723cdcc81 does not provide the names of jobs for which polling is triggered unless the user has the appropriate Item/Read permission.

### Non-constant time webhook token comparison in GitLab Plugin

**SECURITY-2877
/
CVE-2022-43411**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin)**

**Description:**

GitLab Plugin 1.5.35 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether the provided and expected webhook token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid webhook token.

GitLab Plugin 1.5.36 uses a constant-time comparison when validating the webhook token.

### Non-constant time webhook token comparison in Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin

**SECURITY-2874
/
CVE-2022-43412**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid webhook token.

Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin 1.84.2 uses a constant-time comparison when validating the webhook token.

### Missing permission check in Job Import Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs

**SECURITY-2791
/
CVE-2022-43413**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`job-import-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-import-plugin)**

**Description:**

Job Import Plugin 3.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in Job Import Plugin 3.6 requires Job Import/Import Jobs permission.

### Agent-to-controller security bypass vulnerability in NUnit Plugin

**SECURITY-2551
/
CVE-2022-43414**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`nunit`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/nunit)**

**Description:**

NUnit Plugin 0.27 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message that parses files inside a user-specified directory as test results.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain test results from files in an attacker-specified directory on the Jenkins controller.

NUnit Plugin 0.28 changes the message type from agent-to-controller to controller-to-agent, preventing execution on the controller.

### XXE vulnerability in REPO Plugin

**SECURITY-2337
/
CVE-2022-43415**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`repo`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/repo)**

**Description:**

REPO Plugin 1.15.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control which `repo` binary is executed on agents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

REPO Plugin 1.16.0 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

### Agent-to-controller security bypass vulnerability in Katalon Plugin

**SECURITY-2844
/
CVE-2022-43416**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`custom-checkbox-parameter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/custom-checkbox-parameter)**

**Description:**

Custom Checkbox Parameter Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation.
Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix.
Additionally, several plugins have previously been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default, see [SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list](/security/advisory/2022-04-12/#SECURITY-2617).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### XXE vulnerability in BMC AMI DevX Total Test Plugin

**SECURITY-2625
/
CVE-2022-43430**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compuware-topaz-for-total-test`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compuware-topaz-for-total-test)**

**Description:**

BMC AMI DevX Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for the 'Topaz for Total Test - Execute Total Test scenarios' build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Missing permission check in BMC AMI Strobe Measurement Task Plugin allows enumerating credentials IDs

**SECURITY-2631
/
CVE-2022-43431**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`compuware-strobe-measurement`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/compuware-strobe-measurement)**

**Description:**

BMC AMI Strobe Measurement Task Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by XFramium Builder Plugin

**SECURITY-2863
/
CVE-2022-43432**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`xframium`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/xframium)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

XFramium Builder Plugin 1.0.22 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins as soon as it is loaded.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

|  | Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url) configured are unaffected. |

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by ScreenRecorder Plugin

**SECURITY-2864
/
CVE-2022-43433**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`screenrecorder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/screenrecorder)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

ScreenRecorder Plugin 0.7 and earlier programmatically updates [the Java system property](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-model-directorybrowsersupport-csp) allowing administrators to customize the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins to include `media-src: 'self'`.
On a Jenkins instance with default configuration, this effectively disables all other directives in the default rule set, including `script-src`.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

|  | Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url) configured are unaffected. |

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin

**SECURITY-2865
/
CVE-2022-43434**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`neuvector-vulnerability-scanner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/neuvector-vulnerability-scanner)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.20 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step is executed.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

### Content-Security-Policy protection for user content can be disabled in 360 FireLine Plugin

**SECURITY-2866
/
CVE-2022-43435**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`fireline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/fireline)**

**Description:**

Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

360 FireLine Plugin 1.7.2 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins whenever the 'Execute FireLine' build step is executed, if the option 'Open access to HTML with JS or CSS' is checked.
This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

|  | Jenkins instances with [Resource Root URL](/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url) configured are unaffected. |

SECURITY-2824 (1) / CVE-2022-43401 through CVE-2022-43404
Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low
privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally
safe to execute. Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are
intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the
call is to be allowed.

Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities exist in Script Security Plugin and
Pipeline: Groovy Plugin:

* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier and in
  Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2802.v5ea_628154b_c2 and earlier, various casts
  performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime were not intercepted
  by the sandbox.
  This includes casts performed when returning values from methods, when
  assigning local variables, fields, properties, and when defining default
  arguments for closure, constructor, and method parameters (CVE-2022-43401
  in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).
* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, when
  casting an array-like value to an array type, per-element casts to the
  component type of the array are not intercepted by the sandbox
  (CVE-2022-43403).
* In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, crafted
  constructor bodies and calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors
  can be used to construct any subclassable type (due to an incomplete fix
  for SECURITY-1754 in the 2020-03-09 security advisory) (CVE-2022-43404).

These vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run
sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection
and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

SECURITY-2824 (2) / CVE-2022-43405 (Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin)
  & CVE-2022-43406 (Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin)
Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and older releases of the Pipeline:
Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin (formerly Pipeline: Shared Groovy
Libraries Plugin) define the `library` Pipeline step, which allows Pipeline
authors to dynamically load Pipeline libraries. The return value of this
step can be used to instantiate classes defined in the loaded library.

In Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin 612.v84da_9c54906d and earlier and in
Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 583.vf3b_454e43966 and
earlier, the `library` step can be used to invoke sandbox-generated
synthetic constructors in crafted untrusted libraries and construct any
subclassable type. This is similar to SECURITY-582 in the 2017-08-07
security advisory, but in a different plugin.

This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define untrusted
Pipeline libraries and to define and run sandboxed Pipelines, to bypass the
sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins
controller JVM.

SECURITY-2880 / CVE-2022-43407
Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not
restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the `input` step. This
ID is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given
`input` step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build
URLs from `input` step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any
target URL in Jenkins when the `input` step is interacted with.

SECURITY-2828 / CVE-2022-43408
Pipeline: Stage View Plugin provides a visualization of Pipeline builds. It
also allows users to interact with `input` steps from Pipeline: Input Step
Plugin.

Pipeline: Stage View Plugin 2.26 and earlier does not correctly encode the
ID of `input` steps when using it to generate URLs to proceed or abort
Pipeline builds.

This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to specify `input` step
IDs resulting in URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target
URL in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2881 / CVE-2022-43409
Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin provides a feature to add hyperlinks, that
send POST requests when clicked, to build logs. These links are used by
Pipeline: Input Step Plugin to allow users to proceed or abort the build,
or by Pipeline: Job Plugin to allow users to forcibly terminate the build
after aborting it.

Pipeline: Supporting APIs Plugin 838.va_3a_087b_4055b and earlier does not
sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to create Pipelines.

SECURITY-2831 / CVE-2022-43410
Mercurial Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at `/mercurial/notifyCommit`
that can be used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository. This
endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for
all jobs configured with the specified repository. It can be accessed with
GET requests and without authentication.

In Mercurial Plugin 1251.va_b_121f184902 and earlier, the output of the
webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered
or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to
access. This allows attackers with knowledge of Mercurial repository URLs
to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this
Mercurial repository.

SECURITY-2877 / CVE-2022-43411
GitLab Plugin 1.5.35 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison
when checking whether the provided and expected webhook token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid webhook token.

SECURITY-2874 / CVE-2022-43412
Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin 1.84.1 and earlier does not use a
constant-time comparison when checking whether the provided and expected
webhook token are equal.

This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain
a valid webhook token.

SECURITY-2791 / CVE-2022-43413
Job Import Plugin 3.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an
HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

SECURITY-2551 / CVE-2022-43414
NUnit Plugin 0.27 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message
that parses files inside a user-specified directory as test results.

This allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain test
results from files in an attacker-specified directory on the Jenkins
controller.

SECURITY-2337 / CVE-2022-43415
REPO Plugin 1.15.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent
XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control which `repo` binary is executed on
agents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external
entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or
server-side request forgery.

SECURITY-2844 / CVE-2022-43416
Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier implements an agent/controller message
that does not limit where it can be executed and allows invoking Katalon
with configurable arguments.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to invoke Katalon on
the Jenkins controller with attacker-controlled version, install location,
and arguments. Attackers additionally able to create files on the Jenkins
controller (e.g., attackers with Item/Configure permission could archive
artifacts) can invoke arbitrary OS commands.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2845 (1) / CVE-2022-43417
Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier does not perform permission checks in
several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an
attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2845 (2) / CVE-2022-43418
Katalon Plugin 1.0.33 and earlier does not require POST requests for
several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerabilities.

This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL
using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

SECURITY-2846 / CVE-2022-43419
Katalon Plugin 1.0.32 and earlier stores API keys unencrypted in job
`config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

These API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or
access to the Jenkins controller file system.

SECURITY-2836 / CVE-2022-43420
Contrast Continuous Application Security Plugin 3.9 and earlier does not
escape data returned from the Contrast service when generating a report.

This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control or modify Contrast service API
responses.

SECURITY-2852 / CVE-2022-43421
Tuleap Git Branch Source Plugin provides a webhook endpoint at
`/tuleap-hook/` that can be used to trigger Tuleap projects configured with
a specified repository.

In Tuleap Git Branch Source Plugin 3.2.4 and earlier, this endpoint can be
accessed without authentication.

This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger Tuleap projects whose
configured repository matches the attacker-specified value.

SECURITY-2620 / CVE-2022-43422
Compuware Topaz Utilities Plugin 1.0.8 and earlier implements an
agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of
Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2622 / CVE-2022-43423
Compuware Source Code Download for Endevor, PDS, and ISPW Plugin 2.0.12 and
earlier implements an agent/controller message that does not limit where it
can be executed.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of
Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2627 / CVE-2022-43424
Compuware Xpediter Code Coverage Plugin 1.0.7 and earlier implements an
agent/controller message that does not limit where it can be executed.

It allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of
Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process.

NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier,
LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

SECURITY-2797 / CVE-2022-43425
Custom Checkbox Parameter Plugin 1.4 and earlier does not escape the name
and description of the parameter types it provides.

This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilites
exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that parameters are listed on
another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages
provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to
prevent exploitation. Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of
vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and
"Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the SECURITY-353 /
CVE-2017-2601 fix. Additionally, several plugins have previously been
updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default,
see SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2480 / CVE-2022-43426
S3 Explorer Plugin stores AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in its global configuration
file `s3explorer.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its
configuration.

While this secret is stored encrypted on disk, in S3 Explorer Plugin 1.0.8
and earlier the global configuration form does not mask the
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY form field, increasing the potential for attackers to
observe and capture it.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2623 / CVE-2022-43427
Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier does not perform
permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2624 / CVE-2022-43428 (Java system properties) & CVE-2022-43429 (read files)
Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier implements two
agent/controller messages that do not limit where they can be executed.

* `RemoteSystemProperties` allows attackers able to control agent processes
to obtain the values of Java system properties from the Jenkins
controller process (CVE-2022-43428).
* `GetRemoteUTF8FileContents` allows attackers able to control agent
processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system
(CVE-2022-43429).

NOTE: These vulnerabilities are only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and
earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2625 / CVE-2022-43430
Compuware Topaz for Total Test Plugin 2.4.8 and earlier does not configure
its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

This allows attackers able to control the input files for the 'Topaz for
Total Test - Execute Total Test scenarios' build step to have Jenkins parse
a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2631 / CVE-2022-43431
Compuware Strobe Measurement Plugin 1.0.1 and earlier does not perform a
permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials
IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an
attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2863 / CVE-2022-43432
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

XFramium Builder Plugin 1.0.22 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins as soon
as it is loaded. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users
with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2864 / CVE-2022-43433
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

ScreenRecorder Plugin 0.7 and earlier programmatically updates the
Java system property allowing administrators to customize the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins to
include `media-src: 'self'`. On a Jenkins instance with default
configuration, this effectively disables all other directives in the
default rule set, including `script-src`. This allows cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces,
archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2865 / CVE-2022-43434
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin 1.20 and earlier globally disables
the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins
whenever the 'NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner' build step is executed. This
allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to
control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-2866 / CVE-2022-43435
Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by
Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces,
`/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is
specified.

360 FireLine Plugin 1.7.2 and earlier globally disables the
`Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins
whenever the 'Execute FireLine' build step is executed, if the option 'Open
access to HTML with JS or CSS' is checked. This allows cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces,
archived artifacts, etc.

NOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
