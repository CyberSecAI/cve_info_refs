Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an arbitrary file upload issue in the `manage_website.php` file of the Canteen Management System v1.0. The system does not properly validate uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The application does not validate the type or content of the uploaded file, allowing the upload of a PHP file.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** There is no sanitization of the file name or content, which allows the execution of the malicious code after upload.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a full system compromise (RCE). This could include stealing sensitive data, modifying files, or gaining full control of the server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `manage_website.php` file, including the malicious PHP file disguised as a website image file within a `multipart/form-data` request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the vulnerable Canteen Management System application.
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a super admin, using the credentials `mayuri.infospace@gmail.com/rootadmin`.
    *   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the vulnerable `manage_website.php` script and the upload directory.

**Summary:**
The provided document describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Canteen Management System v1.0 due to an unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the `manage_website.php` file. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the server.
