Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3573-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : frr
Version        : 7.5.1-1.1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-36440 CVE-2022-40302 CVE-2022-40318 CVE-2022-43681
                 CVE-2023-31490 CVE-2023-38802 CVE-2023-41358 CVE-2023-41360
                 CVE-2023-41361 CVE-2023-41909
Debian Bug     : 1035829 1036062

Multiple security vulnerabilities were found in frr, the FRRouting suite
of internet protocols. Maliciously constructed Border Gateway Protocol
(BGP) packages or corrupted tunnel attributes may cause a denial of service
(application crash) which could be exploited by a remote attacker.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
7.5.1-1.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your frr packages.

For the detailed security status of frr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/frr>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Debian Bug     : 1035829 1036062

Brief introduction

Multiple vulnerbilities were discovered in frr, the FRRouting suite of
internet protocols, while processing malformed requests and packets the BGP
daemon may have reachable assertions, NULL pointer dereference, out-of-bounds
memory access, which may lead to denial of service attack.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.5.1-1.1+deb11u2.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.4.4-1.1~deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your frr packages.

For the detailed security status of frr please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/frr>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>
