| **Author: bob11.devranger@gmail.com**  **Date: 2022-10-07**  **OS: Windows, Linux, MacOS**  **Beekeeper Studio Version: 3.6.6**  **DB Type&Version: MySQL 5.7 and 8.0 Also**   ---  Summary It has been possible to trigger remote code execution via Beekeeper’s **Modal Container**. Description Beekeeper has the modal container which indicates the user’s interaction is valid and due to a lack of sanitization of the modal contents, It has an XSS vulnerability like this:  *[1]* [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42366390/194698702-2522239e-69a5-43d7-bbd7-3de10c09ccae.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42366390/194698712-c3ad3b64-61de-49d6-9d2d-7367b503287e.png)  *[2]* [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42366390/194698740-09a8538d-f692-4a62-a259-223f551eff49.png) [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42366390/194698746-ea894e29-f85f-4d3a-88f1-b9ad767dc90e.png)  The modal’s content also is transferred by MySQL packet when only the user’s interaction is invalid like this: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42366390/194698755-111a9ea9-192a-4715-b112-32580be8652e.png)  So, Taking advantage of the report in [CVE-2022-26174](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26174), it has been possible Remote Code Execution via Modal Container.  In this case, I made the fake MySQL server which spoofs user’s modal output when the user puts some data in a table.  This is my sample fake SQL server : [poc.py](https://github.com/goseungduk/beekeeper/blob/master/poc.py)  You can see this poc video that fake SQL server triggers RCE via Beekeeper.  [PoC\_Video](https://youtu.be/sR411Mczo7w)  In this video, I used this XSS script `<input type="text" onfocus="require('child_process').execSync('calc.exe')" autofocus />` for modal error output and any input that user passes is replaced by that XSS script and re-passed to the user.  Finally, Malicious Code is triggered in the user’s PC and is continued until the modal is inactivated.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42366390/194698899-d40f7808-ab25-4eba-9f5c-d34ce48365e1.png) What’s More?  * Not only data inserting functions but also any functions which use error modal(e.g. create table), It seems that we can trigger RCE too.  Temporary Fake SQL Server `146.56.129.188:3306`   * You can do these poc in this fake SQL server with Beekeeper * If you have any problems, contact me via **a42873410@gmail.com** or **bob11.devranger@gmail.com** * Thank You :) |
