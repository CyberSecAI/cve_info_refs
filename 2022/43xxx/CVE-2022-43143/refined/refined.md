The content is related to CVE-2022-43143.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of sanitization of modal contents within the Beekeeper Studio application. This allowed for the injection of malicious code through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XSS vulnerability in the modal container.
- Inadequate sanitization of user-provided data displayed in modal outputs.
- The modal content is transferred via MySQL packets when user interaction is invalid.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine.
- Execution of arbitrary code through XSS injection in the modal container.
- Ability to perform malicious actions on the userâ€™s PC until the modal is inactivated.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor sets up a fake MySQL server.
- The attacker crafts a malicious XSS payload and injects it as part of the error message returned from a fake MySQL server.
-  When the user interacts with the application and receives the error message (which is displayed in a modal), the XSS code is executed.
- Any function that uses the error modal is vulnerable (e.g., data inserting, create table).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control a MySQL server that the Beekeeper client connects to.
- The attacker must be able to manipulate the server's responses to inject the malicious XSS code.
- The user needs to interact with the application in a way that triggers the display of an error message in a modal.
