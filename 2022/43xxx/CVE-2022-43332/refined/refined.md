Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is insufficient input sanitization in the "Site title" field within the WonderCMS configuration panel. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- Missing `HttpOnly` flag on the session cookie: This allows the injected JavaScript to access and steal the session cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
  - Cookie theft: Attackers can steal session cookies of logged-in users, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.
  - Defacement: Attackers can modify the visual appearance of the website.
  - Redirection: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Further attacks: The injected code can be used to launch other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious payload into the "Site title" field within the WonderCMS configuration panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the WonderCMS configuration panel. This usually means the attacker needs to have administrator-level access or have compromised an admin account.
- The attacker can exploit the vulnerability using a crafted payload.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided content explicitly mentions the vulnerable version: WonderCMS v3.3.4.
- It includes a sample payload: `<script>javascript:alert(document.cookie)</script>` that can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The content also points out that the absence of `HttpOnly` flag on the cookie is essential for successful cookie stealing.
