Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of PDF files by CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. This lack of validation leads to a read operation past the end of an allocated object.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists due to the insufficient validation of user-provided data when parsing PDF files.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose sensitive information. It could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
*   **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a malicious PDF file. The user must either open this malicious file or visit a malicious page that triggers the vulnerable parsing process.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious PDF file. The user must then interact with the malicious PDF file to trigger the vulnerability.
