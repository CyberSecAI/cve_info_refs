Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-43774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a SQL Injection flaw in the `HandlerPageP_KID` C# class of Delta Electronics DIAEnergie V1.9.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied inputs (`HtmlId`, `KID` URL parameters) before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the remote system.
- **Data Manipulation:** The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how an attacker can change the root user password in the database, giving them full access to the system
- **Full Compromise:** Ultimately, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely without requiring prior authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the target system.
- **No Credentials Needed:** No user credentials are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists within the handling of the `/DataHandler/HandlerPageP_KID.ashx` endpoint, when `ttype` parameter is set to `GetUDcontent`.
- The vulnerable code constructs SQL queries using string formatting, directly embedding attacker-controlled values from the `HtmlId` and `KID` parameters without sanitization.
-  Specifically, this line in `HandlerPageP_KID.ProcessRequest()` is vulnerable: `string text26 = "select * from DIAE_UD where HID='{0}' and kid='{1}'"; dataTable = ADODB_Common.OpenDataTable(connectionString, string.Format(text26, text7, text2), false);`
- The content provides a curl PoC to change the root password.

**Additional Notes:**

- The content also mentions `CVE-2022-43775` which is also related to a SQL Injection vulnerability in `HICT_Loop` class of the same software.
- The vendor has released a fix version 1.9.02.002 of the product.
- Tenable attempted to contact the vendor multiple times before public disclosure.
