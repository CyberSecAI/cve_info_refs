# Privilege escalation in project role template binding (PRTB) and -promoted roles

High

[macedogm](/macedogm)
published
GHSA-7m72-mh5r-6j3r
Jan 25, 2023

## Package

gomod

rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 2.5.0, < 2.5.17
>= 2.6.0, < 2.6.10

## Patched versions

2.5.17
2.6.10

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9, where an authorization logic flaw allows privilege escalation via project role template binding (PRTB) and `-promoted` roles. This issue is not present in Rancher 2.7 releases.

Note: Consult Rancher [documentation](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/authentication-permissions-and-global-configuration/manage-role-based-access-control-rbac/cluster-and-project-roles) for more information about cluster and project roles and [KB 000020097](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020097) for information about `-promoted` roles.

This privilege escalation is possible for users with access to the `escalate` verb on PRTBs (`projectroletemplatebindings.management.cattle.io`), including users with `*` verbs on PRTBs (see notes below for more information). These users can escalate permissions for any `-promoted` resource (see the table below for a full enumeration) in any cluster where they have a PRTB granting such permissions in at least one project in the cluster.

On a default Rancher setup, only the following roles have such permissions:

1. Project Owner
2. Manage Project Members

These roles have permissions to affect the following resources:

| Resource | API Group | Affected Rancher version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| navlinks | ui.cattle.io | 2.6 |
| nodes | "" | 2.6 |
| persistentvolumes | "" | 2.5, 2.6 |
| persistentvolumes | core | 2.5, 2.6 |
| storageclasses | storage.k8s.io | 2.5, 2.6 |
| apiservices | apiregistration.k8s.io | 2.5, 2.6 |
| clusterrepos | catalog.cattle.io | 2.5, 2.6 |
| clusters (`local` only) | management.cattle.io | 2.5, 2.6 |

Notes:

1. During the calculation of the CVSS score, `privileges required` was considered as `high` because, by default, `standard user` and `user-base` users in Rancher do not have `create`, `patch` and `update` permissions on `roletemplates`.
2. If a role template with access to those objects was already created by another user in the cluster, then this issue can be exploited by users without the mentioned permissions from point 1.

### Workarounds

If updating Rancher to a patched version is not possible, then the following workarounds must be observed to mitigate this issue:

1. Only grant Project Owner and Manage Project Members roles to trusted users.
2. Minimize the creation of custom roles that contain the `escalate`, `*` or write verbs (`create`, `delete`, `patch`, `update`) on `projectroletemplatebindings` resource, and only grant such custom roles to trusted users.
3. Minimize the number of users that have permissions to `create`, `patch` and `update` `roletemplates`.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.17 and 2.6.10 and later versions. This issue is not present in Rancher 2.7 releases.

### Detection

The following script was developed to list role template bindings that give written access to the affected resources listed above. It is highly recommended to run the script in your environment and review the list of identified roles and role template bindings for possible signs of exploitation of this issue. The script requires `jq` installed and a `kubeconfig` with access to Rancher local cluster; it can also be executed in Rancher's kubectl shell.

```
#!/bin/bash

help="
Usage: bash find_promoted_resource.sh \n \n

Requires: \n
- jq installed and on path \n
- A kubeconfig pointing at rancher's local cluster (can also run from rancher's kubectl shell) \n \n

Outputs a list of roletemplates and roletemplate bindings which give write access to promoted resources.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
