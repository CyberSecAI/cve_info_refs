# Attachment upload XSS

Low

[dvz](/dvz)
published
GHSA-p9m7-9qv4-x93w
Nov 19, 2022

## Package

MyBB

## Affected versions

< 1.8.32

## Patched versions

1.8.32

## Description

### Impact

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the post *Attachments* interface allow attackers to inject HTML by persuading the user to upload a file with specially crafted name.

The impact may be reduced when:

* the attachment feature is disabled (*Admin CP → Configuration → Settings → Attachments: [Enable Attachment Functionality](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1831/install/resources/settings.xml#L1518-L1525)* setting is set to *No*), or
* the *Can post attachments?* permission is disabled for individual usergroups in individual forums.

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

### Details

Following the upload of a file as an attachment to a post, the name of the file may be added dynamically to the DOM in an unsafe manner.

* **CVE-2022-43708.1** — Reflected XSS (Type 1)

  The file name, included in the server response constructed at:

  <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1831/inc/functions_upload.php#L826>

  is not escaped correctly, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.
* **CVE-2022-43708.2** — DOM-Based XSS (Type 0)

  The file name, included in HTML code containing a list of conflicting filenames, constructed client-side at:

  <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1831/jscripts/post.js#L218>

  is not escaped correctly, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability.

### Patches

MyBB 1.8.32 resolves this issue with the following changes:

* Commit: [c3c474a](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/c3c474a5b70f9fb4bb368b5b58c623b1c9e2fc16)
  + `.patch`: <https://github.com/mybb/mybb/commit/c3c474a5b70f9fb4bb368b5b58c623b1c9e2fc16.patch>

### Workarounds

To reduce impact without upgrading MyBB, change the following setting (*Admin CP → Configuration → Settings*):

* *Attachments → [Enable Attachment Functionality](https://github.com/mybb/mybb/blob/mybb_1831/install/resources/settings.xml#L1518-L1525)*: *No*

### References

* Release Notes: <https://mybb.com/versions/1.8.32/>
