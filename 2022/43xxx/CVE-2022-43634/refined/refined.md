  "CVE-2022-43634": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the dsi_writeinit function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-17646.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it into a fixed-length heap-based buffer in the `dsi_writeinit` function.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on vulnerable Netatalk installations.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Netatalk service. No authentication is required.",
     "Additional details": "The vulnerability is located in the `dsi_writeinit` function where a fixed-length heap buffer is used to copy user-supplied data without proper length validation, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow."
