**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper validation of user inputs**, which allows for SQL injection. The specific location where validation was missing is not mentioned, but the fix involved adding proper validation and escaping special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. This means that an attacker can insert malicious SQL code into input fields that are then executed by the application's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Query Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute custom SQL queries against the database.
*   **Data Access:** Attackers can access and potentially extract database table entries, including sensitive information stored within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
