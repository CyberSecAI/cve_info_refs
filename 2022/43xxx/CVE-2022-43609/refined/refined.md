- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the parsing of STP files within IronCAD. Specifically, when parsing the VECTOR element, a pointer is not properly initialized before being accessed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uninitialized pointer usage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user opening a specially crafted malicious STP file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to create a malicious STP file. The user needs to interact with the file or visit a malicious page for exploitation.
