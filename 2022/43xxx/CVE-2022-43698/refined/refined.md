Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-43698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation when updating external POP3 mail account settings. Specifically, the system did not consider deny-list values when processing user-provided input during POP3 account updates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability (CWE-918)
- Failure to adhere to deny-list restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can direct server-initiated requests to internal resources that are usually restricted.
- This can potentially be used to identify "internal" addresses and services based on the timing and content of error responses.
- Violation of perimeter-based security policies.
- Although data exfiltration is not mentioned as a direct result, the information gained about internal services can be valuable for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Exploitation occurs through the modification of settings for a valid external POP3 mail account.
- The user-controlled input (specifically, the values used to update POP3 account settings) is the attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account within the application, with the ability to change a valid external POP3 mail account's settings.
- The attacker needs to have the privilege to add or modify a POP3 mail account.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the backend component of the OX App Suite.
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring compliance with existing deny-list content when updating POP3 mail accounts.
- Affected versions of OX App Suite backend: 7.10.5-rev50 and 7.10.6-rev29
- Fixed versions of OX App Suite backend: 7.10.5-rev51 and 7.10.6-rev30
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 5.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).
