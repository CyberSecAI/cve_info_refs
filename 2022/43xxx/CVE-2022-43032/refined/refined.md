{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory leaks in the mp42aac binary when processing specific input files, as identified by AddressSanitizer (ASAN).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leaks, specifically in `AP4_DescriptorFactory::CreateDescriptorFromStream`, `AP4_List<AP4_Descriptor>::Add`, `AP4_ObjectDescriptor::AP4_ObjectDescriptor` and `AP4_DataBuffer::ReallocateBuffer`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory leaks, which can potentially lead to resource exhaustion, especially if the vulnerable code is repeatedly executed with malicious inputs.",
  "Attack vectors": "Providing a crafted input file to the `mp42aac` binary.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file to the `mp42aac` binary."
