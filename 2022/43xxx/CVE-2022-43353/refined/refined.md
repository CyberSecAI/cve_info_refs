Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `/php-sms/admin/?page=orders/view_order` endpoint before using it in a SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The `id` parameter in the URL is directly incorporated into a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided payload demonstrates how to leak the database name.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful SQL injection can lead to more severe consequences, such as:
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   User impersonation and privilege escalation.
    *   Remote code execution in some scenarios, although this is not specifically demonstrated by the provided example.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, with the malicious SQL code embedded in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft a payload that will successfully exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Target URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL of the vulnerable page (`/php-sms/admin/?page=orders/view_order`) and the vulnerable parameter (`id`).

**Additional Details:**

* The provided content shows a specific example using `updatexml` to extract the database name (`sms_db`). This confirms a blind SQL injection is present.
* The attacker used the payload `1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` which bypasses some filtering and uses the `updatexml` function with `concat` function to reveal data in an error message, which is a common blind SQL injection technique.

This information provides a more detailed understanding of the SQL injection vulnerability than a basic CVE description would.
