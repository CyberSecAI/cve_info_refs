The provided content describes a memory leak vulnerability in Open5gs SMF (Session Management Function) when processing PFCP (Packet Forwarding Control Protocol) packets.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `src/smf/pfcp-path.c` file of Open5gs. Specifically, the `ogs_pfcp_node_add` function allocates memory for `pfcp_node` structures, but these nodes are not freed after use or upon encountering an error. Instead, they are only released when the SMF terminates, leading to a memory exhaustion if more than the allocated pool size (64) of PFCP connections are made.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is a memory leak due to the improper handling of allocated memory for PFCP nodes. The `ogs_pfcp_node_pool` has a fixed size of 64, and the code does not reclaim the allocated `pfcp_node` structures when they are no longer needed. This leads to memory exhaustion when more than 64 PFCP connections are made.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploiting this vulnerability results in a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. When the `ogs_pfcp_node_pool` is exhausted, the SMF crashes.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is sending multiple PFCP packets (more than 64) through different sockets, which triggers the allocation of `pfcp_node` structures until the pool is exhausted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the capability to send PFCP packets to the SMF. No specific position is required beyond having network access to the SMF. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending more than 64 pfcp connection requests through different sockets.
