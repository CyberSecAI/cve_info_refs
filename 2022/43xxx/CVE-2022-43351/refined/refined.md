The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Sanitization Management System v1.0" by oretnom23, which allows for arbitrary file deletion.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `/php-sms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img` endpoint. The application does not properly sanitize or validate the `path` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server for deletion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The application lacks proper input validation for the `path` parameter in the `delete_img` function. This allows an attacker to specify any file path on the server.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** While the provided exploit uses a session, it is not stated if access to the admin panel or a valid session is a hard requirement. This would normally restrict access to the vulnerable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can delete any file on the server that the web server process has permissions to access. This could lead to:
*   **Denial of Service:** Deleting critical system files or application files can render the application unusable.
*   **Data Loss:**  Deletion of database files or uploaded content can lead to data loss.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Removing log files could obscure evidence of malicious activity, while removing key configuration files might enable privilege escalation by allowing the attacker to manipulate the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to `/php-sms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_img`.
*   **`path` Parameter:** The `path` parameter in the POST request specifies the file to be deleted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of File Paths:** The attacker needs to know or guess file paths on the server to delete specific targets.
*   **Potentially Valid Session:** The provided exploit sends a session cookie with the POST request. However it is unclear from the provided information if a valid session is required or not to delete files.
