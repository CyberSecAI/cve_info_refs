The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Diagnostic Lab Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `delete_reservation` function within the `Master.php` file, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as the database name, using SQL injection techniques like `updatexml` with `concat` and `select database()`.
- Potential for data manipulation or deletion: While the provided example focuses on information disclosure, the vulnerability could also potentially allow for modification or deletion of data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/odlms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_reservation` endpoint with the `id` parameter containing malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated as the vulnerability is in a publicly accessible part of the system.
