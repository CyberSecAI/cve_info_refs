VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

[Un-/Collapse All](#/)

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory.
Wherever applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-4304

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over that connection.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-4450

The function PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name\_out", "header" and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack. The functions PEM\_read\_bio() and PEM\_read() are simple wrappers around PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM\_X509\_INFO\_read\_bio\_ex() and SSL\_CTX\_use\_serverinfo\_file() which are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if PEM\_read\_bio\_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the PEM\_read\_bio\_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0215

The public API function BIO\_new\_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO\_f\_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO\_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64\_write\_ASN1() which may cause BIO\_new\_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO\_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM\_write\_bio\_ASN1\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_CMS\_stream, PEM\_write\_bio\_PKCS7\_stream, SMIME\_write\_ASN1, SMIME\_write\_CMS and SMIME\_write\_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d\_ASN1\_bio\_stream, BIO\_new\_CMS, BIO\_new\_PKCS7, i2d\_CMS\_bio\_stream and i2d\_PKCS7\_bio\_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0286

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1\_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL\_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1\_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL\_NAME\_cmp as an ASN1\_TYPE rather than an ASN1\_STRING. When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509\_V\_FLAG\_CRL\_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs over a network.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0464

A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack on affected systems.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the `X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0465

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates may be
vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent certain checks.

Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are silently ignored by
OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are skipped for that certificate.
A malicious CA could use this to deliberately assert invalid certificate policies
in order to circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether.

Policy processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing
the `-policy` argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()` function.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-0466

The function X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification.

As suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was
decided to keep the existing behavior of the X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_add0\_policy()
function.

Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform certificate
policy check need to use X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set1\_policies() or explicitly
enable the policy check by calling X509\_VERIFY\_PARAM\_set\_flags() with
the X509\_V\_FLAG\_POLICY\_CHECK flag argument.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not
commonly used by applications.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-3446

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_check(), DH\_check\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH\_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH\_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls DH\_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack. The function DH\_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_ex() and EVP\_PKEY\_param\_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check' option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-4807

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86\_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. Impact summary: If in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non-volatile XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller all the XMM registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86\_64 processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However given the contents of the registers are just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue. As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable OPENSSL\_ia32cap: OPENSSL\_ia32cap=:~0x200000 The FIPS provider is not affected by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-5678

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH\_generate\_key() to generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise, applications that use DH\_check\_pub\_key(), DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex() or EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH\_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH\_check\_pub\_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH\_generate\_key() performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q. An application that calls DH\_generate\_key() or DH\_check\_pub\_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. DH\_generate\_key() and DH\_check\_pub\_key() are also called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH\_check\_pub\_key\_ex(), EVP\_PKEY\_public\_check(), and EVP\_PKEY\_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the "-pubcheck" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2023-29469

An issue was discovered in libxml2 before 2.10.4. When hashing empty dict strings in a crafted XML document, xmlDictComputeFastKey in dict.c can produce non-deterministic values, leading to various logic and memory errors, such as a double free. This behavior occurs because there is an attempt to use the first byte of an empty string, and any value is possible (not solely the '\0' value).

SSA-476715: Two Vulnerabilities in Automation License Manager

| Publication Date: | 2023-01-10 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2023-03-14 |
| Current Version: | V1.1 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 8.2 |

SUMMARY

Siemens Automation License Manager contains two vulnerabilities which, when combined, could allow an attacker to modify and rename license files, extract licenses and overwrite arbitrary files on the target system potentially leading to privilege escalation and remote code execution. The affected functionality is not available for remote attackers in the default configuration since version V6.0 SP2 of Automation License Manager.

Siemens has released an update for Automation License Manager V6 and recommends to update to the latest version. Siemens recommends specific countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| Automation License Manager V5  All versions | Currently no fix is planned   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |
| Automation License Manager V6  All versions < V6.0 SP9 Upd4 | Update to V6.0 SP9 Upd4 or later version  <https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/114358/>   See further recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#mitigations-section) |

WORKAROUNDS
AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* If no remote connections are needed, disable “Allow Remote Connections” on the Automation License Manager settings menu (default since version V6.0 SP2)
* If remote connections are needed, limit remote access to port 4410/tcp to trusted systems only

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Automation License Manager (ALM) centrally manages license keys for various Siemens software products. Software products requiring license keys automatically report this requirement to the ALM. When the ALM finds a valid license key for this software, the software can be used in conformity with the end user license agreement.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (<https://www.first.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
<https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43513

The affected components allow to rename license files with user chosen input without authentication.
This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to rename and move files as SYSTEM user.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 8.2 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS Vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L/E:P/RL:O/RC:C |
| CWE | CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path |

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43514

The affected component does not correctly validate the root path on folder related operations, allowing to modify files and folders outside the intended root directory.
This could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute file operations of files outside of the specified root folder. Chained with CVE-2022-43513 this could allow Remote Code Execution.

| CVSS v3.1 Base Score | 7.7 |
