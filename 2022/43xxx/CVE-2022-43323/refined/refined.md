- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The EyouCMS v1.5.9 application lacks proper CSRF protection in the backend member center's top-up balance feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing actions (like topping up a user's balance) without their consent or knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized financial manipulation within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTML page that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, silently submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint (the member balance top-up functionality) on the EyouCMS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator of the EyouCMS system into opening a specially crafted malicious HTML file.
