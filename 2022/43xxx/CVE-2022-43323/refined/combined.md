| EyouCMS v1.5.9 has a vulnerability, Cross-site request forgery(CSRF).Located in the backend, member center, editing, Top up balance. To exploit this vulnerability, a quasi-prepared HTML file needs to be opened 1、Go to the background --> member center--> edit member--> Top up balance [图片1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966247-5c00e54d-e16e-4112-8691-6e1cf16fc4d5.jpg) [图片2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966104-8b302f9a-2b01-431a-ae1d-98eb9b0b4133.jpg) [图片3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966253-2f0ea300-5eb9-4451-aefc-c003642ce856.jpg) 2、Grab the request package for recharge and construct it [图片4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966423-3cce85dc-37e3-47b5-8a4e-eb12f8bc7098.jpg) 3、Open in another browser and go to the background page, see that the user test01 balance is 1000 [图片5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966571-3ccce498-9389-4c51-84fb-95dd833cd27a.jpg) 4、Click on the structured page [图片6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966578-201a5f3b-29ab-4b92-9029-d4519ffbac8b.jpg) [图片7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966587-65919627-965a-4e1c-806f-7ac3cd198107.jpg) The figure above shows the page that automatically jumps after successful execution to check whether the balance has increased？ The balance has increased by 1000: [图片8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/195966616-1e843a2d-e639-4e72-8e45-2441caca06e5.jpg) |
