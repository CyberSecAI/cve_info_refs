The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Canteen Management System v1.0 by mayuri_k.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `fetchSelectedUser.php` file. Specifically, the `userid` parameter is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data, modify database content, or perform other malicious activities by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. In the example, the attacker is able to leak the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP POST request to the `/youthappam/php_action/fetchSelectedUser.php` with the crafted `userid` parameter in the request body
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
