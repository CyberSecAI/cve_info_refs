Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43709:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the Admin Control Panel (ACP) user management module of MyBB. Specifically, the `build_users_view()` function doesn't correctly escape column names related to custom profile fields when constructing SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application fails to sanitize or properly escape user-controlled input when constructing SQL queries in `build_users_view()`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to:
    - Read sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially execute arbitrary database commands.
- This could lead to complete compromise of the MyBB forum, data breaches, and other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have valid Admin CP access with the 'Can manage users?' permission.
- **Direct User Input/Stored Search Filter Settings:** The attacker can inject SQL code via direct user input when creating user views, showing referred users, and searching for users. The input can also be stored in search filter settings, allowing persistent exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with administrative access to the MyBB Admin CP with the necessary permissions ("Can manage users?").
- The attacker also needs the technical know-how to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the file `admin/modules/user/users.php` at line 3459.
- The vulnerable code uses the variable `$userfield_sql` in a SQL query.
- The fix for this issue is in MyBB version 1.8.32.
- The patch can be found in commit `68b7abe`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity
