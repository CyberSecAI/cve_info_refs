# Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the radio template in Splunk Enterprise

**Advisory ID:** SVD-2022-1108

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2022-43568](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-43568)

**Published:** 2022-11-02

**Last Update:** 2022-11-02

**CVSSv3.1 Score:** 8.8, High, High

**CVSSv3.1 Vector:** [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**CWE:** [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)

**Bug ID:** SPL-228379

## Description

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.12, 8.2.9, and 9.0.2, a View allows for a Reflected Cross Site Scripting via JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in a query parameter when output\_mode=radio.

## Solution

For Splunk Enterprise, upgrade versions to 8.1.12, 8.2.9, 9.0.2, or higher.

For Splunk Cloud Platform, Splunk is actively patching and monitoring the Splunk Cloud instances.

## Product Status

| Product | Version | Component | Affected Version | Fix Version |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Splunk Enterprise | 8.1 | Splunk Web | 8.1.11 and lower | 8.1.12 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 8.2 | Splunk Web | 8.2.0 to 8.2.8 | 8.2.9 |
| Splunk Enterprise | 9.0 | Splunk Web | 9.0.0 to 9.0.1 | 9.0.2 |
| Splunk Cloud Platform |  | Splunk Web | 9.0.2203.4 and lower | 9.0.2205 |

## Mitigations and Workarounds

The vulnerability affects instances with [Splunk Web](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) enabled, disabling Splunk Web is a possible workaround. See [Disable unnecessary Splunk Enterprise components](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/DisableunnecessarySplunkcomponents) and the [web.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Webconf) configuration specification file for more information on disabling Splunk Web.

## Detections

* [Splunk Reflected XSS in the templates lists radio](https://research.splunk.com/application/d532d105-c63f-4049-a8c4-e249127ca425/)

Splunk versions 8.1.0, 8.2.0, and 9.0.0 are vulnerable to reflected cross site scripting (XSS) exploitation leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI) in the Splunk Assist application. This detection search provides information on exploitation attempts.

## Severity

Splunk rates the vulnerability as High, 8.8, with a CVSS Vectors of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. The vulnerability requires user interaction within a browser. If the Splunk Enterprise instance does not run Splunk Web, there is no impact and the severity is Informational.

# Detection: Splunk Reflected XSS in the templates lists radio

### Description

The following analytic identifies potential reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attempts in Splunk versions below 8.1.12, 8.2.9, and 9.0.2. It detects when a query parameter with `output_mode=radio` is used in a URI, leveraging `splunkd_webx` logs with status 200 and non-null URI queries. This activity is significant as it can indicate an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise of the affected Splunk instance.

### Search

```
1`splunkd_webx` user=admin status=200 uri=*/lists/entities/x/ui/views* uri_query!=null
2| stats count earliest(_time) as event_time values(status) as status values(clientip) as clientip by index, sourcetype, _time, host, user, uri
3| `splunk_reflected_xss_in_the_templates_lists_radio_filter`

```
### Data Source

| Name | Platform | Sourcetype | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Splunk](/sources/d8a2c791-460b-4756-a8e5-ecade77b21e3) | Splunk icon [Splunk](/platform/splunk) | `'splunkd_ui_access'` | `'splunkd_ui_access.log'` |

### Macros Used

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| [splunkd\_webx](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/develop/macros/splunkd_webx.yml) | `index=_internal sourcetype=splunk_web_access` |
| splunk\_reflected\_xss\_in\_the\_templates\_lists\_radio\_filter | `search *` |

`splunk_reflected_xss_in_the_templates_lists_radio_filter` is an empty macro by default. It allows the user to filter out any results (false positives) without editing the SPL.

### Default Configuration

This detection is configured by default in Splunk Enterprise Security to run with the following settings:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Disabled | true |
| Cron Schedule | `0 * * * *` |
| Earliest Time | `-70m@m` |
| Latest Time | `-10m@m` |
| Schedule Window | `auto` |
| Creates Risk Event | False |

This configuration file applies to all detections of type hunting.
### Implementation

This vulnerability only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled. This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to search the \_internal index.

### Known False Positives

This search may produce false positives as it is difficult to pinpoint all possible XSS injection characters in a single search string. Special attention is required to "en-US/list/entities/x/ui/views" which is the vulnerable injection point.

### Associated Analytic Story

* [Splunk Vulnerabilities](/stories/splunk_vulnerabilities/)

### Risk Based Analytics (RBA)

| Risk Message | Risk Score | Impact | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Potential XSS exploitation against radio template by $user$ | 25 | 50 | 50 |

The Risk Score is calculated by the following formula: Risk Score = (Impact \* Confidence/100). Initial Confidence and Impact is set by the analytic author.
