The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Password Storage Application v1.0" software.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page. Specifically, the `cmddept` parameter in `add-fee.php` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Improper input sanitization/validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to account hijacking, session theft, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.
- Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted payload injected into the `cmddept` parameter of the `add-fee.php` page, which is accessed via  `/psa_php/api.php?action=save`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit a crafted request with the malicious payload. 
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, as the API endpoint is vulnerable regardless.
