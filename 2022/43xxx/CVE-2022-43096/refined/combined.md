| | Security Improvement Notes  | DGW Application 48.5.2718 | | --- |  * [Summary](#h_65883019137371625594247539) * [Security changes](#section_features)  --- Summary | ID | Synopsis | | --- | --- | | DGW-14973 | SIP: Support additional DHE ciphers | | DGW-15007 | User passwords are now securely hashed | | DGW-15338 | OWASP: Disable access to internal UART | | DGW-15442 | CVE-2022-0778: Possible Denial of Service (DoS) from purposedly crafted TLS certificate |   ---  Security changes DGW-15442 - CVE-2022-0778: Possible Denial of Service (DoS) from purposedly crafted TLS certificate An important security flaw was found in the OpenSSL library affecting DGW version 48.4 and below. If exploited successfully, this vulnerability could cause the unit to reboot unexpectedly.  The CVE-2022-0778 has been addressed by upgrading the OpenSSL library to version 1.1.1n.    DGW-15338 - OWASP: Disable access to internal UART Follow OWASP IoT Verification Requirement C.1:Verify that application layer debugging interfaces such USB, UART, and other serial variants are disabled or protected by a complex password.    DGW-15007 - User passwords are now securely hashed User passwords are no longer saved in clear text, but instead saved in a cryptographically secure way, using the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hash algorithm.  Previously, when exporting a backup or configuration script, the passwords could be read in clear-text. Now, only the hashed passwords are visible.  A user cannot retrieve a forgotten password anymore, since it is impossible to reverse a hashed password into a clear-text password. In case all passwords are forgotten, a partial reset or factory reset can be done to restore to the factory initial passwords.    DGW-14973 - SIP: Support additional DHE ciphers The SipEp service now supports the following DHE ciphers when using SIP over TLS:   * TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256 * TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_GCM\_SHA256 * TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA256 * TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_GCM\_SHA384   ---  Copyright Notice Copyright 2022 Media5 Corporation.
