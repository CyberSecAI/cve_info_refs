- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Brocade SANnav product supports weak key exchange algorithms on specific ports.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of weak key exchange algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential compromise of confidentiality due to weak encryption. The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality (C:H) but no impact on integrity (I:N) or availability (A:N).
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting ports 24, 6514, 18023, 19094, and 19095.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable ports and requires a low privilege (PR:L). No user interaction (UI:N) is needed.
