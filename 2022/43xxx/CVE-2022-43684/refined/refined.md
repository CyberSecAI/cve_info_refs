Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43684:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure access control within the "ChartDataProcessor" processor in ServiceNow, combined with overly permissive read access to sensitive database tables and insufficient signature validation of the `glide_user_activity` token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Access Control:** The `ChartDataProcessor` processor, accessible via an XHR request to `xmlhttp.do`, lacks proper access controls, allowing low-privileged users to interact with it.
*   **Overly Permissive Read Access:**  Low-privileged users could access sensitive tables in the ServiceNow database (e.g., `sys_user_session`, `sys_user_token`) via the vulnerable processor, which should have been restricted.
*   **Insufficient Signature Validation:** The `glide_user_activity` token's signature was not properly validated, making it possible to forge a valid token by manipulating the original one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could use the vulnerability to take over any user account, including administrative accounts, by crafting valid session cookies and headers.
*   **Full Admin Compromise:** By taking over an administrator account, attackers gained the ability to perform any action on the ServiceNow instance, including granting themselves admin privileges and impersonating other users.
*  **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive tables such as  `sys_user`, `sys_emails`, and potentially other tables, could lead to exposure of user data, contact information, vulnerability reports, server information etc.
* **Lateral movement**: The compromised ServiceNow instance can be used as an entry point to other systems, since ServiceNow often has access to other subsystems like Midservers, provisioning tools, monitoring systems, desktop orchestration tools.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Attackers could spoof communications from the service desk, potentially tricking users into divulging further information or carrying out actions.
*   **Remote Software Installation:**  Attackers could potentially install software on customer desktops through compromised tools accessible via ServiceNow.
*   **Undetected Attacks:**  The attack could go undetected for a long time if the attacker is careful.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct XHR Requests:** Attackers can send crafted XHR POST requests to `xmlhttp.do` using the `ChartDataProcessor`.
*   **GQL Injection:** Exploiting the lack of access control in the `ChartDataProcessor`  processor to query sensitive tables using specially crafted GQL requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low-Privileged User Account:** The attacker needs a valid low-privileged user account on the target ServiceNow instance.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the ServiceNow instance.
*   **Knowledge of ServiceNow API:** Knowledge of ServiceNow's GQL and how to structure requests to retrieve data is needed.

**Additional details:**
The provided content reveals additional details such as:

*   The vulnerable versions of ServiceNow, and the patches that remediated the issue.
*   A detailed breakdown of how to exploit the vulnerability, including the specific GQL queries needed to extract session information and forge the `glide_user_activity` token.
*   A proof-of-concept script demonstrating the exploit.
*   Timeline of vulnerability disclosure showing ServiceNow's delayed response.
*   A CVSS score of 9.9 was calculated for the chained vulnerabilities.
*   ServiceNow also uses impersonation to allow admin to login into any user account for debugging purposes, we were able to use the admin account to impersonate a spefical user admin account and grant our account admin privileges on the ServiceNow instance.
