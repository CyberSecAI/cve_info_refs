Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-43398:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a session fixation vulnerability where the affected devices do not renew the session cookie after login/logout and also accept user-defined session cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary vulnerability is that the device fails to invalidate or renew session cookies upon user login or logout. It also accepts custom session cookies provided by an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can overwrite the session cookie of a legitimate user.
*   After the victim logs in, the attacker gains access to the user's account using the pre-set session cookie.
*   This allows the attacker to impersonate the victim and potentially perform actions with the victim's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the web interface of the device.
*   An attacker needs to craft a specific session cookie and somehow get the victim user to use it or obtain a valid cookie before the user logs in.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated before the attack
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject a crafted session cookie for a victim user. This could be done in a variety of ways such as via a malicious link or Man in the Middle attack.
*   User interaction is required for the attack to succeed

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability is present in both SICAM Q100 and SICAM Q200 devices.
*   The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 with the vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
*   The weakness is categorized as CWE-384: Session Fixation.
*   The advisory recommends updating to specific versions of the software to remediate the vulnerability.
*   A workaround is suggested, restricting access to port 443/tcp to trusted IP addresses only.
