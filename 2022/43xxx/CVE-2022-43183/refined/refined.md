Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `JobLogController.java` of Xxl-job version 2.3.1, specifically in the `/logDetailCat` endpoint.
*   The application directly sends a query log request to the address specified by the `executorAddress` parameter without proper validation. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary address, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
*   The request to the attacker-controlled address includes the `XXL-JOB-ACCESS-TOKEN`, which can be captured by the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The application makes an outbound request to a user-controlled URL without proper validation.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `XXL-JOB-ACCESS-TOKEN` is leaked in the request headers when the application makes a request to the attacker's server.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `executorAddress` parameter is not validated to ensure it is a valid and authorized executor address.
*   **Insecure Token Handling:** The access token is sent in the header without any encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can use the leaked `XXL-JOB-ACCESS-TOKEN` to call the executor's Restful API and execute arbitrary commands on the executor. This can lead to complete compromise of the executor system.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Even low-privileged users can exploit this vulnerability to gain control over executors.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **SSRF Trigger:** An attacker sends a request to the vulnerable `/logDetailCat` endpoint of the `xxl-job-admin`, specifying a malicious address as the `executorAddress`.
2.  **Token Leakage:** The server makes an HTTP request to the attacker's server, including the `XXL-JOB-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the headers.
3.  **Command Execution:** The attacker uses the leaked token to make API calls to the executor's Restful API, triggering the execution of arbitrary commands on the executor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the `xxl-job-admin` web interface:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user on the platform to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to intercept HTTP traffic:** The attacker needs to set up a server to receive the request made by the vulnerable application and capture the `XXL-JOB-ACCESS-TOKEN`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `XXL_JOB_LOGIN_IDENTITY` cookie is also included in the request.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `xxl-job` up to and including 2.3.1.
*   The issue was resolved by filtering the URL in the `com.xxl.job.core.util.XxlJobRemotingUtil#postBody` method, to send the access token only when the URL ends with callback, registry or registryRemove.
