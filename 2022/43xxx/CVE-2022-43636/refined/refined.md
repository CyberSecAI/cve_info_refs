- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The httpd service uses insufficiently random sequence numbers for session management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of sufficient randomness in session sequence numbers, leading to authentication bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication on the system, potentially gaining unauthorized access and control.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability through the httpd service listening on TCP port 80.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be network-adjacent to the vulnerable device. Authentication is not required.
