   "summary": "The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Linksys WRT54GL router. It highlights a command injection vulnerability in the `check_tssi` function within the httpd web server and a buffer overflow vulnerability present in the start_epi function also in the httpd web server.  These vulnerabilities stem from insufficient input validation and usage of unsafe C functions like `sprintf` respectively. Both vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges, allowing attackers to fully compromise the device. The command injection requires injecting into a CGI parameter whereas the buffer overflow requires a return to libc style attack"
