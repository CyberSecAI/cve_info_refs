The provided content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Online Tours & Travels Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `add_travellers.php` file, which allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without restricting the file type.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** There is no validation to prevent the upload of executable files like PHP scripts.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (e.g., a web shell) and execute it on the server. This grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request containing a malicious PHP file disguised as a user photo, along with other traveller information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel and the `travellers.php` form.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerable file path is `tour/admin/operations/travellers.php`.
* The uploaded files are stored in the `/tour/admin/img` directory.
* The provided request package demonstrates how a malicious PHP file can be uploaded.
* The content includes screenshots confirming code execution through the uploaded file.
