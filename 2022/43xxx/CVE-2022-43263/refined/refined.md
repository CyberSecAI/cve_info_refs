Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in Guitar Pro (1.10.2) for iPad and iPhone, as described in the blog post:

**1. Filename XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows users to import guitar tabs via a web server interface. The filename of the uploaded tab file is not properly sanitized when displayed in the application, leading to XSS.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of input sanitization for the file name when rendering the file upload interface in the application.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the filename. When the application displays the list of files, this code will be executed within the context of the application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted file with a malicious filename via the web server interface used for file importing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the web server interface provided by the application for importing files, and needs the victim to open the file upload screen.

**2. Directory Traversal**

*   **Root Cause:** The application exposes an endpoint that allows users to download files. The file path provided in the request is not properly sanitized and allows directory traversal.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation and sanitization of the file path requested by the user. The application does not prevent the use of ".." sequences in the URL.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can use directory traversal techniques (e.g., using `../` in the URL) to access sensitive files on the device that the application has access to, such as `/etc/passwd` or `/etc/hosts`
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, including directory traversal sequences in the file path.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to access the local web server provided by the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The blog post mentions a potentially dangerous "delete" endpoint, but the author didn't test it out of caution.
*   The blog post also notes that the vendor was notified of these issues.
*   The filename XSS is described as a client-side vulnerability, while the directory traversal is server-side.
