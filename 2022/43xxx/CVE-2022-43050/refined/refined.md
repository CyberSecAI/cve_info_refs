The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Online Tours & Travels Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `update_profile.php` file, which allows arbitrary file uploads without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system does not validate the type or content of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to upload executable code.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize the uploaded file's content, which leads to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can upload and execute malicious PHP code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.
- Data breach and manipulation: After gaining control of the system, the attacker could steal sensitive data or modify existing data.
- Service disruption: The attacker could cause the application to malfunction or become unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/tour/admin/operations/admin.php?id=2` with a malicious PHP file disguised as a profile image.
- Multipart form-data: The request uses multipart/form-data to send the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the admin panel: The attacker needs to be logged into the application with administrative privileges (Super Admin account `mayuri.infospace@gmail.com/admin`).
- Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
