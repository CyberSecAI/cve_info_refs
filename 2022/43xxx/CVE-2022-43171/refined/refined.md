The provided content is related to CVE-2022-43171.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A crafted Mach-O file can cause a heap-buffer-overflow in `LIEF::MachO::BinaryParser::parse_dyldinfo_generic_bind` function due to an out-of-bounds read operation when parsing the dyldinfo binding information. Specifically, the `nlist[i].str_idx` value is not validated against the size of the string table, leading to a read outside of allocated memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow
- Out-of-bounds read

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to memory access violation
- Potential for further exploitation if an attacker can control the overflowed data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted Mach-O file.
- The vulnerable code is triggered when parsing the `dyldinfo` bind information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious Mach-O file to the vulnerable code.
- No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability. The application using the library must parse a malicious Mach-O file.

**Additional details:**
The provided information also includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) file (`poc1.zip`) that triggers the vulnerability. Additionally, a stack trace and Address Sanitizer output were included. The vulnerability was addressed by commit `98d3392` and `8bd685c`
