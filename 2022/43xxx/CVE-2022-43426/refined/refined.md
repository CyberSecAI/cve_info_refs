Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-43426:

**CVE-2022-43426**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The S3 Explorer Plugin stores the AWS secret access key in its global configuration file (`s3explorer.xml`) on the Jenkins controller. Although this key is encrypted on disk, the global configuration form does not mask the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` form field, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of masking of the AWS secret access key in the plugin's global configuration form.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who can access the Jenkins global configuration form (even if they do not have the ability to save) might observe the unmasked secret key. This secret key can be used to access the configured AWS resources.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to access the Jenkins global configuration page, where the S3 Explorer Plugin is configured, and then observe the unmasked AWS secret key.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to access the Jenkins global configuration page. This can range from an administrator to someone who has gained unauthorized access or has a compromised account with sufficient permissions.

**Additional Notes**

*   The advisory explicitly states that while the secret is stored encrypted on disk, the lack of masking in the form is the vulnerability.
*   There is no fix available at the time of the advisory for this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **Low** severity.
