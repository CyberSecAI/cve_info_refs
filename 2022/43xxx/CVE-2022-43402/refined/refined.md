Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-43402:

**CVE-2022-43402**

*   **Root Cause:** Implicit casts performed by the Groovy language runtime were not intercepted by the sandbox in the Pipeline: Groovy Plugin.
*   **Weakness:** The sandbox in the Pipeline: Groovy Plugin failed to intercept implicit casts performed when returning values from methods, assigning local variables, fields, properties, and when defining default arguments for closure, constructor, and method parameters.
*  **Impact:** Attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, could bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.
*   **Attack Vector:** By defining and running a sandboxed script that utilizes implicit casts of specific return values, local variables, fields, properties or default arguments.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines.

**Affected Component:** Pipeline: Groovy Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 2802.v5ea\_628154b\_c2 and earlier

**Fixed Version:** 2803.v1a\_f77ffcc773
