The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the Guitar Pro application on iPad and iPhone, and it specifically mentions CVE-2022-43264, which is for the directory traversal vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The application's server functionality, which allows importing guitar tabs, has a directory traversal vulnerability in the file download functionality. The application does not properly validate user-supplied file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application allows accessing arbitrary files on the device via the download functionality. By manipulating the URL, an attacker can navigate to parent directories and retrieve sensitive files like `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/passwd`, etc.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read sensitive files from the device. This could lead to information disclosure, such as user credentials or other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack is performed over the network by sending crafted HTTP requests to the application's built-in server.
*   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the device running the application and must be on the same network or have access to the network hosting the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device running the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's server functionality.
*   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target device.
*  The application's server functionality must be enabled and accessible by the attacker.
