Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the 'staff settings' of the Move CRM. Specifically, the 'lProfileCopy' parameter within the POST request used to save profile changes was not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means the injected malicious script is saved in the CRM database and executed when other users view the affected content.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The system failed to properly filter or escape user-supplied input in the 'lProfileCopy' parameter. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Frontend Bypass:** The vulnerability was able to bypass frontend filtering mechanisms. This indicates a failure to perform proper validation and sanitization of user-provided content on the server-side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Code Injection:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.
*   **Potential Account Takeover:** While the content states that session hijacking is not trivial due to IP-locked sessions, other XSS impacts could potentially lead to account compromises such as session stealing if the IP check is circumvented.
*   **Data Manipulation and Exfiltration:** XSS can be used to steal user data, modify content, or redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **POST Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the 'lProfileCopy' parameter in the POST request sent when saving changes in the staff profile settings.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker intercepts the POST request using tools and modifies the parameter to include the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Login Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to access the 'staff settings' in the Move CRM. This implies the attacker would likely be an internal or authorized user to the CRM.
*   **Ability to Intercept HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP POST requests, typically with tools like web proxies.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered on August 2, 2022, and resolved on August 4, 2022.
*   The affected version was version 4, build 260, and the fixed version is version 4, build 261.
*   The session is IP locked which makes direct session stealing difficult.
*   The vulnerability was resolved within 36 hours of being notified.
