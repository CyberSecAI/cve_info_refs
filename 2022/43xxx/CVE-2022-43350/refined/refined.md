The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Sanitization Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `delete_inquiry` function within the `Master.php` file. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly inserted into a SQL query, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not sanitize user-provided data within the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database, including database name, table structures, and data.
- Data manipulation: Attackers might be able to modify or delete data within the database.
- Potential for complete system compromise: In severe cases, successful exploitation of SQL injection can lead to complete system compromise by allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/php-sms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_inquiry` endpoint.
- Malicious payload injection: Injecting SQL code within the `id` parameter (e.g., `id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server to send the malicious HTTP POST request.
- Basic understanding of SQL: The attacker needs to know how to craft SQL queries for injection.

The provided content includes a specific payload that can be used to leak the database name: `id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`. It also includes the HTTP request details to reproduce the vulnerability.
