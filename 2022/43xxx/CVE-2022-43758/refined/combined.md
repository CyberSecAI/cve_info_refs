# Command injection in Rancher Git package

High

[macedogm](/macedogm)
published
GHSA-34p5-jp77-fcrc
Jan 25, 2023

## Package

gomod

rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 2.5.0, < 2.5.17
>= 2.6.0, < 2.6.10
>= 2.7.0, < 2.7.1

## Patched versions

2.5.17
2.6.10
2.7.1

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in Rancher from versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16, 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0, where a command injection vulnerability is present in the Rancher Git package. This package uses the underlying Git binary available in the Rancher container image to execute Git operations.

Specially crafted commands, when not properly disambiguated, can cause confusion when executed through Git, resulting in command injection in the underlying Rancher host.

This issue can potentially be exploited in Rancher in two ways:

1. Adding an untrusted Helm catalog, in the Catalogs menu, that contains maliciously designed repo URL configuration in Helm charts.
2. Modifying the URL configuration used to download KDM (Kontainer Driver Metadata) releases.

By default, only the Rancher admin has permission to manage both configurations for the local cluster (the cluster where Rancher is provisioned).

Note: More information about this category of issue in version control system (VCS) tools are available in Snyk's [blog post](https://snyk.io/blog/argument-injection-when-using-git-and-mercurial/).

### Workarounds

Except for only adding trusted catalogs and the KDM URL to Rancher, there is no other workaround besides updating Rancher to a patched version.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.

It is also important to update to a patched version in case Rancher or its standalone Git package implementation is used as a Go library instead of the application itself. Otherwise, this vulnerability might affect your dependent code.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.
* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.
* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
