Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the URL when viewing log details.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code within the application.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript within the `id` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
    *   The attacker needs to lure a victim to click this malicious link. This can be achieved through social engineering or other means.
    *   The attacker doesn't need direct access to the server to perform this attack, as it is a client-side exploit triggered via user interaction with a crafted URL.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable URL:**  `http://127.0.0.1:8080/feehicms/frontend/web/admin/index.php?r=log%2Fview-layer`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id` (injected into the URL).
*   **Proof of Concept (POC):** `%3Csvg%20onload=alert(20221014)%3E` which translates to `<svg onload=alert(20221014)>`
