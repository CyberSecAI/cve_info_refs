Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-43499:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the SHIRASAGI CMS application. Specifically, it is caused by the ability to upload SVG files that can contain malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) [CWE-79]
- Unsanitized SVG file uploads leading to execution of arbitrary script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the web browsers of users, especially those with administrative privileges. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Data theft
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
1. An attacker uploads a malicious SVG file to the SHIRASAGI server through:
    - The admin interface via the "file" management section.
    - The CMS upload folders.
2. The attacker obtains the URL of the uploaded SVG file.
3. The attacker incorporates the URL into an HTML document, or otherwise causes a user to access the malicious SVG file via a browser.
4. When a user views this HTML or directly access the malicious SVG, the embedded script executes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires the ability to upload files to the SHIRASAGI server, either through administrative access or by exploiting upload functionality within the CMS.
- Needs to entice a user to access the malicious SVG.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all versions of SHIRASAGI prior to v1.16.2
- The vulnerability is related to how the application handles and displays uploaded SVG files, allowing embedded JavaScript code to be executed.
- Mitigation includes updating SHIRASAGI to v1.16.2 and configuring web server (Nginx or Apache) to force "Content-Disposition: attachment" header for SVG files.
