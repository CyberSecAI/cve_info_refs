The content is related to CVE-2022-43331.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `printOrder.php` file of the Canteen Management System. The `orderId` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `orderId` parameter.
- Lack of proper input sanitization before database query execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information from the database.
- In this specific instance, the attacker is able to determine the length of the database name.
- The attacker can potentially perform more advanced SQL injection attacks to read, modify, or delete data in the database or potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed via a POST request to `printOrder.php` by manipulating the `orderId` parameter.
- The attacker needs to send a specially crafted SQL query in the `orderId` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable `printOrder.php` endpoint.
- Knowledge of the application's structure is helpful for crafting payloads.
