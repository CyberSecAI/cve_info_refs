**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **File Manipulation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can execute file operations on files and folders located outside the specified root directory.
- **Remote Code Execution:** When chained with CVE-2022-43513, this could allow for Remote Code Execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated access:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network without needing any credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the affected system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is often combined with CVE-2022-43513 to achieve remote code execution, suggesting a two-step attack process.
- The affected functionality is not available for remote attackers in the default configuration since version V6.0 SP2 of Automation License Manager.
- Siemens has released an update (V6.0 SP9 Upd4 or later) to address this vulnerability in Automation License Manager V6.
