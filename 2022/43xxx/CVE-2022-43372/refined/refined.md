- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization of the `keyword` parameter in the `/admin/store.php` page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which would then be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various attacks like session hijacking, phishing, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `keyword` parameter and sends it to a victim. If the victim clicks on the crafted URL while logged into the system, the XSS will be triggered.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
    - The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to click on the malicious link.
    - The victim needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable `store.php` page.
