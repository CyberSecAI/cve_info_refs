Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

-   **Infinite recursion** within the `BmpOutput::close()` and `FitsOutput::close()` functions when processing a crafted image file. This recursion is triggered through a conditional check in `BmpOutput::write_scanline` and `FitsOutput::write_scanline` where `m_spec.y` is greater than `m_spec.height`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   The `close()` functions for BMP and FITS output formats do not properly handle cases where the image specification (specifically, the `y` and `height` parameters) are inconsistent, leading to a recursive loop
-   Lack of proper validation in `BmpOutput::write_scanline` and `FitsOutput::write_scanline`  before calling close again when writing to a malformed image.
-   The `close()` function can be indirectly called by the class destructor, compounding the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite recursion leads to a stack overflow, causing the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can craft a specially crafted BMP or FITS image file with specific parameters (e.g., a `tile_width` set and where `y` > `height`) to trigger the vulnerability.
-   The vulnerability is triggered when the crafted image is processed (e.g., during file conversion or processing).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malformed image to the vulnerable application. This could be achieved through various means such as:
    -   Uploading the malicious image through an application that uses OpenImageIO.
    -   Using command-line tools (like `iconvert` as shown in the report) with the malicious image as input
    -   Providing a crafted image within a larger file format that is processed by the software.

**Additional Details:**
- The Talos report indicates that  `ImageOutput::write_scanlines` is called with `m_spec.y`  and `m_spec.height`.  When the `write_scanline` is called if `m_spec.y` >  `m_spec.height` it then calls close which starts the recursion.
- The provided crash information includes a detailed stack trace, confirming the recursive calls and the stack overflow. The stack trace further shows the crash happening in `__asan_memcpy` function indicating the stack corruption has occurred.

This information is more detailed than the description in the CVE, which simply indicates a vulnerability exists without the specifics of the recursion, trigger conditions, or the impact of stack overflow.
