Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided content indicates two distinct crashes occurring when fuzzing `rtf2html`.

*   **Crash 1:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `skip_group` function in `rtf_tools.h`, specifically during a read operation. The overflow happens because a read of size 1 is attempted at an address just outside the allocated memory region. This suggests that the parsing logic in `skip_group` does not properly validate the bounds, potentially leading to reading outside the allocated buffer when processing malformed input.
*   **Crash 2:** A segmentation fault (SEGV) occurs within the `formatting_options::operator=` in `fmt_opts.h`. The crash happens due to a read from an unknown/high address, indicating the code is likely attempting to access memory it shouldn't or use an invalid pointer value. This suggests a potential issue in how formatting options are copied or handled, possibly involving an uninitialized or corrupted object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** A classic memory corruption vulnerability where the program attempts to access memory outside the bounds of an allocated heap buffer.
*   **Segmentation fault (SEGV):** A fault that occurs when the program attempts to access memory that it does not have the right to access. In this case, the root cause is dereferencing an invalid address, potentially indicating use-after-free or a similar memory management flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash 1 (Heap-buffer-overflow):** Could lead to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application. More importantly, it could lead to arbitrary code execution if the overflow can be controlled and leveraged to overwrite memory with malicious content.
*   **Crash 2 (SEGV):** Will cause a DoS via program termination. Although this specific crash doesn't reveal a clear path for exploitation beyond DoS, a deeper analysis of the root cause could reveal additional vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Fuzzing:** The identified crashes were discovered during fuzzing, implying that providing specially crafted, malformed RTF input to the `rtf2html` tool triggers the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide an RTF input to the `rtf2html` tool.
*   No special privileges or access are required besides providing the crafted input.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided code snippets from the stack trace point towards the `skip_group` function in `rtf_tools.h` for the heap-buffer-overflow and `formatting_options::operator=` in `fmt_opts.h` for the SEGV, further narrowing down the problematic areas.
* The provided POC archive (POC.zip) would likely contain the specific input files triggering these crashes.
* The information is provided by the Information Security Laboratory of Ocean University of China, indicating these are reproducible vulnerabilities.
