- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive information stored as Java strings can be obtained by an attacker due to how IBM Toolbox for Java processes these strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of Java strings within the IBM Toolbox for Java allows for information disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain sensitive information stored as Java strings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly detailed but involves leveraging the IBM Toolbox for Java, likely through its interface for accessing IBM i. The attacker would need to interact with the Db2 Mirror for i setup or GUI that uses the vulnerable IBM Toolbox for Java to exploit the flaw.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with the IBM Db2 Mirror for i setup or GUI which utilizes the affected IBM Toolbox for Java and would need to exploit the method used by the IBM Toolbox for Java to process strings.
