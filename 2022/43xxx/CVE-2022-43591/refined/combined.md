# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1650

## Qt Project Qt QML QtScript Javascript spreading buffer overflow vulnerability

##### January 12, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-43591

##### SUMMARY

A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the QML QtScript Reflect API of Qt Project Qt 6.3.2. A specially-crafted javascript code can trigger an out-of-bounds memory access, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Target application would need to access a malicious web page to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Qt Project Qt 6.4

##### PRODUCT URLS

Qt - <https://www.qt.io/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

8.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-122 - Heap-based Buffer Overflow

##### DETAILS

Qt is a popular software suite primarily used to create graphical user interfaces. It also contains a number of supporting libraries which all aim to enable cross-platform application development with a unified programming API.

Qt’s suite of libraries contains support for executing Javascript code through its QtScript engine, which is extensively used in QML. QtScript is historically based on WebKit’s JavaScriptCore, but the current codebase bears little resemblance to modern JavaScriptCore engine.

QtScript implementation supports a Javascript argument spreading syntax via use of `...` operator, where an array is spread into a list of arguments for a function call. QtScript’s implementation of argument spreading is vulnerable to a heap overflow. The vulnerability can be demonstrated with the following PoC Javascript code:

```
var a = []
a.length =  555840;
Math.max(...a)

```

In the above code, a simple array is constructed and its length set to a large value. This array is then used in a function call with a spreading `...` operator, which invokes spreading code in QtScript’s runtime:

```
static CallArgs createSpreadArguments(Scope &scope, Value *argv, int argc)
{
    ScopedValue it(scope);
    ScopedValue done(scope);

    int argCount = 0;

    Value *v = scope.alloc<Scope::Uninitialized>();                        [1]
    Value *arguments = v;                                                  [2]
    for (int i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
        if (!argv[i].isEmpty()) {
            *v = argv[i];
            ++argCount;
            v = scope.alloc<Scope::Uninitialized>();
            continue;
        }
        // spread element
        ++i;
        it = Runtime::GetIterator::call(scope.engine, argv[i], /* ForInIterator */ 1);              [3]
        if (scope.hasException())
            return { nullptr, 0 };
        while (1) {
            done = Runtime::IteratorNext::call(scope.engine, it, v);                              [4]
            if (scope.hasException())
                return { nullptr, 0 };
            Q_ASSERT(done->isBoolean());
            if (done->booleanValue())
                break;
            ++argCount;                                                                       [5]
            v = scope.alloc<Scope::Uninitialized>();                                          [6]
        }
    }
    return { arguments, argCount };
}

```

Above code implements the function that turns an array into a list of arguments to be passed into a function call. At [1] and [2] scoped allocation for arguments is made. At [3] an iterator through the input arguments is created and is then used at [4] inside an infinite while loop as long as there are elements. With each iteration, `argCount` is incremented at [5] and space for a new value is allocated at [6]. Allocation is performed via call to `scope.alloc` with no parameters, which ends up in the following code:

```
QML_NEARLY_ALWAYS_INLINE Value *alloc() const
{
    Value *ptr = engine->jsAlloca(1);
    switch (mode) {
    case Undefined:
        *ptr = Value::undefinedValue();
        break;
    case Empty:
        *ptr = Value::emptyValue();
        break;
    case Uninitialized:
        break;
    }
    return ptr;
}

```

Above code allocates space for one more value on the runtime stack by simply incrementing the pointer, without performing any additional checks for available space. Therefore, in a call to `createSpreadArguments`, elements can keep being allocated until the buffer overflows into adjacent memory or a guard page is hit. This can result in adjacent memory overwrite. Additionally, since the contents of the sparse array being spread is under control, a precise value being written out of bounds can easily be controlled (empty array entries result in zeros being written into `v` pointer, where non-zero depends on the type, primitive types being written verbatim).

Since the Javascript execution environment presents many ways of precisely manipulating memory layout, this vulnerability could be abused to cause further memory corruption, which can ultimately result in arbitrary code execution.
