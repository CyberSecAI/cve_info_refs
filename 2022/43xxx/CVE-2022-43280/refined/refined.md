The provided content is related to CVE-2022-43280.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `GetReturnCallDropKeepCount` function within the `wabt` (WebAssembly Binary Toolkit) project during the processing of a return call expression.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The `GetReturnCallDropKeepCount` function attempts to access data beyond the valid memory boundary, specifically within a `std::vector`. This happens when accessing the vector in the `size()` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read leads to a segmentation fault (SEGV), causing the program to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious WebAssembly binary: A specially crafted WebAssembly binary (`poc-interp-2.wasm`) triggers the vulnerability when parsed by `wabt`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious WebAssembly binary to the `wabt` tool.
