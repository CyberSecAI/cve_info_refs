The provided content is a security advisory from Swascan regarding vulnerabilities found in Telenia Software TVOX. It specifically mentions CVE-2022-43333 as related to a Blind OS Command Injection vulnerability.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `action_export_control.php` file, where user-supplied input via the `pid` parameter is not validated and is directly appended to a system command executed by the PHP `exec` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Blind OS Command Injection:** Unvalidated user input is directly used in a system command, enabling command injection.
    *   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerable script is accessible without requiring user authentication.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Remote code execution (RCE) is possible. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the webserver process.
    *   Attackers can upload a web shell, gain access to the internal network, and potentially compromise the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request to the `action_export_control.php` script, appending malicious OS commands to the `pid` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs network access to the TVOX web client.
    *   No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory also details two other vulnerabilities: Credenziali salvate in chiaro in file di configurazione, and Path Traversal which are not directly related to CVE-2022-43333.
*   The advisory includes a proof of concept, demonstrating how a command can be executed and how a web shell can be uploaded.
*   The advisory mentions that a fix is available in TVOX version 22.0.23.
