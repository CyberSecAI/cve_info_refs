Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the improper neutralization of user-controllable input within the "Users Alerts" feature of Rukovoditel v3.2.1. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the "Title" parameter when adding a new user alert.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious scripts injected by an attacker are persistently stored and executed when other users view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML within the victim's browser session. This can lead to a full compromise of the user, potentially including:
    *   Session hijacking/cookie theft
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the application
    *   Further attacks within the context of the user's session

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is network-based, requiring access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Specific Feature:**  The vulnerability is located within the "Users Alerts" feature, accessed through `/index.php?module=users_alerts/users_alerts`.
*   **Malicious Payload Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "Title" parameter when adding a new user alert.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Rukovoditel application.
*   **Access to the vulnerable feature:** The attacker needs to be able to access the "Users Alerts" feature to inject the payload.
*   **Basic web request understanding:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a request that includes the malicious script.

**Technical Details**
* The vulnerable parameter is the 'Title' field when creating a user alert.
* The proof of concept uses the following payload:  `<img src=1 onerror='alert(document.coookie)'/>`

**Additional Information**
* The issue was reported in github, where the reporter provided the steps to reproduce the issue, including screenshots.
