  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2022-43432",
    "description": "Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.\n\nXFramium Builder Plugin 1.0.22 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins as soon as it is loaded. This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.\n\nNOTE: Jenkins instances with Resource Root URL configured are unaffected.",
    "root_cause": "The XFramium Builder plugin globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The plugin disables the Content-Security-Policy header, which is intended to prevent XSS attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "Users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc. can perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By controlling files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control files in locations where Jenkins serves static content, such as workspaces or archived artifacts."
