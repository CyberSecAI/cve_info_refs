Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak occurs in the `ngap_handle_initial_ue_message` function within `src/amf/ngap-handler.c` of Open5gs.
- The function allocates memory for `ran_ue` structure using `ran_ue_add`, but fails to free this memory if `UserLocationInformation` is not present in the received `InitialUEMessage`, leading to a memory leak.
- Specifically, `ran_ue_remove` is not called in this scenario, causing the allocated memory to remain unreleased.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Each time an `InitialUEMessage` without `UserLocationInformation` is received, memory is allocated but not freed, which can lead to resource exhaustion.
- **Lack of proper error handling:** The code lacks the handling of cases where `UserLocationInformation` is not present. This causes the early return from the function without releasing allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Repeatedly sending malformed `InitialUEMessage` without `UserLocationInformation` will cause the AMF component of Open5gs to exhaust its memory resources as the `ran_ue_pool` is limited to a default of 1024. Once the pool is exhausted, AMF will crash. This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Packets:** An attacker can send specially crafted `InitialUEMessage` packets to the AMF that are missing the `UserLocationInformation` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the AMF to send the malformed packets. They don't need access to any other components.
- **Ability to craft NGAP messages:**  The attacker needs the ability to send NGAP messages and craft the `InitialUEMessage` without the required `UserLocationInformation` field.
