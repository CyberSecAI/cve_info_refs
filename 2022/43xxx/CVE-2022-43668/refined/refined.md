Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Typora fails to properly neutralize JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags (CWE-116). Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize or escape JavaScript code embedded within markdown files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when a user opens a maliciously crafted file in Typora. This could potentially lead to various malicious activities depending on the JavaScript code's capabilities, such as data theft, system manipulation, or further malware propagation.

**Attack vectors:**
* Opening a specially crafted markdown file containing malicious JavaScript code within Typora.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to create a malicious markdown file containing JavaScript code. The attacker needs to deliver this file to a Typora user, who must then open it using the vulnerable Typora application.
* The attack requires user interaction (opening the file).

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability is fixed in Typora version 1.4.4 and later.
* The CVSS v3 score is 4.4, with an attack vector of Local, Low complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, and limited impact on confidentiality and integrity.
* The CVSS v2 score is 4.3, with a Network attack vector, Medium complexity, no authentication required, and partial integrity impact.
