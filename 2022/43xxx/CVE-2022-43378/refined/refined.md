- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames. Specifically, external address frames are not properly restricted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-1021, Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could trick a user into performing unintended actions by manipulating rendered UI layers or frames. This could lead to unauthorized modification of device settings or other malicious actions performed by the user unknowingly. The impact is rated as High for integrity and no impact for confidentiality or availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction required (UI:R)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and needs to be able to send a crafted payload to the victim user via a network. The victim user needs to interact with the malicious UI to be impacted.
