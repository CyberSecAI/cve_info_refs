- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the StackStorm Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary script or HTML that may be executed in the Web UI of other logged in users.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by injecting malicious code through the pack rules feature in the Web UI, which requires write access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with write access to pack rules.
