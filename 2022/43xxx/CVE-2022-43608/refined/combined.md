### Vulnerability Mitigation /Remediation Against Buffer Overflow for Laser Printers and Small Office Multifunction Printers

November 25, 2022
Canon Inc.

A buffer overflow vulnerability was found for certain Canon Laser Printers and Small Office Multifunction Printers. (CVE-2022-43608)

This vulnerability indicates the possibility that if a product is connected directly to the Internet without using a router (wired or Wi-Fi), an unauthenticated remote attacker via the Internet may be able to execute arbitrary code and/or may be able to target the product in a Denial-of Service (DoS) attack.

It is recommended to set a private IP address for the products and create a network environment with a firewall or wired/Wi-Fi router that can restrict network access, please refer [here](/hardening/). Firmware designed to address this issue will be uploaded on websites of your local Canon sales representatives accordingly. Please be advised to update the firmware to the latest released version.
