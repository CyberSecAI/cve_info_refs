An Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') vulnerability in SUSE Rancher allows users in some higher-privileged groups to to inject code that is 
executed within another user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal 
sensitive information, manipulate web content, or perform other 
malicious activities on behalf of the victims. This could result in a 
user with write access to the affected areas being able to act on behalf
 of an administrator, once an administrator opens the affected web page.


This issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.0 before < 2.6.13, from >= 2.7.0 before < 2.7.4.
