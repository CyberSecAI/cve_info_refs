SSA-853037: File Parsing Vulnerabilities in Parasolid

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2022-11-08
2022-11-08
V1.0

SUMMARY

Parasolid is affected by out of bounds read/write vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application
reads ﬁles in X_T format. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected applications, an
attacker could leverage the vulnerability to perform remote code execution in the context of the current
process.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Parasolid is a 3D geometric modeling tool that supports various techniques, including solid modeling,
direct editing, and free-form surface/sheet modeling.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-39157

The affected application contains an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated structure while
parsing specially crafted X_T ﬁles. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-17745)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-43397

The affected application contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated buffer while
parsing specially crafted X_T ﬁles. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the
current process. (ZDI-CAN-17854)
