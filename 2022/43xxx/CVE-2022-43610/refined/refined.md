- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of GIF images, leading to a read past the end of an allocated object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability in combination with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a malicious GIF file or visiting a malicious page containing a malicious GIF image.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious GIF file or a webpage containing a malicious GIF file, and the user has to open that file or visit the malicious webpage.
