- Root cause of vulnerability: The application does not properly sanitize the "idPagina" parameter in the "ApriPopup.do" endpoint. Specifically, the application attempts to sanitize the input but fails to block all potentially harmful HTML attributes.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The "idPagina" parameter is reflected in the server's response without proper HTML encoding.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a victim's browser, allowing them to potentially steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other actions within the context of the victim's authenticated session.
- Attack vectors: The attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the payload within the `idPagina` parameter, and then induce a victim to visit this URL.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload and have the victim visit this crafted URL.
