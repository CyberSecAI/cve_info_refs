The provided content is related to CVE-2022-44014.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Faulty API design.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The API allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary SQL table name, which can be queried.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can fetch arbitrary SQL tables, leading to the leakage of user passwords and MSSQL hashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/DS/LM_API/api/SelectionService/GetPaggedTab` endpoint with a modified "ResultTab" object specifying the table to be queried.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Only a valid username is required, as the authentication is bypassed.
