Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The content demonstrates the ability to upload a PHP file, which allows for the execution of arbitrary code, indicating a lack of proper file upload validation or sanitization within the Zenar CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The vulnerability allows for uploading a file without authentication, directly exposing the system to malicious uploads.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP file, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can gain complete control of the web server by executing malicious code, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** The attacker sends an HTTP request to upload the malicious file directly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable server, as no authentication is required for the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided images and description show how an attacker can upload a `shell.php` file containing a simple system command execution, and then access this file via the web browser to execute the command.
* The specific version of Zenar CMS mentioned is 9.3.
