# TRENDNet AP buffer overflow vulnerabilities

[![image-20221027101724040](/johnawm/vulner-box/raw/master/TRENDNet/TEW-820AP/image-20221027101724040.png)](/johnawm/vulner-box/blob/master/TRENDNet/TEW-820AP/image-20221027101724040.png)

## Overview

* Type: buffer overflow
* Supplier: TRENDNet (<https://www.trendnet.com/>)
* Product: TRENDNet TEW-820AP (Version v1.0R)
* Firmware download: [https://downloads.trendnet.com/tew-820ap/firmware/tew-820apv1\_(fw1.01b01).zip](https://downloads.trendnet.com/tew-820ap/firmware/tew-820apv1_%28fw1.01b01%29.zip)
* affect version: TRENDNet TEW-820AP 1.01.B01

## Description

### 1. Vulnerability Details

A stack overflow vulnerability exists in TrendNet Wireless AC Easy-Upgrader TEW-820AP (Version v1.0R, firmware version 1.01.B01) which may result in remote code execution or denial of service. The issue exists in the binary "boa" which resides in "/bin" folder, and the binary is responsible for serving http connection received by the device. While processing the post reuqest "/boafrm/formSystemCheck", the value of "ipv4\_ping" parameter which can be arbitrarily long is copied onto stack memory by "sprintf" function (as shown at line 20 of Figure B), and could lead to a buffer overflow. The attackers can construct a payload to carry out arbitrary code attacks.

### 2. Reproduce and POC

To reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Start frimware through QEMU system or other methods (real device)
2. Use the default username and password to login web.
3. Execute the poc script POC\_for\_formSystemCheck.py as follows:
