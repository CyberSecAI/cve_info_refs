- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in the "Handy Tip" macro of the "Handy Macros for Confluence" plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code in the "Handy Tip" macro.

This could lead to various malicious activities, such as data theft, session hijacking, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript and injects it into the "Handy Tip" macro content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to edit or create pages in Confluence and add the "Handy Tip" macro with the malicious payload.
