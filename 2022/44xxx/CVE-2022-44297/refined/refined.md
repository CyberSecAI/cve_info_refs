The provided content is related to a SQL injection vulnerability, and while it does not explicitly mention CVE-2022-44297, it is associated with a similar vulnerability in sscms (SiteServer CMS) version 7.1.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient input sanitization when processing table names within the `LayerEditorController.Submit.cs` in the `update` function and also in the `RepositoryUtils.Insert.cs`'s `InsertObjectAsync` method. Specifically, the `tableName` parameter from a POST request is directly inserted into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The lack of input sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL code.
- **Direct SQL query construction:** The application constructs the SQL query by directly concatenating the user supplied `tableName` parameter into the SQL statement, instead of using parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, or even complete system compromise.
- In this specific case, the user demonstrates the ability to use `extractvalue` to extract database information, which shows the impact and severity of the injection vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/admin/common/tableStyle/layerEditor` endpoint.
- **JSON Payload:** The vulnerability is triggered via the `tableName` parameter within the JSON payload of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must have access to the `/api/admin/common/tableStyle/layerEditor` endpoint. This often requires being logged in as a backend/admin user due to authorization checks.
- They also require knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`tableName`).
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request with a manipulated `tableName` value.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in the `sscms` version 7.1.3 with a MySQL database in the background admin context.
- The vulnerability is located in the `SSCMS.Web\Controllers\Admin\Common\TableStyle\LayerEditorController.Submit.cs` and the `cms-sscms-v7.1.3\src\Datory\Utils\RepositoryUtils.Insert.cs` files.
- The fix was implemented in version 7.2.0.
