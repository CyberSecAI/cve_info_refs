This vulnerability may cause the modification of personal information such as administrator password, mobile phone number, and email address. To exploit this vulnerability, a constructed HTML file needs to be opened. 1、Go to the back office - > personal information [图片1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198805600-647f7444-43de-4f24-bc6f-d5bbb9b2b3df.png) [图片2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198805663-e2201462-1adb-41f1-9af4-33972ad314f0.png) The password is “admin123456” 2、Construct a request package to change passwords, mobile phone numbers, email addresses, and other basic information. [图片3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198806546-09371725-758a-44a7-afa9-17a6b092a35b.png) The above figure shows the constructed web page code, using CSRF to change its password to "csrftest", the mobile phone number to "11111111111", and the email address to "123@csrf.test". 3、View the administrator's profile: [图片4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198807952-63991501-10fc-4b47-a14c-e24f9e95ada8.png) At this time, the administrator password is "admin123456", and other information is shown in the preceding figure. 4、Click on the constructed web page. [图片5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198812728-5c5a42e8-4c83-4632-9b69-8534d8acb298.png) Return to the backend page to view the administrator's profile.
