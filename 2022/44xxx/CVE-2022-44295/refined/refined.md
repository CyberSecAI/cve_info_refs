The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Sanitization Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `assign_team.php` file, specifically the `id` parameter in the URL. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to a lack of proper input sanitization/validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter. In this case, the attacker demonstrates the ability to leak the database name. This could lead to sensitive data exposure, modification, or deletion.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/php-sms/admin/orders/assign_team.php` file, injecting SQL code in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication appears to be required to reach the vulnerable endpoint.
- Knowledge of the application's structure, specifically that it is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter.
