- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the `/api/admin/cms/templates/templatesAssetsEditor` endpoint, specifically within the `TemplatesAssetsEditorController.Get.cs` file. The `fileName` parameter is directly passed to the `ReadTextAsync` method without any sanitization or filtering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file read vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization and path traversal vulnerability via directory traversal sequences (`..%5C`) in the `fileName` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted GET request to the `/api/admin/cms/templates/templatesAssetsEditor` endpoint with a malicious `fileName` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrator privileges and be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker also requires knowledge of the system's file paths.
