- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The WordPress Quick Restaurant Reservations plugin versions 1.5.4 and earlier are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing malicious actors to potentially force authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a Cross-Site Request Forgery, where a malicious actor tricks a user into making an unwanted request on a vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to visit a malicious website or click on a malicious link that triggers the request to the vulnerable plugin. The user must be logged in to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker does not need to authenticate.
