SUMMARY

SIMATIC WinCC OA contains an argument injection vulnerability that could allow an authenticated remote
attacker to inject arbitrary parameters, when starting the Ultralight Client via the web interface (e.g., open
attacker chosen panels with the attacker’s credentials or start a Ctrl script).

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products
where updates are not, or not yet available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC Open Architecture (OA) is part of the SIMATIC HMI family. It is designed for use in
applications requiring a high degree of customer-speciﬁc adaptability, large or complex applications and
projects that impose speciﬁc system requirements or functions.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-44731

The affected component allows to inject custom arguments to the Ultralight Client backend application
under certain circumstances.

This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to inject arbitrary parameters when starting the
client via the web interface (e.g., open attacker chosen panels with the attacker’s credentials or start a
Ctrl script).
