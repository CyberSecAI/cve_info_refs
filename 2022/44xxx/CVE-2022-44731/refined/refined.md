- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the affected component allowing the injection of custom arguments to the Ultralight Client backend application. This occurs when starting the client via the web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is improper neutralization of argument delimiters in a command, specifically an "Argument Injection" (CWE-88). This allows for the injection of arbitrary parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an authenticated remote attacker to inject arbitrary parameters. This can result in actions like opening attacker-chosen panels using the attacker's credentials, or executing a Ctrl script. The impact is rated as low for Confidentiality and Integrity and none for Availability, based on the CVSS score.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attacker must be authenticated with low privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction is required (UI:N). The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged (S:U).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated and have network access to the affected system. They need to be able to interact with the web interface to trigger the Ultralight Client.
