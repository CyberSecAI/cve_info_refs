Root cause of vulnerability:
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user-supplied input in the `username` parameter within the `/avms/index.php` file. Specifically, the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize the input before using it in a SQL query.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which can be exploited by injecting malicious SQL code into the vulnerable `username` parameter.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can use SQL injection to potentially:
- Bypass authentication
- Read sensitive data from the database
- Modify or delete data
- Execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to `/avms/index.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `username` parameter.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No specific privileges or positions within the system are necessary. The attacker only needs access to the application's login form.
