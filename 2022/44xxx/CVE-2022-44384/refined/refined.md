```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows arbitrary file uploads via the vendor logo functionality, without proper validation of the file type or content. This enables an attacker to upload a PHP file containing malicious code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary File Upload",
    "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "Insecure direct object reference: vendor logo file path"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is carried out by first logging into the application, then uploading a malicious PHP file through the vendor logo upload feature. Afterwards, the attacker can execute the uploaded file using a direct GET request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "The attacker needs valid credentials to log into the application (default admin/admin credentials can be used if not changed).",
    "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the server.",
    "The attacker must have network connectivity to the target system."
