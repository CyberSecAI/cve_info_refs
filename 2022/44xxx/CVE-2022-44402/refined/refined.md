Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `delete_transaction` function within the `/asms/classes/Master.php` file. The `id` parameter is directly included in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it uses user-supplied input (`id` parameter) directly in a SQL query without sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Information Disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, including database names, usernames, password hashes, and other data stored within tables.
- Data Manipulation: By injecting SQL code, an attacker could potentially modify or delete data, or create new data entries leading to data corruption.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: In some SQL injection cases (depending on the database system and configuration), attackers can gain code execution on the server.
- Privilege Escalation: If a less-privileged user account can exploit the injection, they can potentially escalate privileges to super admin level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The attack is performed through an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable file `asms/classes/Master.php` with the function parameter `f=delete_transaction`.
- Vulnerable Parameter: The `id` parameter in the POST request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint: The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable file and parameter (`/asms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_transaction` and the `id` parameter).
- Ability to Craft Malicious SQL Payload: The attacker needs the ability to craft and inject SQL payloads into the vulnerable `id` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit uses the `updatexml` function to leak the database name, which is a specific SQL injection technique used in MySQL.
- The provided example payload `id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` demonstrates how to extract the database name.
- The vulnerable software is identified as "Automotive Shop Management System v1.0" by oretnom23, and its source code is hosted on `sourcecodester.com`.
- The github repository `https://github.com/acvxd/bug_report` demonstrates this vulnerability.
