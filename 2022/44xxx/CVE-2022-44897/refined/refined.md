Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the `Ap PageBuilder` module of the Prestashop theme. Specifically, the `show_number` parameter in the `apajax.php` file is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied input (`show_number` parameter) directly into the HTML output without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `show_number` parameter. When a victim visits the crafted URL, their browser will execute the attacker's script.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal cookies, potentially hijacking user sessions.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker could redirect users to a phishing page.
*   **Website Defacement:** Alter the content and appearance of the website.
*   **Information Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to a specific URL (`/modules/appagebuilder/apajax.php`)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to trick a victim into accessing the crafted URL. This can be through social engineering, malicious links, or other methods.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Component:** The `Ap PageBuilder` module of the Prestashop theme
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `show_number`
*   **Vulnerable File:** `modules/appagebuilder/apajax.php`
*   **Affected Versions:** `Ap PageBuilder` module versions up to and including 2.4.4
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided GitHub content gives the following example:
    `http://localhost/modules/appagebuilder/apajax.php?rand=1663014854193&widget=ApImageGallery&show_number={XSS_HERE}`
    where `{XSS_HERE}` would be replaced by the malicious payload.
