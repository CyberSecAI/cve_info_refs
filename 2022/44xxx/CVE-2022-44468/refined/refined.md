Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-44468:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This occurs when user-supplied input is reflected back to the user without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application by crafting a malicious URL.
- The attack requires a low level of privilege (PR:L). The attacker needs some level of user access to the application in order to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R). The victim must click a malicious link or interact with a page containing the injected script.
- The vulnerability has a scope change (S:C), meaning the injected code executes within the security context of the application and can access resources beyond the attacker's.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the malicious script.
- The attacker also needs to lure the victim into clicking this malicious link, or otherwise interact with a page that contains the injected script.

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N

**Severity:** Important
