- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A segmentation fault occurs in the `aout_add_gotoff_reloc` function within the NASM assembler when processing a crafted assembly file. The issue appears to be related to how the assembler handles `..gotoff` relocations, specifically when a non-global symbol is not present in the section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a crash due to a segmentation fault when processing specific assembly code utilizing `..gotoff` relocations incorrectly. The ASAN report indicates a read memory access on a null address, which occurs inside the `aout_add_gotoff_reloc` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation of the vulnerability will lead to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the NASM assembler.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted assembly file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by NASM.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted assembly file as input to the NASM assembler. This would typically involve the attacker running the assembler on the malicious file.
