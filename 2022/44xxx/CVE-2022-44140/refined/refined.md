  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter within the member edit functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can operate on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the '/index.php/admins/Member/memberedit.html' endpoint with a crafted 'id' parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be logged into the application's backend with access to the user management features. No special network position is required. Knowledge of the application's URL structure and parameter handling is necessary to exploit the SQL injection"
