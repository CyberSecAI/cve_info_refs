The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Sanitization Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `id` parameter in the `/php-sms/admin/quotes/manage_remark.php` file before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection. The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (e.g., extracting database names, user credentials, sensitive information).
  - Data modification or deletion.
  - Potential for further system compromise if the database user has sufficient privileges.
  - In this specific case, the example payload extracts the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/php-sms/admin/quotes/manage_remark.php` with a crafted `id` parameter containing SQL injection payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`id`).
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated, as there's no mention of the need for authentication to access the vulnerable endpoint, only the login credentials used for analysis purposes.
