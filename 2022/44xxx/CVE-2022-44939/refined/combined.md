## [The Global Lottery Craze: Why People Are Playing to Win](https://www.echatserver.com/the-global-lottery-craze-why-people-are-playing-to-win/)

The lottery has become a global phenomenon. With massive jackpots, exciting prizes, and the promise of life-changing wealth, millions of people around the world are buying lottery tickets every day. Whether it’s the Powerball in the U.S., EuroMillions in Europe, or national lotteries in countries across the globe, the allure of winning big has drawn people into the world of lottery games for decades. Thanks to digital platforms like **[DEWAKOIN](https://lottafoundation.com/)**, it’s easier than ever for players to get involved in the lottery craze, with access to international lotteries at their fingertips.

### **Why People Play the Lottery**

The reasons why people play the lottery are as varied as the players themselves. But there are a few common factors that contribute to the global fascination with lotteries:

1. **The Dream of a Better Life**
   For many players, the lottery represents the ultimate chance to change their lives. The idea of winning a multi-million-dollar jackpot and being financially free is a dream that drives millions to participate. With the right mindset and a little luck, a single lottery ticket could lead to an unimaginable fortune, opening the door to new opportunities, experiences, and freedom.
2. **Low Cost, High Reward**
   The cost of a lottery ticket is relatively low, making it accessible to almost anyone. For just a few dollars, players can take part in a game that offers a chance to win life-changing amounts of money. This low cost and the possibility of winning big make the lottery an enticing option for people looking to try their luck.
3. **Excitement and Entertainment**
   Playing the lottery isn’t just about winning—many people enjoy the thrill of participating. The excitement of watching the draw, imagining what they would do with the prize money, and hoping for that winning combination provides entertainment value. It’s a fun escape, and the possibility of winning keeps players coming back.
4. **The Allure of Big Jackpots**
   Lotteries often offer enormous jackpots that grow to eye-popping amounts. Whether it’s Powerball or EuroMillions, these massive prizes draw millions of players who are eager to win big. As the jackpots increase, so does the excitement and anticipation surrounding the next drawing.
5. **A Chance to Dream Big**
   For many, playing the lottery is about more than just the money—it’s about the dream. Even those who don’t win big may find joy in imagining the possibilities of what they could do with a substantial fortune. The lottery gives people hope and excitement for a better future.

### **How Technology Is Fueling the Global Lottery Craze**

With the rise of digital technology, playing the lottery has never been easier. Online platforms like **DEWAKOIN** allow players to access lotteries from all over the world, making it simple to participate in global jackpots.

You can log into **[DEWAKOIN](https://lottafoundation.com/)**, purchase tickets for international lotteries like EuroMillions or Powerball, and follow the draws—all from the comfort of your home.

Digital platforms have also made it easier for players to join lottery pools, purchase multiple tickets, and receive automatic updates on jackpot sizes. This has expanded the reach of lotteries and encouraged more people to participate, creating a truly global lottery market. **DEWAKOIN** enhances this experience by offering a safe and secure platform that connects players to global lotteries and ensures a seamless user experience.

### **The Psychological Appeal of the Lottery**

The psychological pull of the lottery is another reason why it’s so popular worldwide. The concept of luck and fate plays a big role in the lottery’s appeal. Many players believe they’re “due” for a win or have a lucky feeling about certain numbers. The thought that winning could be just around the corner makes each draw feel thrilling, and the excitement keeps players coming back.

Lottery games also tap into the idea of “hope.” They provide players with the opportunity to dream big, to imagine a life without financial worries. It’s not just about winning the money—it’s about the possibilities that come with it. This psychological appeal is one of the reasons why so many people around the world continue to play the lottery.

### **Global Lottery Markets and Growth**

The global lottery market has been steadily growing for years, with a projected market value of over **$100 billion** in the next few years. This growth is largely fueled by the rise of digital platforms and the increasing popularity of online gambling. Players from different regions can now easily participate in lotteries that were once exclusive to certain countries or regions.

Platforms like **DEWAKOIN** are key players in this transformation, offering players worldwide the chance to participate in global lotteries. By offering access to international lotteries, **DEWAKOIN** is helping to expand the appeal of these games and encouraging more players to take part.

Setting a budget and sticking to it is essential to ensure that your participation remains enjoyable and doesn’t affect your financial stability.

## [The #1 Powerball Winning Strategy Experts Use](https://www.echatserver.com/the-1-powerball-winning-strategy-experts-use/)

Powerball is one of the most exciting lottery games, with jackpots that can reach hundreds of millions of dollars. The chance to win such a massive sum of money is a dream come true for many players. But with odds of 1 in 292 million, winning the Powerball is a tough feat. Despite these daunting odds, there are strategies that can increase your chances of winning—at least slightly. In this article, we will explore the #1 Powerball winning strategy used by experts and how **[DEWAKOIN](https://dewakoins.com/)** can help you implement it for a better shot at winning.

### **Understanding the Powerball Odds**

Before diving into strategies, it’s essential to understand the odds of winning Powerball. The odds of winning the jackpot are **1 in 292,201,338**. While the odds are slim, Powerball still offers multiple ways to win, with prizes for matching just a few numbers. The key to improving your odds lies in the strategy you employ, as even small changes in your approach can increase your chances over time.

### **The #1 Strategy: Consistent Play and Smart Ticket Selection**

The most effective strategy for improving your chances of winning Powerball is consistency. Powerball experts recommend playing consistently and picking numbers strategically. This strategy involves selecting numbers that are less commonly chosen by other players to avoid sharing the jackpot, should you win. Additionally, sticking to a regular schedule of ticket purchases is key.

With **DEWAKOIN**, players can set up recurring purchases for each draw, ensuring that they never miss out on an opportunity to win. Whether you choose your own numbers or opt for Quick Pick, **DEWAKOIN** makes it easy to stay consistent without worrying about missing a draw.

### **The Power of Playing More Tickets**

One of the most common tips for increasing your chances of winning Powerball is buying more tickets. While buying a single ticket gives you the chance to win, purchasing more tickets increases the number of potential winning combinations. In fact, experts say that buying multiple tickets, particularly through lottery pools, is an effective way to boost your odds.

**[DEWAKOIN](https://dewakoins.com/)** allows you to join or organize lottery pools, which is a great way to purchase more tickets without increasing your personal cost. Pooling your money with others allows you to play more combinations, significantly improving your chances of winning.

### **Choosing the Right Numbers: Is There a Pattern?**

While Powerball is a game of chance, many players and experts believe that some numbers are drawn more often than others. Some players choose their numbers based on personal significance—like birthdays, anniversaries, or lucky numbers. Others prefer to use statistical analysis, looking at past winning numbers to identify patterns.

There’s no proven strategy that guarantees success in picking the winning numbers, but experts suggest balancing the selection of high and low numbers. Typically, players who choose a mix of numbers from across the entire range (1-69 for the main numbers and 1-26 for the Powerball) have better odds than those who focus on just one part of the range.

With **DEWAKOIN**, players can quickly view historical results and track trends to help inform their number choices. Whether you stick to lucky numbers or choose randomly, **DEWAKOIN** helps guide your decision-making.

### **Why You Should Play Responsibly**

It’s crucial to play the lottery responsibly. While the potential payout is enormous, the odds are extremely low, and it’s important to set a budget and stick to it. **DEWAKOIN** helps you manage your spending with features that allow you to set limits on how much you wish to spend. The platform makes it easy to enjoy Powerball while keeping your gaming experience fun and responsible.

3. **Choose Your Numbers Wisely**

4. **Don’t Forget the Lucky Stars**
   The Lucky Stars are key to winning the jackpot. Many players focus on the main numbers, but don’t forget to select your two Lucky Stars as well. They play a crucial role in securing the top prize, so make sure to give them equal attention when filling out your ticket.

## [Crack the Pick 3 Code: Tips to Win More Frequently](https://www.echatserver.com/crack-the-pick-3-code-tips-to-win-more-frequently/)

The Pick 3 lottery game is one of the most popular and accessible games in the lottery world. With smaller jackpots and relatively simple rules, it offers a lot of opportunities for players to win more frequently. While the odds may not be as favorable as some larger lottery games, strategic play, a good understanding of the game, and proper tools can increase your chances of success. Platforms like **[DEWAKOIN](https://punefestival.com/)** provide a comprehensive and secure way to play Pick 3, giving players tools and insights to improve their chances of winning.

### **Understanding the Basics of Pick 3**

In Pick 3, players select three numbers between 0 and 9. After that, a drawing takes place, and if your chosen numbers match the results in the correct order, you win! The simplicity of Pick 3 makes it incredibly popular among both new and experienced players. Many lottery enthusiasts enjoy the game because of the frequency of drawings and the relatively low cost per ticket, making it a great choice for regular players.

While the concept is straightforward, there are several tips and strategies that can give you an edge when playing Pick 3. With **DEWAKOIN**, you have access to resources and tools that help you stay informed about trends, patterns, and odds, so you can make smarter decisions when choosing your numbers.

### **Tip 1: Study Past Drawings and Trends**

One of the best ways to approach Pick 3 is to study past results and trends. By analyzing previous winning numbers, you may notice patterns or recurring numbers that could help guide your selections. While lottery outcomes are always random, some players believe that past numbers can influence future draws.

**[DEWAKOIN](https://punefestival.com/)** offers tools that allow players to track historical Pick 3 data, helping you identify patterns that could increase your chances. By using the trend analysis features, you can make more informed choices instead of simply picking numbers at random.

### **Tip 2: Use a Balanced Mix of Numbers**

Many experienced players recommend using a mix of odd and even numbers when selecting your Pick 3 numbers. The majority of winning combinations in Pick 3 tend to include a combination of both odd and even numbers. By balancing your choices, you improve your chances of having a winning combination.

You can also mix high and low numbers. Some players use the strategy of choosing one number from each group: one low number (0-4), one middle number (5-6), and one high number (7-9). This balanced approach has helped many players achieve consistent wins over time.

**DEWAKOIN** also provides helpful tips and resources to ensure that you are making smart choices when selecting your numbers, helping you stay on track with your strategy.

### **Tip 3: Play Consistently, but Manage Your Budget**

Like any lottery game, consistency can pay off in Pick 3. If you are playing regularly, you are more likely to hit a winning combination over time. However, it’s essential to manage your budget. Playing consistently doesn’t mean overextending yourself financially. By sticking to a manageable budget, you can play for a longer period, increasing your chances of eventually winning without risking too much.

Platforms like **DEWAKOIN** make it easy for players to track their spending and set limits, ensuring responsible play. With tools designed to help you monitor your budget, you can play Pick 3 in a way that is both fun and financially responsible.

### **Tip 4: Use the Box Bet Option**

In Pick 3, there are various ways to bet on your numbers. One popular option is the **Box Bet**, which allows your numbers to be arranged in any order. If you win with a Box Bet, your prize is typically smaller than with an exact order bet, but the chances of winning are significantly higher.

If you’re looking for frequent wins, consider using the Box Bet strategy. It’s a great option if you want to increase your chances of winning without needing your numbers to match in a specific order. **DEWAKOIN** offers various betting options, including the Box Bet, making it easier for players to explore and use different strategies.

### **Tip 5: Join a Lottery Pool**

Another effective strategy for increasing your odds of winning Pick 3 is to join a lottery pool. By pooling your money with others, you can purchase more tickets and increase the number of chances you have to win. While you may share the prize if you win, joining a pool allows you to participate in more drawings without spending more money.

**DEWAKOIN** helps you organize or join lottery pools, making it easier for you to increase your chances of winning without additional risk. With their user-friendly platform, joining a pool and playing with others has never been easier.

### **The Bottom Line: Have Fun and Play Smart**

While no strategy can guarantee a win in Pick 3, combining these tips and using platforms like **[DEWAKOIN](https://punefestival.com/)** can improve your odds and help you play more strategically. By understanding the game, analyzing trends, managing your budget, and playing consistently, you can enjoy Pick 3 while maximizing your chances of success.

Remember, the lottery is ultimately a game of chance, and the most important thing is to enjoy the experience. Play responsibly, use smart strategies, and most importantly, have fun with your Pick 3 journey.

## [The Surprising Truth About Quick Pick vs. Self-Picked Lottery Numbers](https://www.echatserver.com/the-surprising-truth-about-quick-pick-vs-self-picked-lottery-numbers/)

For many lottery players, choosing numbers is part of the excitement, but the method they use can vary greatly. Some players swear by **Quick Pick**, while others believe they have better luck with numbers they’ve personally selected. But does the method you use really make a difference in winning the jackpot? Let’s dive into the surprising truth about Quick Pick vs. self-picked lottery numbers and how platforms like **DEWAKOIN** can help streamline your lottery experience.

### **Quick Pick: The Convenience Factor**

**Quick Pick** is a popular option for players who want to avoid the hassle of selecting their own numbers. Instead, the system automatically generates a random set of numbers for the player, offering convenience and simplicity. **DEWAKOIN** offers Quick Pick as part of its user-friendly lottery services, allowing players to get started quickly without any extra effort.

One of the biggest advantages of Quick Pick is that it eliminates human bias. When picking numbers, people often choose numbers based on personal preferences, birthdates, or lucky numbers, which can result in more commonly chosen combinations. With Quick Pick, you’re less likely to end up with the same combination as others, which can lead to a smaller prize pool in the event of a win.

### **Self-Picked Numbers: The Personal Touch**

On the other hand, **self-picked numbers** involve choosing your own set of numbers based on personal preferences, such as important dates, lucky numbers, or numbers that have appeared frequently in past draws. Some players believe that self-picking numbers gives them a greater sense of control over their fate and that it might increase their chances of winning.

However, statistically speaking, picking your own numbers doesn’t increase or decrease your odds of winning. Lottery draws are designed to be random, so every combination has an equal chance of winning. Despite this, many players feel a deeper connection to their self-chosen numbers, which adds an emotional component to the game.

### **What Does the Data Say?**

Studies have shown that there’s no real difference between Quick Pick and self-picked numbers in terms of winning odds. The numbers are drawn randomly, so all combinations have an equal chance. However, a significant factor to consider is the likelihood of sharing the prize. Because many people choose numbers like birthdays, certain numbers tend to appear more often. This means that if you do win with self-picked numbers, there’s a higher chance you’ll have to split the prize with others who chose the same combination.

With **Quick Pick**, because the numbers are randomly generated, players are less likely to share their winnings, which means they could end up with a larger share of the jackpot if they win. This is why many lottery players prefer Quick Pick when they want to avoid the possibility of splitting their prize.

## [Against All Odds: How Lottery Winners Beat the Odds](https://www.echatserver.com/against-all-odds-how-lottery-winners-beat-the-odds/)

Winning the lottery is a dream that many people around the world share, but the odds of actually hitting the jackpot can feel insurmountable. For example, the Powerball jackpot offers odds of 1 in 292 million. These odds are stacked against players, yet every year, there are winners who beat the odds and make their lottery dreams a reality. How do they do it? Is it sheer luck, or is there a strategy to beating the odds?

While there’s no surefire method to guarantee a win, there are several factors and strategies that can increase your chances and perhaps even help you defy the seemingly impossible odds. Whether it’s choosing the right numbers, being consistent with playing, or simply playing in a group, lottery winners around the world have found ways to tilt the odds in their favor. Additionally, platforms like **[DEWAKOIN](https://aakro.com/)** are making it easier for people to enter lotteries, increasing the accessibility and opportunities for more players to try their luck.

### **Understanding the Odds**

When it comes to winning the lottery, the odds are steep. In games like Powerball, the odds of hitting the jackpot are 1 in 292 million, while other games like Mega Millions have odds of about 1 in 302 million. This means the likelihood of winning is incredibly small. But despite these odds, many people win, sometimes against all expectations.

While we may never truly understand why some people win and others don’t, there’s one thing that every winner has in common: persistence. People who win lotteries often don’t do so on a whim. They are typically regular players who believe in their chance to win, and they keep playing until they hit it big. This persistence is essential, and **[DEWAKOIN](https://aakro.com/)** offers a platform where players can easily keep track of their tickets, subscribe to regular drawings, and participate in lotteries without any hassle, all from one secure place.

### **Persistence and Strategy: How Some Winners Defy the Odds**

Some winners claim that their success came from sticking to a strategy, while others say they simply got lucky. Either way, there are some common threads that successful lottery players share.

One of the most common strategies is playing consistently. Many players buy tickets for every draw, whether it’s a small local lottery or a huge jackpot game like Powerball. By purchasing tickets for every drawing, they’re constantly increasing their chances of winning over time. Persistence doesn’t guarantee success, but it does increase the likelihood that you’ll eventually hit it big. Some people set aside a small portion of their budget each week to buy lottery tickets, and they do so without expecting to win every time. On platforms like **DEWAKOIN**, players can automate their participation in ongoing lotteries, making it easier to stick to this winning strategy without missing any chances.

Another strategy involves choosing your numbers thoughtfully. Many players believe that there is an advantage to selecting certain numbers, either by following patterns or picking numbers with personal significance. However, the lottery is ultimately a game of chance, so there’s no guaranteed formula to pick the winning numbers. The real advantage comes from purchasing more tickets, and this is where pooling your resources with others can help.

### **The Power of Pooling Resources**

One of the most effective strategies for increasing your chances of winning is joining a lottery pool. By pooling resources with others, you can buy more tickets, increasing your odds of winning without spending more money. In a pool, everyone contributes a small amount of money and shares in the prize if any one ticket wins. Many groups form in workplaces, among friends, or even in online communities. By pooling your money, you can buy more tickets, and thus increase the number of chances you have to win.

**DEWAKOIN** allows players to organize and join lottery pools with ease. This makes it more accessible for individuals to collaborate and increase their chances of winning. Whether you’re joining a local pool or connecting with others online, pooling resources can be an effective way to improve your odds.

### **The Role of Luck in Winning**

No matter what strategies you use, luck is still the main factor in winning the lottery. Even if you follow every strategy and play consistently, there’s still no way to predict which numbers will be drawn. However, as most winners will tell you, they didn’t win by waiting for luck alone. They believed in the process, kept playing, and remained optimistic. Luck, in the end, may favor those who don’t give up.

There’s no denying that luck plays a big part in lottery winnings. In fact, some of the most notable lottery winners have been people who simply tried their luck with no expectation of winning. Cynthia P. Stafford, for example, won $112 million in the California Mega Millions jackpot in 2007, a life-changing amount. She is often quoted as saying she visualized herself winning before it happened, believing that if she kept playing, her dreams would eventually come true.

### **Lottery Technology: Changing the Game**

While luck is a major factor, new technology is also making it easier for players to play and improve their chances. Online platforms like **DEWAKOIN** make it easier than ever to participate in lotteries, track your numbers, and even participate in digital lottery pools. The convenience and security offered by online platforms give players the ability to join more games, buy more tickets, and track their winnings in real-time.

Technology also helps players stay engaged and focused. With mobile apps and automated services, players can participate in multiple lotteries without having to manually buy tickets or fill out forms every time. **DEWAKOIN** offers a variety of lottery options, providing players with a seamless and enjoyable experience.

### **Real-Life Winners and Their Stories**

Lottery winners often share stories about their journeys. Many claim that it wasn’t just luck, but a series of decisions and strategies that got them there. These success stories often focus on the winners’ persistence, patience, and optimism, even when the odds seemed insurmountable.

It’s also important to note that winning the lottery doesn’t always lead to a perfect life. Some winners have struggled with managing their newfound wealth, while others have used their money to change the world around them. Regardless, their stories remind us that while the odds are tough, beating them isn’t entirely impossible.

### **Conclusion: Your Shot at Beating the Odds**

Although the odds of winning the lottery are slim, it’s clear that some people manage to defy the statistics. Persistence, strategy, and a little bit of luck can increase your chances, and platforms like **[DEWAKOIN](https://aakro.com/)** make it easier for players to stay involved and strategic. Whether you choose to play consistently, join a pool, or simply try your luck, there’s always a chance for you to be the next big winner.

## Understanding Lottery Playing Patterns

**Lottery playing patterns** are shaped by many factors. These include peak and off-**peak playing times**. People often play the lottery at certain times, like during busy hours or on specific days. They believe these times are luckier.

Research shows players have unique patterns. Some play more during busy times, while others prefer quieter days. Knowing these patterns can help players choose the best times to play and boost their chances of winning.

### Peak vs. Off-Peak Playing Times

Peak and off-peak times are key to understanding lottery patterns. Peak times are usually weekends or holidays, when more people play. Off-peak times are weekdays, with fewer players. By studying these times, players can find the best moments to play and up their winning odds.

Lottery patterns differ by game and player preferences. For example, some games attract more players during peak times, while others have a steady player base all week. By grasping these patterns and adjusting their play, players can enhance their lottery experience.

By studying lottery patterns and **timing** psychology, players can craft winning strategies. Whether playing during busy or quiet times, staying informed and adapting to changing patterns is crucial.

## Statistical Analysis of Winning Days

To find the best days to play the lottery, we need to do a *statistical analysis* of *winning days*. Looking at the data and trends helps us spot patterns. This can boost our chances of winning. Studies show the odds of winning the lottery are low, with Powerball being 1 in 24.87.

Understanding the probability of winning on different days is key. While no day is proven luckier than others, some research hints at factors like player numbers and jackpot size. For instance, big jackpots draw more players, changing the winning odds.

* The odds of winning the Powerball Grand Prize are 1 in 292,201,338.
* The chances of winning any prize in Lotto 6/49 are 1 in 6.6.
* The expected return of a $33 million jackpot in Lotto 6/49 was as high as -$0.14, showing a linear relationship.

By studying these stats and trends, we can better understand *winning days*. This knowledge helps us decide when to play the lottery. Though winning is never guaranteed, a detailed *statistical analysis* can improve our chances.

## The Science Behind Lucky Days and Numbers

Exploring the science of **lucky days** and numbers is quite complex. It involves looking at things like **chronobiological factors** and mathematical patterns. Many believe that certain days or numbers can bring them luck. When it comes to the lottery, people often pick numbers based on **lucky days** or special numbers.

Studying **chronobiological factors** can show how our bodies react at different times. This knowledge can help us pick the best days to play the lottery. Mathematical patterns also play a role, helping us understand the chances of certain numbers being picked.

### Chronobiological Factors and Mathematical Probability Patterns

**Chronobiological factors**, like the time of day or week, can affect our choices. For instance, some might feel luckier on Fridays or Sundays. Mathematical patterns help us see the odds of certain numbers being chosen. By studying these patterns, we can make smarter choices when picking our numbers.

### Historical Winning Trends

Looking at past winning trends can also offer insights. By examining past numbers and trends, we can spot patterns. Some might play on days that have been lucky for them before. Others might choose days with higher winning odds based on math.

The science of **lucky days** and numbers is intricate. It combines chronobiological factors, mathematical patterns, and historical trends. By grasping these concepts, we can make better choices in the lottery and boost our chances of winning.

## Popular Days to Play the Lottery Worldwide

Many people ask if there are *popular days* to play the lottery and win. The answer changes based on the country and culture. In the *lottery worldwide* scene, some days are seen as luckier than others.

In some places, Fridays are thought to be lucky for playing the lottery. In others, Sundays are the best day. This shows how different cultures view luck in lottery play.

Looking closer at the *lottery worldwide*, the best days to play vary a lot. Some like to play on Mondays when the jackpot is smaller. Others wait for the weekends when the jackpot is bigger.

Statistics show winning big in lotteries like Mega Millions or Powerball is very rare. Yet, playing on *popular days* can add fun and excitement to trying your luck.

![](https://www.echatserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-2-1024x585.jpeg)

* The largest single jackpot in Canada was CAD $64 million in 2015 through Lotto 6/49.
* Oz Lotto paid out AUD $111,972,151 to four winners in 2012.

## Weekend vs. Weekday Lottery Strategies

Some folks believe playing the lottery on weekends is better. Others think weekdays are the way to go. But what do the *Saturday drawing statistics* really show? Let’s dive into the data to find out if there’s a best time to play.

Some gamblers think playing on certain days can boost their chances. For instance, Fridays after 6 p.m. are seen as lucky due to more people around. But, there’s no real proof for this. Casinos can’t change how games work just because it’s a certain day or time.

* Weekdays usually have fewer people trying to win, which might give you a better shot if you play then.
* Applying with a group of six in December or January can up your winning chances by up to 60%.
* The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are 1 in 292 million. The EuroJackpot has odds of 1 in 139.8 million.

| Lottery | Odds of Winning |
| --- | --- |
| Powerball | 1 in 292 million |
| EuroJackpot | 1 in 139.8 million |
| La Primitiva | 1 in 13.9 million |

Winning the lottery comes down to understanding the odds and making smart choices. By looking at the *Saturday drawing statistics* and other factors, players can craft a strategy. It doesn’t matter if it’s for weekends or weekdays.

## How Jackpot Sizes Influence Best Playing Days

Many things can affect the best days to play the lottery. One big factor is the jackpot size. Bigger jackpots draw more players, changing the odds of winning. For example, winning the Mega Millions jackpot is 1 in 175,711,536.

The size of the jackpot can also change how many people buy tickets. This means more competition and a chance for more winners. For instance, a $640 million jackpot had an expected value of just 46.3 cents per ticket because of multiple winners.

![](https://www.echatserver.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1-1024x585.jpeg)

Here are some key points to think about when looking at **jackpot sizes** and **best playing days**:

* Jackpot rollovers can make jackpots bigger, drawing more players and increasing competition.
* Buying tickets when the jackpot is smaller might give you a better chance of winning the whole thing because there’s less competition.
* Watching past winning numbers, jackpot amounts, and draw dates can help find patterns to guide your ticket buying.

| Jackpot Size | Number of Players | Expected Value of a Ticket |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $100 million | 100 million | $0.50 |
| $500 million | 500 million | $0.25 |
| $1 billion | 1 billion | $0.10 |

By thinking about these points and how **jackpot sizes** affect the **best playing days**, players can make smarter choices about their lottery strategy.

## The Impact of Seasonal Patterns on Lottery Wins

**Seasonal patterns** can greatly affect **lottery wins**. Different seasons and holidays change how people play. In the summer, people have more free time and play lottery games more, leading to bigger jackpots and more wins.

Research shows that some months and holidays see a big jump in lottery ticket sales. For example, the holiday season brings more ticket sales, which can mean more winners. Knowing these patterns helps players decide when and which games to play.

To boost their chances, players should play when it’s busiest. This means playing during peak seasons or using certain numbers. Here are some important stats:

* Lottery ticket sales go up during holidays and summer.
* Some numbers are drawn more often in certain seasons.
* Knowing **seasonal patterns** helps players make better choices.

By understanding how seasons affect **lottery wins**, players can improve their chances. Playing during busy times or using specific numbers can really help. Being aware of these patterns is key to winning big.

| Season | Lottery Ticket Sales | Winning Odds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Summer | Increased | Higher |
| Holiday Season | Surge | More Frequent Wins |

## Maximizing Your Odds Through Timing

Playing the lottery can be more successful with the right *timing*. Studies show that scratch-off tickets often have better odds than 1 in 5. This means a 20% chance of winning a prize. This fact shows how key *timing* is in making smart play choices.

To boost your chances, pick lotteries with better odds. Joining a syndicate or using system bets can also help. Playing every day can increase your winning chances. Also, look for games with many top prizes left, as they might offer better odds.

Knowing the value of *timing* and using these strategies can up your lottery win chances. Whether you’re new or experienced, *maximizing odds* through *timing* can greatly improve your lottery journey.

## Lesser-Known Factors Affecting Lottery Success

There are many factors that can affect your chances of winning the lottery. These include **economic influences** and regional variations. The state of the economy can change how many people play and how much they spend.

Also, different regions have their own lottery games and rules. This can change your chances of winning. Time zone differences can also affect when lottery draws happen.

### Economic Influences on Lottery Success

Economic conditions can greatly impact **lottery success**. During tough economic times, more people might play hoping to win big. But when the economy is strong, fewer people might play, feeling more financially secure.

### Regional Variations and Time Zone Considerations

Regional differences and time zones also matter. Some areas have better jackpot odds or more frequent draws. This can boost your winning chances. Draws happen at different times in different zones, too.

By understanding these factors, you can up your **lottery success** chances. It’s not just about picking numbers or playing on certain days. Knowing about **economic influences**, regional differences, and time zones can help too.

## Smart Strategies for Regular Players

Another strategy is to think about *subscription vs. single-play benefits*. Subscriptions make playing easy and hassle-free. Single-play options give more flexibility. Players should choose what works best for them.

*Group play timing* is also smart. It lets players join forces and buy more tickets. This can increase winning chances.

* Setting a budget and sticking to it
* Choosing games with better odds of winning
* Participating in lottery pools to enhance chances of winning
* Taking advantage of second-chance drawings for non-winning tickets

By using these strategies, **regular players** can improve their winning odds. They can also enjoy their lottery experience more.

Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.
