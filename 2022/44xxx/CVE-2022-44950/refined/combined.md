| Version: 3.2.1Description An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a Stored XSS vulnerability in "Name" field in the "Fields Configuration" feature. Proof of Concept**Step 1:** Go to "/index.php?module=entities/fields&entities\_id=24", click "Add New Field" and insert payload "`<img src=1 onerror='alert(document.cookie)'/>`" in "Name" field.[image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67278071/199525240-5ad76409-7e4e-4492-b3da-18ae31f607bc.png)**Step 2:** Alert XSS Message[image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67278071/199525276-e217a8a0-b40b-407f-9ef1-576d760ccc8f.png)Impact If an attacker can control a script that is executed in the victim's browser, then they can typically fully compromise that user. |
