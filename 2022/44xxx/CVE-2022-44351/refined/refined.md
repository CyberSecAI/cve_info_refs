Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The application is vulnerable to insecure deserialization. It uses the `unserialize` function on data controlled by the user through file uploads.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Insecure Deserialization:** The primary vulnerability is the use of `unserialize` on attacker-controlled data. This allows the attacker to craft a malicious serialized object that, upon deserialization, can execute arbitrary code.
    * **Unrestricted File Upload:**  The vulnerability is triggered via the file upload functionality in the admin panel. The lack of input sanitization on uploaded files allows the attacker to upload files containing the malicious serialized object.
    * **Direct Execution:** The exploitation directly leads to the creation of a webshell because the deserialization payload executes code which then allows the attacker to inject and execute PHP code.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution, potentially resulting in:
    * **Webshell Creation:** As demonstrated, an attacker can create a webshell on the server.
    * **Full System Compromise:**  With a webshell, the attacker can execute commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, and other malicious actions.

* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality, specifically at the URL `/admin/mystore/upload`.
    * **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a specific serialized PHP object containing malicious code.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * **Access to Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs access to the administrative panel and specifically, the file upload functionality at `/admin/mystore/upload`.
    * **Ability to Craft PHP Object:**  The attacker must know how to craft a malicious PHP serialized object that exploits the insecure deserialization and executes the code necessary to establish the webshell.
    * **Knowledge of vulnerable code:** The attacker must know the specific PHP code structure to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

* The provided content gives a sample of the malicious serialized object.
* The vulnerability was found in version 2.5.1 of the Skycaiji software.
* The provided screenshot confirms the successful creation of a web shell.
