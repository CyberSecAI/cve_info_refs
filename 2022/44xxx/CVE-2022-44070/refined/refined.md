The provided content describes a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zenario CMS version 9.3.57186.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization when handling user-provided content within the "Summary" and "Main content" fields of News articles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the database.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected news articles. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects a malicious SVG payload, specifically an `<EMBED>` tag containing an inline SVG with a `<script>` tag, into the "Summary" and "Main content" fields of a News article. When other users view that news article, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires an account with the privilege to create or edit News articles in the Zenario CMS. They need to be able to access the administrative panel. The attacker does not require access to other user accounts.
