The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Zenario CMS version 9.3.57186, which is a bypass of a previous fix for CVE-2021-41952.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insufficient sanitization of SVG files uploaded through the image upload functionality. Malicious SVG content is not properly sanitized, allowing for the execution of embedded JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied SVG file content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript code through the CMS image upload functionality.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to upload images. They need to craft an SVG file that contains malicious JavaScript code.
