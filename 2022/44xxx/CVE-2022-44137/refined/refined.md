Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-44137

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_inquiry` function within the Sanitization Management System. The application directly incorporates user-supplied input into a SQL query without validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The `id` parameter in the `/php-sms/?p=admin/inquiries/view_inquiry` URL is directly used in a SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing them to view, modify, or delete sensitive information. In this instance, the example provided shows the ability to leak the database name and user.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** SQL injection could lead to more severe attacks if the database user has sufficient privileges, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `/php-sms/?p=admin/inquiries/view_inquiry` endpoint.
*  **Injection point:** The `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover the vulnerable endpoint and the parameter to exploit.
* **No authentication required**: The exploit can be carried out without logging in. The vulnerable endpoint `/php-sms/?p=admin/inquiries/view_inquiry` can be accessed without authentication.

**Technical Details:**
The provided payload demonstrates how an attacker can inject a `UNION SELECT` statement into the SQL query through the `id` parameter to leak database information.
The vulnerable code is located at `/php-sms/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry`.

The example payload:
```
/php-sms/?p=admin/inquiries/view_inquiry&id=99999999999999999' union select 1,2,database(),user(),5,6,7,8,9 --+
```
This payload attempts to bypass normal query execution, and selects the database name and user, thus demonstrating that SQL injection is possible.
