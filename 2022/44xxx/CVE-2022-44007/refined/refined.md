Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-44007

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an unsafe implementation of session tracking within the BACKCLICK Professional application. Specifically, the PHP file management component reuses user information from the Java session. During the creation of a new PHP session, the application uses an arbitrary session identifier provided in the `ajxp_session` query parameter, rather than generating a secure, unpredictable session ID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Session Fixation:** The application is vulnerable to session fixation. An attacker can set a session ID via the `ajxp_session` parameter. When a legitimate user with an existing authenticated Java session clicks on a manipulated link, the application creates a new PHP session using the attacker-controlled session ID.
- **Unsafe Session ID Handling:** The vulnerability arises due to the application's failure to generate and enforce the use of secure session identifiers.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The application checks access restrictions only during login, not during session creation or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can gain access to the victim's account on the PHP file management application by using the fixed session ID.
- **Data Access & Manipulation:** Once authenticated as the victim user, the attacker can access and manipulate application data and files.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This session fixation vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities in the file management application (specifically, as described in SYSS-2022-027), ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a chosen session ID in the `ajxp_session` parameter. The victim, authenticated with a Java session, is tricked into visiting the URL. This can be embedded in a malicious website, potentially as an iframe.
- **External Web Interface:** The session fixation vulnerability can be exploited over the external web interface of BACKCLICK Professional, even if access restrictions are configured.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Attacker-Controlled Link:** The attacker needs to be able to present a manipulated URL to the target user.
- **Victim User with Valid Java Session:** The victim must already be logged into the Java-based management portion of the application when accessing the malicious link.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Application:** Knowledge of the vulnerable application endpoint and how the session is created is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the external access restrictions are bypassed once a session is fixed since these checks only occur during login.
- The session fixation vulnerability can be chained with a vulnerability in the file management component (SYSS-2022-027) to achieve arbitrary code execution.
