- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure usage of the "fopen" system function with the "wb" mode, allowing attackers to overwrite existing files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-band Filesystem Rewrite vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can overwrite system files, such as `/system.conf` and `/passwd`, potentially leading to privilege escalation by creating backdoor users with root privileges or changing the root password.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by the insecure usage of fopen with "wb" mode, however the exact method to reach this code is not described.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the insecure file overwrite functionality to exploit the vulnerability.
