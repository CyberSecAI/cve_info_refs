Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-44213

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when adding a new employee in the ZKT Eco ADMS software. Specifically, the "Emp Name" field does not filter out or encode special characters, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. The injected payload is stored in the database and executed every time the employee list is viewed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Account takeover
    - Stealing sensitive data
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the application
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the ZKT Eco ADMS application.
- The attacker needs to log in to the application (default admin/admin credentials are mentioned as an example).
- The attacker then navigates to the "Employee" management section and adds a new employee with the malicious payload in the "Emp Name" field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the ZKT Eco ADMS application.
- The attacker needs valid login credentials, although default credentials may be used for initial exploitation on vulnerable systems.
- The attacker must be able to navigate the application to the employee management section.

**Additional Notes:**
- The blog post mentions that the XSS vulnerability was fixed in versions after 3.1-164 of the ZKT Eco ADMS software.
- The provided steps and screenshots clearly show how to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The attacker used a non-malicious payload `<img src=a onerror=alert('stored-XSS');>` for demonstration purposes, but the vulnerability allows for the injection of more dangerous payloads.
