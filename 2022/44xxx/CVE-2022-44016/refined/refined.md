```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The API call \"GetImages\" allows setting the image path from the frontend, leading to arbitrary file access on the web server.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Local File Access: The API call \"GetImages\" allows an attacker to specify the image path, leading to the ability to download arbitrary files from the web server by manipulating this path. Specifically, by setting the base path to 'C:\\', all files can be accessed."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the web server, including potentially sensitive data, configurations, or source code. The files are returned base64 encoded, allowing the extraction of both text and binary data.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/DS/LM_API/api/ConfigurationService/GetImages` endpoint with a manipulated `ImagesPath` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is required due to the authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2022-44013), as long as a valid username is known (e.g. 'simmeth')."
