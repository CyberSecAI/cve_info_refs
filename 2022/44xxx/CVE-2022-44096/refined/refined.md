- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sanitization Management System has hardcoded credentials (username and an MD5 hashed password) in its source code, specifically within the database SQL file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Hardcoded credentials, specifically a default admin username and an MD5 hashed password. The use of MD5 hashing makes it easily crackable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain admin panel access by decrypting the MD5 hashed password and using the default credentials, allowing them to perform malicious activities within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to download the source code, access the database SQL file, extract the credentials, decrypt the password and use them to log into the admin panel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the source code and be able to identify the hardcoded credentials, and have knowledge of MD5 hashing. They also need to be able to use a tool to decrypt the MD5 hash.
