| Sanitization Management System — Use of Hard-coded Credentials in Source Code Leads to Admin Panel Access  Exploit Author: Upasana Bohra  Vendor Homepage: <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php-project>  Software Link: <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15770/sanitization-management-system-project-php-and-mysql-free-source-code.html>  Tested on Windows10  Linkedln Contact: <https://www.linkedin.com/in/upasana-bohra-8767b9156/>  Hardcoded Credentials:  Hardcoded Passwords, also often referred to as Embedded Credentials, are plain text passwords or other secrets in source code. Password hardcoding refers to the practice of embedding plain text (non-encrypted) passwords and other secrets (SSH Keys, DevOps secrets, etc.) into the source code. Default, hardcoded passwords may be used across many of the same devices, applications, systems, which helps simplify set up at scale, but at the same time, poses a considerable cybersecurity risk.  [Attack Vectors]  An attacker can gain admin panel access using default credentials and do malicious activities  Proof Of Concept  1 Download source code from <https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/15770/sanitization-management-system-project-php-and-mysql-free-source-code.html>  2 Now unzip it and go to the Database folder here we can see one SQL file.  3 Now open that file using Notepad and there we can see admin credentials. but the password is encrypted .from pattern I identified that this is MD5 hash. so we can easily decrypt using crackstation.net or any hash cracker tools like Hashcat, John the ripper. |
