The provided content relates to CVE-2022-44109.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `Stream::makeFilter` function within the `pdftojson` software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow in `Stream::makeFilter` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A stack overflow can lead to a crash of the application or potentially enable arbitrary code execution. In this case, the AddressSanitizer output shows the program crashing due to a stack overflow.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a maliciously crafted PDF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to provide a specially crafted PDF file to trigger the stack buffer overflow.
- The attacker can cause a denial of service by crashing the application. Potentially, it may lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue is triggered in function `Stream::makeFilter(char*, Stream*, Object*, int)` at `xpdf/Stream.cc:303:5`.
- The ASAN output shows a stack overflow error, specifically in `_IO_default_xsputn`, which suggests the overflow occurs when writing to a buffer on the stack.
- The provided PoC file `000009.zip` further confirms the ability to trigger the vulnerability with a crafted PDF file.
- The vulnerability exists within the `xpdf` library, which `pdftojson` uses for PDF processing.
