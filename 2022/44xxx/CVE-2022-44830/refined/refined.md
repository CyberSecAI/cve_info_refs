The content is related to CVE-2022-44830.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data before exporting it to a CSV file. Specifically, it does not neutralize or escape special characters used in spreadsheet formulas.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CSV Injection. The application is vulnerable to CSV injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization when exporting data to CSV.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution. When the exported CSV file is opened in a spreadsheet application (like Microsoft Excel), the malicious formulas are executed, potentially leading to code execution, data exfiltration or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**:
    -  An attacker injects malicious Excel formula into the First Name, Contact, and Remarks fields of the application.
    -  The application exports data to CSV format without sanitizing the fields.
    -  The victim downloads and opens the crafted CSV file in Excel.
    -  The spreadsheet application interprets and executes the injected formula as code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to input data into the vulnerable fields (First Name, Contact, Remarks) of the application. The attacker does not need access to the system where the file is opened, they just need to convince the user to open the malicious CSV.
