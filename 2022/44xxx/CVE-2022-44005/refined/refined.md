Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-44005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the use of consecutive, predictable IDs in verification links within the BACKCLICK Professional newsletter sign-up functionality. These IDs are base64-encoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authorization Bypass through User-Controlled Key (CWE-639):**  The core weakness is that the verification IDs used in newsletter subscription links are predictable, allowing an attacker to manipulate the 'c' parameter within the verification URL to access other users' data.
- **Information Disclosure:** Error messages reveal the email address of the subscriber linked to a particular ID when a manipulated verification link is used.
- **Privacy Issue:** The ability to enumerate subscriber email addresses poses a privacy risk.
- **Unconsented Subscriptions:**  Attackers can subscribe email addresses without the consent of the owners, as the verification ID is guessable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Enumeration of Subscriber Email Addresses:** Attackers can retrieve the email addresses of all newsletter subscribers.
- **Unauthorized Subscriptions:** Attackers can subscribe other peoples' email addresses to newsletters without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Manipulation:**  Attackers can craft and submit modified verification URLs by manipulating the base64-encoded ID (the `c` parameter) within the verification link.
- The attack can be carried out through the publicly accessible subscription form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No authentication required:** The attacker does not require any prior access to the system or any user account
- **Basic understanding of web requests:** The attacker only needs to understand the basic structure of URLs and how to modify query parameters.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable component is the newsletter sign-up functionality
- The affected product is BACKCLICK Professional 5.9.63 (On-Premises)
- The `tid` parameter appears to be a list ID, and the first number in the base64 decoded parameter `c`, appears to be an incrementing subscriber number.
