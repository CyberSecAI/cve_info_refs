{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `security_5g` parameter to the `param_5g` buffer without any size checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stack overflow vulnerability due to lack of bounds checking in strcpy."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The router crashes, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and gaining a root shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/goform/WifiBasicSet` with an overly long `security_5g` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. Requires knowledge of the router's IP address."
