Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization when deleting files, specifically within the `delete-resource` API endpoint. While a previous fix addressed path traversal during file uploads, this issue highlights that file deletion was still vulnerable to path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize the "name" parameter in the JSON payload of the delete request. This allows an attacker to specify file paths outside of the intended application's webroot.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  By exploiting the path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can delete any file on the server, accessible by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete any file on the server, potentially leading to data loss, application malfunction, or denial of service. This may also impact the integrity of the application and its functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/api/delete-resource` endpoint.
*   **Manipulated JSON Payload:** The request includes a JSON payload with a malicious file path provided in the "name" parameter. The attacker crafts this path using `../` sequences to navigate outside of the application's intended directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the application to send the malicious POST request.
*   **Understanding of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable `/api/delete-resource` endpoint and the structure of the JSON payload.
*   **No Authentication Required** The provided request doesn't show any authentication requirements.

**Additional details:**
*   The issue was fixed in pull request #1174 and the fix was released in version 1.126.1.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) shows how to delete a file named `test.txt` in the `/tmp` directory.
*   The vulnerable code used the `name` parameter directly when constructing the file path for deletion without proper validation.
