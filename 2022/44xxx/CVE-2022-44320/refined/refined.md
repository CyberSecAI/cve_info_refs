The provided content relates to CVE-2022-44320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Multiple heap buffer overflows exist in PicoC version 3.2.2 at various locations due to insufficient bounds checking and improper memory handling during operations such as string manipulation, type coercion, and output formatting.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The identified weaknesses include heap buffer overflows in the following functions and their respective call chains:
*   `StdioBasePrintf` in `cstdlib/stdio.c` when called from `ExpressionParseFunctionCall` in `expression.c`
*   `LexGetStringConstant` in `lex.c` when called from `LexScanGetToken` in `lex.c`
*   `ExpressionCoerceUnsignedInteger` in `expression.c` when called from `ExpressionParseFunctionCall` in `expression.c`
*   `ExpressionCoerceInteger` in `expression.c` when called from `ExpressionInfixOperator` in `expression.c`
*   `ExpressionAssign` in `expression.c` when called from `ExpressionParseMacroCall` in `expression.c`
*   `StringStrcat` in `cstdlib/string.c` when called from `ExpressionParseFunctionCall` in `expression.c`
*   `StringStrncpy` in `cstdlib/string.c` when called from `ExpressionParseFunctionCall` in `expression.c`
*   `ExpressionCoerceFP` in `expression.c` when called from `ExpressionParseFunctionCall` in `expression.c`
*   `StdioOutPutc` in `cstdlib/stdio.c` when called from `ExpressionParseFunctionCall` in `expression.c`
*   `LexSkipComment` in `lex.c` when called from `LexScanGetToken` in `lex.c`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these heap buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service (crashes), or other undefined behaviors due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the processing of specially crafted C code by the PicoC interpreter which triggers the vulnerable code paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to provide a malicious C script to the PicoC interpreter. No specific position is required. The attacker needs to be able to execute code through the PicoC interpreter.
