Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-44017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Errors in session management. Specifically, the encrypted password and username are not cleared from the local storage of the web browser upon logout.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The application fails to properly invalidate session data after a user logs out. The session data (username and encrypted password) persists in the browser's local storage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can regain access to a user's account after the user has logged out. By manually navigating to the main application URL (`https://<your-host>/LMS/LM/#main`), the attacker can bypass the logout state, as the stored credentials remain valid.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the local storage of a user's web browser. The attacker does not need to intercept network traffic or interact with the server in order to achieve the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have prior knowledge of a user that has logged into the application on the same device.
- The attacker needs to have access to the user's web browser and has to navigate to a specific url.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically that the frontend only changes its state, but does not clear the credentials, which remain in the browsers local storage, making it possible to force the frontend into a logged in state.
- The issue was fixed in version 5.6 of the Simmeth Supplier Manager.
