- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks due to improper input sanitization or encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks (AV:N), requiring low complexity (AC:L), and a user with low privileges (PR:L), user interaction (UI:R) is required. The scope of the attack is changed (S:C), with low impact on Confidentiality and Integrity (C:L/I:L) and no impact on Availability (A:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the application which is then executed by a victim's browser. A low privileged user is required for exploitation.
