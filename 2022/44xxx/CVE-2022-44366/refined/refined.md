The provided content details a heap overflow vulnerability in Tenda i21 router firmware, specifically version V1.0.0.14(4656). This aligns with the general format and intent of a CVE description although no CVE ID is specified in the content, the report is about a vulnerability, thus it is likely that this content is related to a CVE, but the actual CVE ID has to be checked against the content.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of size validation when using `strcpy` to copy data to the heap. Specifically, in the `/goform/setDiagnoseInfo` endpoint, a fixed size buffer of 0x50 bytes is allocated on the heap. Data following the `cmd=` parameter is copied into this buffer using `strcpy`. Since there is no bounds check, an attacker can send a string longer than 0x50 bytes, resulting in a heap overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap overflow. The use of `strcpy` without any bounds checking is the core weakness that makes this heap overflow possible.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows for a heap overflow, which can lead to a crash of the router. It is also possible that successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution. This is not explicity stated in the content, but the content implies that the router will crash.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setDiagnoseInfo` endpoint. The attacker includes a `cmd` parameter with a value longer than 0x50 bytes.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router on the LAN or WAN interface (depending on how the router is configured) and be able to craft the exploit. The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request with a specific content-type and cookie to the vulnerable endpoint.

The provided content also includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit in Python, demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability, resulting in a router crash. This gives more detail than a regular CVE description.
