- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input sanitization when handling user profile information. Specifically, the "First name" and "Last name" fields in user profiles do not properly sanitize input, allowing the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's profile. When another user views the profile or a page where the profile data is displayed, the malicious script will execute within their browser. This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unauthorized actions within the application context.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user profile update form. An attacker, authenticated with a user account, can input malicious JavaScript code into the "First name" or "Last name" profile fields. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account within the Zenario CMS and have the ability to edit their own user profile.
