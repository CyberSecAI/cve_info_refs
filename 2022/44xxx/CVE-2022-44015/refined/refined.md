Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-44015:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL Injection flaw in the Simmeth Supplier Manager application. The application allows an attacker to inject raw SQL queries via a subquery or stacked query within the table name parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing the injection of malicious SQL code. This allows execution of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the MSSQL server. This allows for full control over the database server and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Data Breach:** The attacker can read arbitrary data from the database, such as user password hashes, and potentially other sensitive information.
*   **File Access:** The attacker can leverage SQL queries to read arbitrary files from the file system of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted API request to the `/DS/LM_API/api/SelectionService/GetPaggedTab` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker only requires a valid username to send the malicious request. This is due to an authentication bypass vulnerability which allows the password parameter to be ignored in the request, meaning no valid password is required.
*   The attacker needs to know the target API endpoint and how to structure the malicious SQL query within the request.
