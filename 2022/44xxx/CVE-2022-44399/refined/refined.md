The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Poultry Farm Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user input in the `del` GET parameter of the `/Redcock-Farm/farm/category.php` file before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the unsanitized `del` parameter into an SQL query, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially manipulate the SQL queries to access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- The provided example demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection, which can be used to exfiltrate data.
- An attacker could potentially gain full control of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible via the HTTP GET method on the `/Redcock-Farm/farm/category.php` endpoint.
- The vulnerable parameter is `del`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement for exploiting this specific vulnerability.
