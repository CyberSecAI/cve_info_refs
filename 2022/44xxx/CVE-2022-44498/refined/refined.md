- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end or before the beginning of the intended buffer, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak. The CVSS score indicates a confidentiality impact of High (C:H), meaning there is a potential for sensitive information disclosure although the impact is categorized as a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning that the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs no privileges (PR:N), but user interaction is required (UI:R). The scope of the attack is unchanged (S:U), implying the vulnerability affects the application itself.
