The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Sanitization Management System v1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter within the `/php-sms/admin/?page=services/manage_service` URL, leading to SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, as well as gaining unauthorized access to the database. In this specific example, the attacker is able to extract the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the HTTP GET request to the `/php-sms/admin/?page=services/manage_service` endpoint, specifically via the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific authentication is needed to access the vulnerable page, but admin access will be required to use the vulnerable page. The attacker needs to inject SQL code into the `id` parameter to exploit the vulnerability.
