Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-44730:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper configuration of the Rhino JavaScript engine whitelist within Apache Batik. Specifically, the whitelist was not empty as intended, and contained entries that allowed access to sensitive Java classes.
- The intended fix was to switch to an empty whitelist, but an intermediate commit did not do that.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- The ability to probe user profiles/data and send them directly as parameters to a URL.
- Information Disclosure via the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could cause the underlying server to make arbitrary GET requests.
-  Attackers can load arbitrary URLs through the jar protocol and fetch external resources.
- Attackers can access files using a Jar URL.
- Malicious SVGs can trigger the loading of external resources, leading to resource consumption or information disclosure.
- Attackers can probe user profile/data and send them as a parameter to a URL.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Maliciously crafted SVG files.
-  Specially crafted arguments used by the NodePickerPanel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a malicious SVG file for processing by Apache Batik.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "medium" severity.
-  Affected versions are Batik 1.0 to 1.16.
-  The fix is to upgrade to Batik 1.17
- The issue was independently reported by Julien Lacour.
- Several other SSRF vulnerabilities were reported in Apache Batik, as seen in the Debian LTS advisory and the Apache XML Graphics Security page.
