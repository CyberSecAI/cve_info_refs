Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2022-44553:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the HiView module's failure to filter out third-party applications when traversing to invoke the system provider. This lack of filtering allows unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation/Filtering:** The HiView module lacks proper filtering of third-party apps during system provider invocation. This means that the module does not properly check if a calling app is authorized to interact with the system provider.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Periodic Third-Party App Activation:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to third-party applications being activated periodically. This could manifest as unwanted app launches or background processes being triggered by an attacker-controlled app.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves a third-party application exploiting the HiView module. This means that a malicious or compromised app would need to be installed on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to install a malicious application:** An attacker would need to have the ability to install a crafted application on the affected Huawei device.

**Affected Versions:**
- EMUI 12.0.1
- EMUI 12.0.0
- EMUI 11.0.1
