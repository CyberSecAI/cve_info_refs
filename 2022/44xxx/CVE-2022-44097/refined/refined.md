- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hard-coded credentials (username and a MD5 hashed password) are present in the database SQL file of the Book Store Management System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Hard-coded credentials within source code. The password, while hashed with MD5, is easily crackable using online tools or hash cracking software, exposing the system to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain admin panel access using the recovered credentials. This allows them to perform malicious activities, which could include data theft, system modification, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by downloading the source code of the Book Store Management System and examining the database SQL file for the credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to download the source code and have the ability to perform a hash cracking.
