**CVE-2022-44749 - Opening workflows in KNIME Analytics Platform from untrusted sources may override arbitrary file system contents**

*   **Root Cause:** A directory traversal vulnerability exists in the ZIP archive extraction routines of KNIME Analytics Platform. This is also known as a 'Zip-Slip' vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability lies in the way KNIME Analytics Platform handles ZIP archives when opening workflow files. It doesn't properly sanitize the paths within the ZIP archive, allowing for directory traversal.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious KNIME workflow that, when opened, overwrites arbitrary files on the user's file system.
    *   This can lead to data integrity issues (file content changes) or cause errors in other software (vital files being corrupted).
    *   In severe cases, it could lead to remote code execution if executable files are replaced and subsequently run by the user.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    * The primary attack vector is a specially crafted KNIME workflow file.
    * The user must open this workflow file using KNIME Analytics Platform for the exploit to occur.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to create a malicious KNIME workflow file.
    *   The attacker needs to entice the victim to open the malicious workflow file.
    *   The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the system.
    *   The user needs write access to the files that are targeted to be overwritten.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered when the workflow file is opened, it's not required to execute it.
    *   An error is reported, but only after the files have been overwritten, this is a potential indicator for the user.
