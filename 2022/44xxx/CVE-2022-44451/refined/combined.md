# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1669

## Open Babel MSI format atom uninitialized pointer dereference vulnerability

##### July 21, 2023

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-44451

##### SUMMARY

A use of uninitialized pointer vulnerability exists in the MSI format atom functionality of Open Babel 3.1.1 and master commit 530dbfa3. A specially crafted malformed file can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.

##### CONFIRMED VULNERABLE VERSIONS

The versions below were either tested or verified to be vulnerable by Talos or confirmed to be vulnerable by the vendor.

Open Babel 3.1.1

Open Babel master commit 530dbfa3

##### PRODUCT URLS

Open Babel - <https://openbabel.org/>

##### CVSSv3 SCORE

9.8 - CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

##### CWE

CWE-824 - Access of Uninitialized Pointer

##### DETAILS

Open Babel is a popular library for converting chemical file formats, currently supporting about 130 different file formats. It implements bindings for several programming languages. Because of the nature of the library, and since there are many online chemical format converters and molecule viewers which might be using Open Babel in their backend for parsing and conversion, we consider this software as potentially accessible via network.

Open Babel ships a simple converter application called `obabel` that can be used to trigger the issue described in this advisory. `obabel` supports `-i` and `-o` parameters, which select the input and output formats to perform the conversion. `obabel` supports multiple input and output files (as does the Open Babel library itself): this technically allows multiple vulnerabilities to trigger in sequence, which in turn could make some vulnerabilities easier to exploit. In this advisory, however, we focus on only one input file and a corresponding output file.

When a single input file and output file are supplied, `obabel.cpp` records the input and output formats (if supplied) and calls `OBConversion::FullConvert` in `obconversion.cpp`. Inside this function, there’s a call to `OpenAndSetFormat`, which uses `FormatFromExt` to derive the input format from the filename extension if no `-i` parameter was supplied. Similarly, `OpenInAndOutFiles` can be used to derive both input and output formats from the filename extensions when none are supplied.

Depending on how the `obabel` application is invoked, different paths could actually take place. Eventually, `pInFormat` and `pOutFormat` (of base class `OBFormat`) objects are allocated, which are instances of the classes that implement the selected input and output formats.

The code then proceeds with a call to `OBConversion::Convert`, which eventually leads to calling `pInFormat->ReadMolecule` and `pOutFormat->WriteMolecule`.

In this advisory, we describe an issue in the `msi` file format (`formats/msiformat.cpp`) when parsing an input file via `ReadMolecule`.

```
      bool MSIFormat::ReadMolecule(OBBase* pOb, OBConversion* pConv)
      {
        ...
        unsigned int startBondAtom, endBondAtom, bondOrder;
        bool atomRecord = false;
        bool bondRecord = false;
[1]     OBAtom *atom;
        ...

[2]     while (ifs.getline(buffer,BUFF_SIZE))
          {
            ...

            // atom record
[3]         if (!bondRecord && strstr(buffer, "Atom") != nullptr) {
              atomRecord = true;
              openParens++;
              continue;
            }
            ...

            // atom information
[4]         if (atomRecord) {
[5]           if (strstr(buffer, "ACL") != nullptr) {
                tokenize(vs, buffer);
                // size should be 5 -- need a test here
                if (vs.size() != 5) return false; // timvdm 18/06/2008
                vs[3].erase(0,1); // "6 => remove the first " character
                unsigned int atomicNum = atoi(vs[3].c_str());
                if (atomicNum == 0)
                  atomicNum = 1; // hydrogen ?

                // valid element, so create the atom
[6]             atom = mol.NewAtom();
                atom->SetAtomicNum(atomicNum);
                continue;
              }
[7]           else if (strstr(buffer, "XYZ") != nullptr) {
                tokenize(vs, buffer);
                // size should be 6 -- need a test here
                if (vs.size() != 6) return false; // timvdm 18/06/2008
                vs[3].erase(0,1); // remove ( character
                vs[5].erase(vs[5].length()-2, 2); // remove trailing )) characters
[8]             atom->SetVector(atof(vs[3].c_str()),
                                atof(vs[4].c_str()),
                                atof(vs[5].c_str()));
                continue;
              }
            } // end of atom records

```

At [1], an `atom` pointer is declared but not initialized. Then the code starts to scan each line in the file [2]. If a line containing “Atom” is found, `atomRecord` is set to true. This allows the condition to be entered at [4] on the next line read. If the line also contains “ACL”, a new atom is instantiated and the `atom` pointer gets initialized [6]. However, if the line contains “XYZ” [7], `atom` is dereferenced without checking if it has ever been initialized [8]. For example, it’s possible to supply a file containing only “XYZ” lines. This will allow multiple arbitrary writes to execute with controlled values, since all parameters to `SetVector` are under attacker control.

```
    void OBAtom::SetVector(const double v_x,const double v_y,const double v_z)
    {
      if (!_c)
        _v.Set(v_x,v_y,v_z);
      else
        {
          (*_c)[_cidx  ] = v_x;
          (*_c)[_cidx+1] = v_y;
          (*_c)[_cidx+2] = v_z;
        }
    }

```

Because `_c` and `_cidx` are referenced as an offset from the uninitialized `atom` pointer and parameters are arbitrary, `SetVector` provides a powerful exploitation primitive. The `atom` pointer is stored on the stack, and, depending on how the code is compiled and the stack is laid out, the pointer could be under full control of an attacker, who could in turn use this to execute arbitrary code.

                unsigned int atomicNum = atoi(vs[3].c_str());
                if (atomicNum == 0)
                  atomicNum = 1; // hydrogen ?

                // valid element, so create the atom
[6]             atom = mol.NewAtom();
                atom->SetAtomicNum(atomicNum);
                continue;
              }
[7]           else if (strstr(buffer, "XYZ") != nullptr) {
                tokenize(vs, buffer);
                // size should be 6 -- need a test here
                if (vs.size() != 6) return false; // timvdm 18/06/2008
                vs[3].erase(0,1); // remove ( character
                vs[5].erase(vs[5].length()-2, 2); // remove trailing )) characters
[8]             atom->SetVector(atof(vs[3].c_str()),
                                atof(vs[4].c_str()),
                                atof(vs[5].c_str()));
                continue;

At [1], an `atom` pointer is declared but not initialized. Then the code starts to scan each line in the file [2]. If a line containing “Atom” is found, `atomRecord` is set to true. This allows the condition to be entered at [4] on the next line read. If the line also contains “ACL”, a new atom is instantiated and the `atom` pointer gets initialized [6]. However, if the line contains “XYZ” [7], `atom` is dereferenced without checking if it has ever been initialized [8]. For example, it’s possible to supply a file containing only “XYZ” lines. This will allow multiple arbitrary writes to execute with controlled values, since all parameters to `SetVector` are under attacker control.

```
    void OBAtom::SetVector(const double v_x,const double v_y,const double v_z)
    {
      if (!_c)
        _v.Set(v_x,v_y,v_z);
      else
        {
          (*_c)[_cidx  ] = v_x;
          (*_c)[_cidx+1] = v_y;
          (*_c)[_cidx+2] = v_z;
        }
    }

```

Because `_c` and `_cidx` are referenced as an offset from the uninitialized `atom` pointer and parameters are arbitrary, `SetVector` provides a powerful exploitation primitive. The `atom` pointer is stored on the stack, and, depending on how the code is compiled and the stack is laid out, the pointer could be under full control of an attacker, who could in turn use this to execute arbitrary code.
