Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-44870:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflective XSS vulnerability found in the maccms10 application.
- It occurs when user-supplied data is not properly sanitized before being displayed on a web page. Specifically, user-controlled input injected into the "Name" field under "Basics > AD Management" is reflected back in the `infocat.html` page without being encoded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Theft of sensitive user data

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the "Name" field under "Basics > AD Management". This input is then reflected in the `infocat.html` page, causing the browser to execute the injected script when a user visits the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel to modify the "Name" field under "Basics > AD Management".
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user of the admin panel.
- The attacker must know the vulnerable URL  `http://127.0.0.1/admin.php/admin/banner/infocat.html`

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as a medium risk.
- Affected versions: `v2021.1000.1081 <= version <= v2022.1000.3032`
