The provided content details multiple heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities in PicoC version 3.2.2.

**Root Cause:** The root cause for all vulnerabilities is insufficient bounds checking when handling string or memory operations in various functions across `cstdlib/stdio.c`, `lex.c`, and `expression.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - Multiple Heap Buffer Overflows: Specifically, 10 unique heap buffer overflows were identified.
   - Vulnerable Functions: The vulnerabilities are located in the following functions:
        - `StdioBasePrintf` in `cstdlib/stdio.c`
        - `LexGetStringConstant` in `lex.c`
        - `ExpressionCoerceUnsignedInteger` in `expression.c`
        - `ExpressionCoerceInteger` in `expression.c`
        - `ExpressionAssign` in `expression.c`
        - `StringStrcat` in `cstdlib/string.c`
        - `StringStrncpy` in `cstdlib/string.c`
        - `ExpressionCoerceFP` in `expression.c`
        - `StdioOutPutc` in `cstdlib/stdio.c`
        - `LexSkipComment` in `lex.c`

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Arbitrary Code Execution: By exploiting these heap overflows, an attacker could potentially overwrite heap metadata and achieve arbitrary code execution.
   - Denial of Service: Exploiting these vulnerabilities could also cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
   - Malicious C Code: The primary attack vector is through the use of a specially crafted C file that, when interpreted by PicoC, triggers the heap overflows during the parsing or execution phase.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - Ability to provide input to PicoC: An attacker must have the ability to provide a malicious C script to the PicoC interpreter.
   - No specific privilege is explicitly mentioned, but the ability to execute the interpreter on a system is assumed.

**Technical Details:**
   - Each vulnerability is associated with a specific call stack showing how the vulnerable function is reached, along with address sanitizer (ASAN) outputs detailing the exact location and type of memory corruption.
   - The ASAN output includes the allocation history for the corrupted memory, allowing for precise tracking of the root cause and affected regions.

**Additional Notes:**
   - The provided ASAN logs include shadow bytes, helping pinpoint the exact byte(s) that trigger the heap buffer overflow.
   - Reproduction files are provided, each triggering a unique overflow.
   - The report highlights multiple distinct buffer overflows, indicating a pattern of insecure memory handling within the PicoC codebase.
