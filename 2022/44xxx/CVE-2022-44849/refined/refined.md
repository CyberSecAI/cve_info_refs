The provided content is related to CVE-2022-44849.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in MetInfo version 7.7.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to add a super administrator to the application. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a CSRF attack, by crafting a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, adds a super administrator account. This can be done via a link or a website that the victim user visits while being authenticated on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have knowledge of how to add an administrator via an HTTP request.
- The attacker must trick an authenticated user into executing the malicious request. This can be accomplished via social engineering.
- An attacker does not need to have prior access to the application or the server, but must know how to exploit the functionality that adds new administrators.
