Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `view_service.php` file within the Automotive Shop Management System. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in an SQL query without adequate escaping or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameter, allowing them to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use SQL injection techniques to extract sensitive data from the database, such as database names, table structures, and user credentials. The provided payload demonstrates extracting the database name.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:** Beyond information disclosure, successful exploitation could allow an attacker to modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues or service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `view_service.php` endpoint, with the malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can directly manipulate the URL by injecting SQL code into the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft suitable payloads for data extraction or manipulation.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File:** `/asms/admin/services/view_service.php`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
*   **Payload Example:** `/asms/admin/services/view_service.php?id=2' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
*   The payload exploits the `updatexml` function to extract the database name.
*   The comment syntax `--+` is used to nullify remaining SQL statements that may cause errors.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided content includes login credentials "admin/admin123," which further increases the risk to the system.
