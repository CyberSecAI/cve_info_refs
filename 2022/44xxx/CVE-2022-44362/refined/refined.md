Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `/goform/AddSysLogRule` endpoint of the Tenda i21 router's firmware. Specifically, the `logip`, `logport`, and `len` parameters are concatenated into `mib_value` using `sprintf` without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack overflow:** The lack of size validation on the `logip`, `logport`, and `len` parameters when they are concatenated using `sprintf` allows an attacker to provide overly large input. This overwrites the stack, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Router Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash of the router.
- **Remote Code Execution (Possible):** The document states that a stack overflow is present and that it's possible to write an exploit to gain a root shell. While an exploit isn't provided, the nature of the stack overflow vulnerability allows for this possibility.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted POST request to `/goform/AddSysLogRule`. The request should contain `op=add` along with a large `logip`, `logport`, or `len`. The provided proof-of-concept focuses on a large `logip` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device, as the exploit is performed over HTTP.
- **Knowledge of the Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific endpoint `/goform/AddSysLogRule` and the required POST parameters (`op`, `logip`, `logport`, `len`).

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how to trigger the stack overflow using Python.
- The content specifies that the firmware version `Tenda i21 V1.0.0.14(4656)` is vulnerable.
- The document claims that a root shell can be obtained but does not go into details of exploitation.
