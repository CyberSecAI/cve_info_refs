[图片2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198816384-f76ee49d-6d3b-4fec-bf08-84d4fc218268.png) 2、Construct the JS script at the record number. [图片3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198816435-293df216-7c2a-4538-a113-e2607ac4d7d9.png) 3、Open the EyouCMS client.

[图片5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83074322/198816477-b262a20d-155f-4d4d-b089-861b244d1fd1.png) 5、Open the EyouCMS client.

| 已修复部分，有些输入框是需要填写js代码，比如：网站第三方统计代码，这里不能过滤掉js代码，还有些用户在版权输入框填写代码统计代码，各种神奇的操作都有。 |
