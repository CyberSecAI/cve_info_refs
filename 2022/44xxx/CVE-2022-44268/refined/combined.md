Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2023-93389b8a9e
2023-02-22 11:06:32.700085
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : ImageMagick
Product : Fedora 36
Version : 6.9.12.77
Release : 1.fc36
URL : <https://legacy.imagemagick.org/>
Summary : An X application for displaying and manipulating images
Description :
ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X
Window System. ImageMagick can read and write JPEG, TIFF, PNM, GIF,
and Photo CD image formats. It can resize, rotate, sharpen, color
reduce, or add special effects to an image, and when finished you can
either save the completed work in the original format or a different
one. ImageMagick also includes command line programs for creating
animated or transparent .gifs, creating composite images, creating
thumbnail images, and more.

ImageMagick is one of your choices if you need a program to manipulate
and display images. If you want to develop your own applications
which use ImageMagick code or APIs, you need to install
ImageMagick-devel as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : ImageMagick
Product : Fedora 37
Version : 6.9.12.77
Release : 1.fc37
URL : <https://legacy.imagemagick.org/>
Summary : An X application for displaying and manipulating images
Description :
ImageMagick is an image display and manipulation tool for the X
Window System. ImageMagick can read and write JPEG, TIFF, PNM, GIF,
and Photo CD image formats. It can resize, rotate, sharpen, color
reduce, or add special effects to an image, and when finished you can
either save the completed work in the original format or a different
one. ImageMagick also includes command line programs for creating
animated or transparent .gifs, creating composite images, creating
thumbnail images, and more.

ImageMagick is one of your choices if you need a program to manipulate
and display images. If you want to develop your own applications
which use ImageMagick code or APIs, you need to install
ImageMagick-devel as well.

# ImageMagick: The hidden vulnerability behind your online images

February, 1, 2023

5 minutes read

**By Bryan Gonzalez from **Ocelot** Team**
## Introduction

[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) is a free and open-source software suite for displaying, converting, and editing image files. It can read and write over 200 image file formats and, therefore, is very common to find it in websites worldwide since there is always a need to process pictures for users’ profiles, catalogs, etc.

In a recent [APT Simulation](https://www.metabaseq.com/measure/#zero-apt/) engagement, the Ocelot team identified that ImageMagick was used to process images in a [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/about)-based website, and hence, the team decided to try to find new vulnerabilities in this component, proceeding to download the latest version of ImageMagick, 7.1.0-49 at that time. As a result, two zero days were identified:

* CVE-2022-44267: ImageMagick 7.1.0-49 is vulnerable to Denial of Service. When it parses a PNG image (e.g., for resize), the convert process could be left waiting for stdin input.
* CVE-2022-44268: ImageMagick 7.1.0-49 is vulnerable to Information Disclosure. When it parses a PNG image (e.g., for resize), the resulting image could have embedded the content of an arbitrary remote file (if the ImageMagick binary has permissions to read it).

### How to trigger the exploitation?

An attacker needs to upload a malicious image to a website using ImageMagick, in order to exploit the above mentioned vulnerabilities remotely.

The Ocelot team is very grateful for the team of volunteers of ImageMagick, who validated and released the patches needed in a timely manner:

<https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/05673e63c919e61ffa1107804d1138c46547a475>

In this blog, the technical details of the vulnerabilities are explained.

## CVE-2022-44267: Denial of service

### ImageMagick: 7.1.0-49

When ImageMagick parses a PNG file, for example in a resize operation when receiving an image, the convert process could be left waiting for stdin input leading to a Denial of Service since the process won’t be able to process other images.

A malicious actor could craft a PNG or use an existing one and add a textual chunk type (e.g., tEXt). These types have a keyword and a text string. If the keyword is the string “profile” (without quotes) then ImageMagick will interpret the text string as a filename and will load the content as a raw profile. If the specified filename is “-“ (a single dash) ImageMagick will try to read the content from standard input potentially leaving the process waiting forever.

Exploitation Path Execution:

* Upload image to trigger ImageMagick command, like “convert”
* ReadOnePNGImage (coders/png.c:2164)

## CVE-2022-44268: Arbitrary Remote Leak

### ImageMagick: 7.1.0-49

When ImageMagick parses the PNG file, for example in a resize operation, the resulting image could have embedded the content of an arbitrary remote file from the website (if magick binary has permissions to read it).

A malicious actor could craft a PNG or use an existing one and add a textual chunk type (e.g., tEXt). These types have a keyword and a text string. If the keyword is the string “profile” (without quotes) then ImageMagick will interpret the text string as a filename and will load the content as a raw profile, then the attacker can download the resized image which will come with the content of a remote file.

Exploitation Path Execution:

* Upload image to trigger ImageMagick command, like “convert”
* ReadOnePNGImage (coders/png.c:2164):

![](https://www.metabaseq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/imageMagick-12.png)

– Reading tEXt chunk:

* Checking if keyword equals to “profile”:

![](https://www.metabaseq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/imageMagick-15.png)

* Copying the text string as filename in line 4720 and saving the content in line 4722:

![](https://www.metabaseq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/imageMagick-16.png)

* FileToStringInfo to store the content into string\_info->datum, (MagickCore/string.c:1005):

![](https://www.metabaseq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/imageMagick-17.png)

* If a valid (and accessible) filename is provided, the content will be returned to the caller function (FileToStringInfo) and the StringInfo object will return to the SetImageProperty function, saving the blob into the new image generated, thanks to the function SetImageProfile:

![](https://www.metabaseq.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/imageMagick-18.png)

This new image will be available to download by the attackers with the arbitrary website file content embedded inside.

PoC: Malicious PNG content to leak “/etc/passwd” file:

89504E470D0A1A0A0000000D4948445200000001000000010100000000376EF9240000000A49444154789C636800000082008177CD72B6000000147445587470726F66696C65002F6574632F70617373776400B7F46D9C0000000049454E44AE426082

[# Mastering Digital Image Alchemy](/script/../)

[![And Now a Touch of Magick](/script/../image/wizard.jpg)](/script/../image/wizard.png "And Now a Touch of Magick") ImageMagick[®](http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78333969) is a free, [open-source](https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php) software suite, used for editing and manipulating digital images. It can be used to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images, and supports a wide range of file [formats](/script/../script/formats.php), including JPEG, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and Ultra HDR.

ImageMagick is widely used in industries such as web development, graphic design, and video editing, as well as in scientific research, medical imaging, and astronomy. Its versatile and customizable nature, along with its robust image processing capabilities, make it a popular choice for a wide range of image-related tasks.

ImageMagick includes a command-line interface for executing complex image processing tasks, as well as APIs for integrating its features into software applications. It is written in C and can be used on a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.

The main website for ImageMagick can be found at <https://imagemagick.org>. The most recent version available is [ImageMagick 7.1.1-43](/script/../script/download.php). The source code for this software can be accessed through a [repository](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick). In addition, we maintain a legacy version of ImageMagick, [version 6](https://legacy.imagemagick.org).

Creating a security policy that fits your specific local environment before making use of ImageMagick is highly advised. You can find guidance on setting up this [policy](/script/../script/security-policy.php). Also, it's important to verify your policy using the [validation tool](https://imagemagick-secevaluator.doyensec.com/).

### Features and Capabilities

One of the key features of ImageMagick is its support for scripting and automation. This allows users to create complex image manipulation pipelines that can be run automatically, without the need for manual intervention. This can be especially useful for tasks that require the processing of large numbers of images, or for tasks that need to be performed on a regular basis.

In addition to its core image manipulation capabilities, ImageMagick also includes a number of other features, such as support for animation, color management, and image rendering. These features make it a versatile tool for a wide range of image-related tasks, including graphic design, scientific visualization, and digital art.
