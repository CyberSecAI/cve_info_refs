{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The EyouCMS v1.5.9 application does not properly validate requests to modify member profiles, specifically within the backend member center's edit member profile function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can modify a user's profile details, including changing the user's password and membership level, without the user's consent. This can lead to unauthorized access and potential account compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML file that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, triggers a request to the vulnerable endpoint in the EyouCMS application.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to get a logged-in administrator to open a malicious HTML file."
