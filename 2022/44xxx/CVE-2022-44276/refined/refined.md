The provided content is a Proof of Concept (PoC) for CVE-2022-44276, detailing how to bypass upload restrictions in Responsive Filemanager versions prior to 9.12.0, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization and validation of uploaded file names, combined with a weakness in the file type detection mechanism.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Filename sanitization bypass:** The `strip_tags` function removes brackets from file names, allowing an attacker to upload a file named `shell.php<.txt` which becomes `shell.php` after processing.
2. **Content-based file type check bypass:** The `get_extension_from_mime` function determines the file type based on the first few bytes of the file content. This allows an attacker to prepend the payload with 'a' characters, fooling the function to detect the file as a text file while retaining the executable php code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file to the server. By accessing this file through a crafted URL, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of Responsive Filemanager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. The attacker needs to be able to access the file upload functionality of the Responsive Filemanager.
2. The attacker needs to be able to intercept the upload request, and modify the filename.
3. The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that includes the 'a' prefix, and the php code.
