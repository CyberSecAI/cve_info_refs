- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Mendix SAML module does not sufficiently protect against packet capture replay.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Insufficient protection against packet capture replay, leading to an authentication bypass. This vulnerability is present when the non-default configuration option "Allow Idp Initiated Authentication" is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized remote attackers can bypass authentication and gain access to the application.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks, specifically by capturing and replaying network packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be able to capture network packets and replay them. This implies the attacker needs to be in a position to observe network traffic, and needs to have the ability to replay captured packets.
