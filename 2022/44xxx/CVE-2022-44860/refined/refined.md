{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter of the `/asms/admin/transactions/update_status.php` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability exists due to lack of proper input validation and sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive database information, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/asms/admin/transactions/update_status.php` file with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is explicitly required for this specific endpoint to be vulnerable as the page is accessible directly."
