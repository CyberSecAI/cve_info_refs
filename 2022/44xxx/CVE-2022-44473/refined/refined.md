- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple instances of XSS vulnerabilities are present.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L) and requires a low privilege user (PR:L) and user interaction (UI:R). The scope is either changed (S:C) or unchanged(S:U). 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the application, which requires a user with low privileges to interact with the injected content.
