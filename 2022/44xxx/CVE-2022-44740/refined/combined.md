Turn your WooCommerce store and your WordPress site into efficient marketing engines. All ecommerce contacts and form entries are all captured in our included CRM and synced automatically with Creative Mail.

* **Enhanced Ecommerce:** WooCommerce store customers and ecommerce interactions are all captured automatically within your email marketing list. Retarget and re-engage your customers. Sell more stuff.
* **Beautiful Transactional Emails:** Standard WooCommerce triggered emails can be replaced to match your branding and style. Build one, and then all your other WooCommerce emails managed by Creative will inherit the same branded look. Hey, style matters.

* **Build Better Branding:** Creative Mail includes our free LogoBuilder and image editing suite to enhance your brand.
* **Amazing Stock Images:** You get free access to the completely integrated photo library (in addition to your own WordPress media library) to make amazing email marketing campaigns with award-winning images.

As a result, your emails can get bounced or never delivered. Creative Mail is an all-in-one solution that uses a rock solid infrastructure, for superior deliverability. Boom! ‘nuff said.
* **Live Support:** With our paid plans (Awesome & Ultimate) you get access to phone and chat support to help you get answers from real live, helpful humans. Imagine that!

Welcome your customers with email automation.

### [ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS](https://www.creativemail.com):

No matter how many times you try, it seems impossible to cancel your plan. Legal steps are necessary unfortunately.

I hate that this buggy plugin is being pushed to us by wordpress or hostinger. For those of you considering this, don’t be lazy and get a MailChimp or GetResponse.
When you buy a plan, it has a 24-48 hour window to approve it. Sometimes when you’re at a pinch, this can be a long frustrating window. My plugin didn’t work after 3 days and it drove me nuts.
They only have email customer support. Unlike GetResponse, which has 24/7 live chat, these guys took a week to respond to my request to cancel and said because I renewed my plan I can’t get a refund. Um… This was my first time purchasing a plan, and I wanted a refund just three days in.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
