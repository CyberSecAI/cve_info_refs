Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-44543:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a broken access control issue in the "femanager" TYPO3 extension. Specifically, the `usergroup.inList` validation can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Broken Access Control: The core issue is the ability to circumvent the intended access control mechanisms related to user group assignments during registration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to create new frontend users and assign them to restricted user groups, which they would not normally have access to. This could lead to unauthorized access to resources or functionalities intended for specific user groups.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the registration form of the "femanager" extension. If the `usergroup` field is exposed in the registration form, an attacker can manipulate the input to bypass the access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the registration form where the "femanager" extension is used. No special privileges are required for the attack; it can be performed by an unauthenticated user.
