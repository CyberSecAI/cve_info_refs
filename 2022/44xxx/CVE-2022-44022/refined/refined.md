{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application's login mechanism exhibits a timing difference between successful and failed authentication attempts, allowing an attacker to discern valid usernames by analyzing response times.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-287",
      "CWE-307"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can identify valid user account names, which can be used for further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attack via HTTP login POST requests.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's login endpoint and measure response times. No specific privileges or user interaction is required."
  },
  "additional_info": {
     "exploitation_steps": "An attacker sends login requests with various usernames. By observing the response time to the login request, valid usernames can be identified since they cause a longer response time compared to invalid ones. This can be achieved by using a brute-force dictionary attack.",
     "remediation": "The suggested remediation is to add a timing delay to balance the response timing for each login request.",
    "affected_versions": "PwnDoc through 0.5.3",
     "fix_commit": "Fixed in commit bd8bded"
