Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-44149

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `goform/sysTools` component of the Nexxt Amp300 ARN02304U8 router's web service. Specifically, the `host` parameter within the JSON payload of the ping feature is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **OS Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands by manipulating the `host` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The router's firmware fails to properly sanitize or validate the input provided in the `host` field, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected router.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control over the router, allowing the attacker to perform malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, network manipulation, or using the router as a botnet node.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/sysTools` endpoint.
- **JSON Payload Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the JSON payload, specifically injecting a command within the `host` parameter of the ping feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the router's web interface.
- **Authentication:** The attacker must possess valid credentials to authenticate to the router's web interface before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/sysTools` with parameters including `tool=0`, `pingCount=4`, and a malicious command within the `host` parameter, such as `host= &telnetd`.
-  The provided exploit code demonstrates the use of `&telnetd` to enable telnet access to the router as part of the command injection payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Nexxt Amp300 ARN02304U8 devices running firmware version 42.103.1.5095.
