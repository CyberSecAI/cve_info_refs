- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The All In One WP Security & Firewall plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.
- **Attack vectors:** By tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, an attacker can send forged requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a higher privileged, authenticated user into initiating an action. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to initiate the exploit.
