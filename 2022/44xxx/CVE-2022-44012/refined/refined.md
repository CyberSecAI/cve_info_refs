The provided content is related to CVE-2022-44012.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the database, specifically within the "Bemerkung" field of the "Lieferzeiten" table.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a victim when the vulnerable page is loaded.
- The attacker can steal the victim's encrypted password stored in the browser's local storage, and potentially decrypt it.
- The attacker can potentially gain full control of the user's session and account.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a specially crafted API request to insert malicious JavaScript into the database.
- The victim visits a page displaying the stored data, which triggers the execution of the attacker's JavaScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid username (the password is not required due to an authentication bypass vulnerability also present in the application) to send the malicious request.
- The attacker must have access to the application's API endpoint.
