The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting the "Appalti & Contratti" platform. Here's the breakdown of the Local File Inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2022-44786)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The "ApriPagina.do" endpoint directly includes a JSP page based on the "href" URL parameter without proper sanitization.
- Directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..;/`) are accepted.
- The server checks if the `href` parameter ends in `.jsp` before processing it.
- The Apache Tomcat web container parses the path, stripping everything after a semicolon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI)
- Lack of proper input sanitization on the `href` parameter.
- Tomcat behavior of stripping parameters after semicolons is leveraged to bypass the `.jsp` check.
- Improper validation allows directory traversal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files (except JSP pages) within the web application's root directory.
- Can be used to expose sensitive configuration files (e.g., `WEB-INF/web.xml`).
- Leaks internal details about the software, including class files and XML configurations

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with the `href` parameter to include a path with directory traversal sequences and a `.jsp` suffix, which is then bypassed by the Tomcat server stripping the parameter.
  - Example: `https://host/DL229/ApriPagina.do?href=..;/..;/WEB-INF/web.xml;index.jsp`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker only needs the ability to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint
