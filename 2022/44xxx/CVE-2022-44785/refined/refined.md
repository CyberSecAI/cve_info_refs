The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, and includes details for CVE-2022-44785.

**CVE-2022-44785: Multiple SQL Injections**

*   **Root Cause:** The application constructs SQL queries using user-controlled input without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The `cfamm` parameter in the `GetListaEnti.do` functionality of the LFS, Vigilanza, and DL229 modules is vulnerable to SQL injection. This vulnerability is accessible without authentication.
    *   **Authenticated Time-Based SQL Injection:** Multiple parameters in the `Trova.do` functionality of the LFS, Vigilanza, and DL229 modules are vulnerable. These include `defCampoN`, `filtro`, and `CampoX_conf`. In addition, the `trovaAddWhere` parameter in `ApriPagina.do` is vulnerable. These vulnerabilities require authentication.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can extract the entire database content.
    *   **Data Modification:** Attackers can perform INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE operations on the database, as the underlying database is PostgreSQL and supports batched queries.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** By manipulating the `cfamm` URL parameter of the `GetListaEnti.do` functionality.
    *   **Authenticated Time-Based SQL Injection:** By manipulating the POST body parameters such as `defCampoN`, `filtro`, and `CampoX_conf` when performing searches via the `Trova.do` functionality.  The `trovaAddWhere` parameter in the POST request to `ApriPagina.do` is also vulnerable to SQL injection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   For the unauthenticated SQL injection, no prior authentication is needed.
    *   For authenticated SQL injections, the attacker must have valid credentials to access the vulnerable functionalities (`Trova.do` and `ApriPagina.do`).
