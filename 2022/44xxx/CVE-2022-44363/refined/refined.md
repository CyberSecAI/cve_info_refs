Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in the `/goform/setSnmpInfo` endpoint of the Tenda i21 router firmware.
*   The `snmpEn` parameter, which is user-controlled, is directly used in a `sprintf` function without proper size validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow due to the uncontrolled size of the `snmpEn` parameter being used in the `sprintf` function which copies the user controlled data into a fixed-size stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact is a crash of the router due to the stack overflow.
*   **Remote Code Execution (Potential):** The document mentions that the researcher was able to achieve a crash and indicates the possibility of crafting an exploit to achieve root shell access on the router. This would allow a remote attacker full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setSnmpInfo` endpoint.
*   **`snmpEn` Parameter:** The payload is injected through the `snmpEn` parameter within the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable router. This could be on the local network or, if the router is exposed, from the internet.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP POST request with the malicious payload included in the `snmpEn` parameter.
*  **Authentication:** The provided exploit requires the `Cookie: password=1111` header, which suggests the need for some level of authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a large string of "a"s as the `snmpEn` parameter.
*   The vulnerability is present in Tenda i21 firmware version V1.0.0.14(4656).
*   The document includes images, which further help understand the vulnerable function
*   The description is more detailed than the standard CVE description.
