Package        : net-snmp
Version        : 5.7.3+dfsg-5+deb10u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-44792 CVE-2022-44793
Debian Bug     : 1024020

menglong2234 discovered NULL pointer exceptions in net-snmp, a suite of
Simple Network Management Protocol applications, which could could
result in debian of service.

CVE-2022-44792

    A remote attacker (with write access) could trigger a NULL
    dereference while handling ipDefaultTTL via a crafted UDP packet.

CVE-2022-44793

    A remote attacker (with write access) could trigger a NULL
    dereference while handling ipv6IpForwarding via a crafted UDP
    packet.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.7.3+dfsg-5+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp packages.

For the detailed security status of net-snmp please refer to
its security tracker page at:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| `handle_ipDefaultTTL()` in `agent/mibgroup/ip-mib/ip_scalars.c` in Net-SNMP from 5.8 to latest(5.9.3) version has a NULL Pointer Exception bug that can be used by an unauthenticated attacker to remotely cause the instance to crash via a crafted UDP packet, resulting in Denial of Service. The PoC is [here](https://gist.github.com/menglong2234/b7bc13ae1a144f47cc3c95a7ea062428).  After sending an SNMPSET packet with a varlist [1.3.6.1.2.1.4.2.0, NULL], snmpd deamon handles the packet with `handle_ipDefaultTTL()`, in which `requests->requestvb->val.integer` reference the `val` pointer that is NULL. Then snmpd deamon crashes due to segmentation fault.  To fix this vulnerability, some pre-reference check should be perfrom like `if(!requests->requestvb->val) {return SNMP_ERR_GENERR;}`. |

| Hi, menglong2234, and thank you for this bug report. However, rather than saying that it is an unauthenticated attacker, it is more appropriate to say that it is someone with write credentials - your proof of concept does nothing unless the "private" community is configured for write access.  If there is a device with the "private" community configured for write access by default, it is appropriate to file a bug report with that device vendor - that is a severe configuration error. |

| I think you're right, describing it as *unauthenticated attacker* isn't accurate. For version 2c, which does not lack security validation, you need to "guess" the field to be able to do that. XD |

| If you ask me, SNMPv1 and SNMPv2c should not be used except for experimentation in isolated networks, even for read-only use. When SET is involved, it is even more important to use the strong authentication available in SNMPv3. |

| You are right, only SNMPv3 should be used in real production environments. However the fact is there are a large number of devices deployed with v1 and v2c, and my team still used v2c directly on devices with public IPs few years ago for configuration convenience. It really shouldn't continue to be done that way haha. |
