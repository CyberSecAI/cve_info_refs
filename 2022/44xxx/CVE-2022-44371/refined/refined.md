- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses a fixed key in `com.hope.shiro.config.ShiroConfig` to encrypt the `rememberMe` cookie parameter. This fixed key is also used for deserialization, leading to a deserialization vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Hardcoded cryptographic key:** The application uses a fixed, hardcoded key for encryption and decryption of the `rememberMe` cookie, which is a major security flaw.
    - **Deserialization vulnerability:** The application uses the same key for encrypting the data stored in the rememberMe cookie as it does to decrypt and deserialize the data. This allows for the injection of malicious serialized objects.
    - **Insecure dependency:** The application includes `commons-beanutils-1.9.4.jar`, which is a known vulnerable dependency that can be used to trigger remote code execution via deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can craft a malicious serialized payload, encrypt it with the known key, and inject it into the `rememberMe` cookie, resulting in arbitrary code execution on the server when the payload is deserialized.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `rememberMe` cookie. An attacker can manipulate this cookie to inject the malicious serialized payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to intercept or manipulate HTTP requests.
    - The attacker must obtain the fixed key either via source code inspection or by decrypting the encrypted rememberMe cookie.
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious serialized payload using the `commons-beanutils` library.
    - The attacker needs to know that the application uses a fixed key and vulnerable dependency, and how to exploit this.
