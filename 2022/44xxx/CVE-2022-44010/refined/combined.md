# Security Changelog

## Fixed in ClickHouse v24.5, 2024-08-01[​](#fixed-in-clickhouse-release-2024-08-01 "Direct link to Fixed in ClickHouse v24.5, 2024-08-01")

### [CVE-2024-6873](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/security/advisories/GHSA-432f-r822-j66f)[​](#CVE-2024-6873 "Direct link to CVE-2024-6873")

It is possible to redirect the execution flow of the ClickHouse server process from an unauthenticated vector by sending a specially crafted request to the ClickHouse server native interface. This redirection is limited to what is available within a 256-byte range of memory at the time of execution. This vulnerability was identified through our Bugbounty program and no known Proof of Concept Remote Code Execution (RCE) code has been produced or exploited.

Fix has been pushed to the following open-source versions: v23.8.15.35-lts, v24.3.4.147-lts, v24.4.2.141-stable, v24.5.1.1763, v24.6.1.4423-stable

ClickHouse Cloud uses different versioning and a fix for this vulnerability was applied to all instances running v24.2 onward.

### CVE-2021-43304[​](#cve-2021-43304 "Direct link to CVE-2021-43304")

Heap buffer overflow in ClickHouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. There is no verification that the copy operations in the LZ4::decompressImpl loop and especially the arbitrary copy operation `wildCopy<copy_amount>(op, ip, copy_end)`, don’t exceed the destination buffer’s limits.

### CVE-2021-43305[​](#cve-2021-43305 "Direct link to CVE-2021-43305")

Heap buffer overflow in ClickHouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. There is no verification that the copy operations in the LZ4::decompressImpl loop and especially the arbitrary copy operation `wildCopy<copy_amount>(op, ip, copy_end)`, don’t exceed the destination buffer’s limits. This issue is very similar to CVE-2021-43304, but the vulnerable copy operation is in a different wildCopy call.

### CVE-2021-42387[​](#cve-2021-42387 "Direct link to CVE-2021-42387")

Heap out-of-bounds read in ClickHouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. As part of the LZ4::decompressImpl() loop, a 16-bit unsigned user-supplied value ('offset') is read from the compressed data. The offset is later used in the length of a copy operation, without checking the upper bounds of the source of the copy operation.

### CVE-2021-42388[​](#cve-2021-42388 "Direct link to CVE-2021-42388")

Heap out-of-bounds read in ClickHouse's LZ4 compression codec when parsing a malicious query. As part of the LZ4::decompressImpl() loop, a 16-bit unsigned user-supplied value ('offset') is read from the compressed data. The offset is later used in the length of a copy operation, without checking the lower bounds of the source of the copy operation.
