Subject: CVE-2022-44635: Apache Fineract allowed an authenticated user to
 perform remote code execution due to path traversal

Severity: important

Description:

Apache Fineract allowed an authenticated user to perform remote code execution due to a path traversal vulnerability in a file upload component of Apache Fineract, allowing an attacker to run remote code.  This issue affects Apache Fineract version 1.8.0 and prior versions. We recommend users to upgrade to 1.8.1.
