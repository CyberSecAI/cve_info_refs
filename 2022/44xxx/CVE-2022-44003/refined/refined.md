Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-44003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the insufficient escaping of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks at various locations due to insecurely inserting user-controlled parameters into SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve all data stored within the database. This includes potentially sensitive information like subscriber emails and other application data.
- In some cases, the extracted data is included in the HTTP response header (e.g., "Location" header), indicating a potential information disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** SQL injection is possible through the web interface in multiple locations:
    -  Search function within the management interface ("Abonnenten - Verwaltung" > "Test-Verteiler")
   -  Unauthenticated remote attackers can inject SQL via base64 encoded URL parameter
   
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- In some cases, like the search function, authentication might be needed to access the vulnerable feature but other attacks, can be performed by unauthenticated users.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax and potentially the use of tools like `sqlmap` can help to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability exists at various locations within the application, indicating a structural problem in how SQL queries are constructed.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) section demonstrates the exploitation using SQL injection techniques such as UNION-based injection.
- The advisory recommends using prepared statements with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The vendor has been notified, but no solution is known as of the advisory's publication date.
- The advisory suggests that the issue is present in the BACKCLICK Professional 5.9.63 (On-Premises) version.
