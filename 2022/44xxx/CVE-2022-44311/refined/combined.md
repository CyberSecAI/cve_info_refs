| Hi there!  Great work on html2xhtml, I find myself using it quite often. While I was using the tool I created some fuzz tests to run in the background. A couple of test cases led to a segfault when using the '-t frameset' option, which led me to further investigate the crash. Valgrind I started with Valgrind, which reported an invalid read of size 4 in each of the test cases:  ``` ==1040381== Memcheck, a memory error detector ==1040381== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. ==1040381== Using Valgrind-3.18.1 and LibVEX;

| Thanks for testing html2xhtml and for reporting the issue you've found. The detail of your report and your example files have been quite helpful to triage the bug.  I've found the cause of the issue: the node received by `elm_close` was expected to be of type element but was of type comment instead. I've fixed it and your files don't cause a segmentation fault anymore. |
