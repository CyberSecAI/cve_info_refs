Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-44875

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an overly permissive access control list (ACL) for scripting within the KioWare for Windows application. Specifically, the application allows "High" trust level access to `about:blank` URLs. Since iframes without a `src` attribute default to `about:blank`, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into such an iframe, which then inherits the high trust level.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Scripting ACL:** The `_alwaysAllowedAclUrlsRegex` includes the user-writable program data directory and `about:blank`, which is overly broad and introduces vulnerabilities.
*   **Trust Level Inheritance:** Iframes with `about:blank` inherit the high trust level which is intended to be limited to specific trusted URLs.
*   **Unrestricted API Access:** The `KioUtils.Execute` API, which allows running code as local admin, becomes accessible due to the elevated trust level granted to attacker-controlled iframes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Privilege Escalation (LPE):** A low-privilege user with access to the kiosk can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, thereby gaining full control over the system.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If an attacker can get a kiosk to visit a webpage with the exploit, or leverages XSS on a page that the kiosk has access to, they can run arbitrary code as `nt authority\system`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker can host a webpage containing the exploit code. When a vulnerable Kiosk browser visits this page, the exploit will be triggered.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If there's an XSS vulnerability on a site the kiosk accesses, the attacker can inject the exploit code into the page, achieving the same result as the malicious webpage attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Kiosk:** The attacker needs access to a KioWare kiosk as a low-privilege user for local privilege escalation.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content or Leverage XSS:** To achieve remote code execution, the attacker needs a way to get the kiosk browser to load malicious HTML/JS code (either directly served or via XSS injection).

**Additional Details:**
* The `KioUtils.Execute` function allows the execution of arbitrary commands with elevated privileges. This, combined with the relaxed trust settings on `about:blank` URLs, allows an attacker to easily gain SYSTEM access.
*   The exploit code provided is concise: ` <script>let c=document.createElement("iframe");document.body.appendChild(c);c.contentWindow.eval("KioUtils.Execute('powershell',true)")</script> ` which will spawn a powershell process with SYSTEM privileges

This vulnerability is in KioWare for Windows.
