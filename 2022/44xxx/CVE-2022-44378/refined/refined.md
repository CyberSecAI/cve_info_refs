The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the Automotive Shop Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when deleting mechanic records which is then directly used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists in the `/asms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_mechanic` endpoint.
- Unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter is directly used in a database query.
- The `updatexml` function in the payload is used for error-based SQL injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, including the database name.
- The attacker can also potentially read other data, modify existing data, or execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database if the underlying database user allows it.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/asms/classes/Users.php?f=delete`
- The `id` parameter in the POST request is used to inject malicious SQL.
- The application does not properly sanitize the user input.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the database to craft malicious SQL queries.
- The attacker needs to have access to the application and know the vulnerable file.
- The attacker does not need to be an authenticated user, although the provided payload seems to be using an authenticated session (cookie `PHPSESSID`).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerable code is in `/asms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_mechanic` but the attacker uses `/asms/classes/Users.php?f=delete` in the example, suggesting that this may be another vulnerable location.
- The application uses `asms_db` database.
- The provided payload `id=3 and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+` uses the `updatexml` function to inject the SQL query that extracts the database name.
- The attacker has a login account "admin/admin123".
- The specific software version is Automotive Shop Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.
- The software is built with xmapp-php8.1 version
