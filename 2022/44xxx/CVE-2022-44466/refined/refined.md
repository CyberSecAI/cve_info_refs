The provided content is related to CVE-2022-44466.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network (AV:N), with a low attack complexity (AC:L). A low privileged user is required (PR:L), and the attack requires user interaction (UI:R). The scope of the attack is changed (S:C). The impact is limited to low confidentiality, integrity, and no availability impact (C:L/I:L/A:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access and a low privileged user account in the application. The attacker also needs to induce a user to interact with a crafted link or content in the context of the application.
