The provided content is related to CVE-2022-44381.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The password reset mechanism in Snipe-IT displays different messages based on whether the provided username exists in the system or not.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper Access Control (CWE-284), specifically username fingerprinting. The application does not handle password reset attempts for non-existent users in a way that protects against information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can fingerprint (enumerate) valid usernames on the Snipe-IT system. This information can be used to facilitate further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed through a crafted POST request to the `/password/reset` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the login page to acquire a CSRF token. The attacker does not need any existing account on the system.
