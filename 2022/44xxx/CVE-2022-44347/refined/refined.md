Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Sanitization Management System v1.0 by oretnom23 is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the `id` parameter within the `/php-sms/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate the `id` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by using SQL injection techniques such as `updatexml()`. In the provided example, the database name is extracted.
*   **Potential for Complete Database Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and the application's privileges, a successful SQL injection attack could lead to further compromise such as data modification or complete database takeover.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL: `/php-sms/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry&id=`.
*   **Manipulated `id` Parameter:** The attacker injects SQL code into the `id` parameter value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of HTTP requests to craft the malicious URL.
*   **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker must have knowledge of SQL syntax and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.

**More Detail than CVE Description:**

*   The provided content gives specific details about the vulnerable file (`/php-sms/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry&id=`), the affected parameter (`id`), the database name (`sms_db`), and provides a working SQL injection payload for extracting database information:
    `/php-sms/admin/?page=inquiries/view_inquiry&id=1%27%20and%20updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20database()),0x7e),0)--+`.
*   It also specifies the login credentials for the admin user: admin/admin123 which might help in reproducing the vulnerability.
*   The content also specifies the exact version of php used in developing the application: xmapp-php8.1
