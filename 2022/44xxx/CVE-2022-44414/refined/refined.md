Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `manage_service.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or validation, making it susceptible to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi) through the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as database names, table structures, and user credentials. The provided payload demonstrates this by extracting the database name using `select database()`.
- **Data Modification/Manipulation:**  Although not explicitly shown in the provided example, SQL injection vulnerabilities can allow attackers to modify or delete data.
- **Potential full system compromise:** In severe scenarios the attacker could gain full control of the database, potentially leading to full system takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious GET request to `manage_service.php` with a specially crafted SQL payload in the `id` parameter.
- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Exploitation involves manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL and how to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **Target Identification:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `manage_service.php` file and the vulnerable `id` parameter.
- **No authentication needed:** Based on the provided information, the SQLi can be exploited by the attacker without the need for authentication since the vulnerable file is in the `/admin/` folder.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided payload utilizes the `updatexml` function, along with `concat` to extract the database name, demonstrating a common technique for exploiting SQL injection.
- The content specifies that the software runs on PHP 8.1.
- The provided example includes the vulnerable file path, the vulnerable parameter, and an example of an HTTP request that could be used to exploit the vulnerability.
- The vendor's link provides the location from where the software can be obtained, further clarifying which system is affected.
