The provided content is related to CVE-2022-44365.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when copying the base64 decoded `oldPwd` parameter into a buffer using `strcpy`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow, triggered by sending an overly long base64 encoded string as the value of `oldPwd`. The vulnerable code does not perform a check on the length of the decoded string before copying it into a fixed-size buffer on the stack, thus overflowing it when the input is sufficiently large.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as the overflow causes the device to crash. It is likely that with further exploitation, an attacker could achieve remote code execution on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setSysPwd` endpoint. The `action` parameter must be set to `admin`, and the `oldPwd` parameter must contain a long base64 encoded string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected router on port 80. This may require the attacker to be on the same network as the router, or if remote management is enabled, from the internet if the port is exposed. The attacker needs to know that `password` cookie is set to value `1111` in order to pass the authentication.
