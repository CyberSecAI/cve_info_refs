{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `bookId` parameter of the `/LMS/admin/delete.php` file, allowing for SQL injection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive database information, modify data, or even take complete control of the database server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to `/LMS/admin/delete.php` with a malicious SQL query injected into the `bookId` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. The provided example uses a POST request. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated."
