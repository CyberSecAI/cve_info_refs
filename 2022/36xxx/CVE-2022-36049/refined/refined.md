    {
      "cve": "CVE-2022-36049",
      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a parsing issue within the `strvals` package used by the Helm SDK. Specific string inputs can cause the creation of large array data structures during parsing, leading to excessive memory consumption and an out-of-memory panic. This panic is unrecoverable, resulting in a denial of service.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
        ],
        "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a denial of service, as the affected component will crash due to an out-of-memory panic. In a multi-tenant environment, this could prevent other tenants from having their Helm releases reconciled.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. Malicious input strings are passed to the `strvals` package through command-line flags like `--set` and `--set-string` or other similar mechanisms within the Helm SDK or by directly using the affected function.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability, as providing the malformed input via command-line flags or another mechanism is usually a low privilege operation. No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.",
         "additional_details": "The vulnerability was discovered through fuzz testing by Ada Logics, sponsored by the CNCF, and it affects applications that use the `strvals` package from the Helm SDK to parse user-supplied input. The vulnerability is present in helm versions < v3.9.4. The fix is available in version v3.9.4"

      "is_related": true,
       "details": {
         "root_cause": "The Helm controller is vulnerable due to its integration with the Helm SDK's `strvals` package, which has a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, carefully crafted string inputs can cause excessive memory usage during the parsing of these strings into Go structures, triggering an out-of-memory panic.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption"
        ],
        "impact": "A successful attack will lead to a denial of service by making the Helm controller panic and stop processing reconciliations. In shared, multi-tenancy cluster environments, one tenant could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service to other tenants' Helm releases.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network-based. A malicious actor with low privileges can create a crafted HelmRelease with specific data inputs that cause the controller to panic.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs low privileges to create a HelmRelease that contains the malicious input and trigger the vulnerability. No user interaction is required.",
         "additional_details": "The vulnerability was found by oss-fuzz and the fix was addressed in flux2 versions v0.32.0 and helm-controller versions v0.23.0. The vulnerability is present in flux2 versions < v0.32.0 >= v0.0.17, and helm-controller versions < v0.23.0 >= v0.0.4"
