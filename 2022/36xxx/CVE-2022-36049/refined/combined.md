# Denial of service through string value parsing

Moderate

[mattfarina](/mattfarina)
published
GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh
Aug 24, 2022

## Package

gomod

helm.sh/helm/v3
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v3.9.3

## Patched versions

v3.9.4

## Description

Fuzz testing, by Ada Logics and sponsored by the CNCF, identified input to functions in the *strvals* package that can cause an out of memory panic. Out of memory panics cannot be recovered from. Applications that use functions from the *strvals* package in the Helm SDK can have a Denial of Service attack when they use this package and it panics.

### Impact

The *strvals* package contains a parser that turns strings into Go structures. For example, the Helm client has command line flags like `--set`, `--set-string`, and others that enable the user to pass in strings that are merged into the values. The *strvals* package converts these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory panic.

Applications that use the *strvals* package in the Helm SDK to parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from.

The Helm Client will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm client.

### Patches

This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4.

### Workarounds

SDK users can validate strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing significant memory usage before passing them to the *strvals* functions.

### For more information

Helm's security policy is spelled out in detail in our [SECURITY](https://github.com/helm/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md) document.

### Credits

Disclosed by Ada Logics in a fuzzing audit sponsored by CNCF.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-36055

### Weaknesses

# Helm Controller denial of service

High

[hiddeco](/hiddeco)
published
GHSA-p2g7-xwvr-rrw3
Sep 7, 2022

## Package

gomod

github.com/fluxcd/flux2
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< v0.32.0 >= v0.0.17

## Patched versions

v0.32.0

gomod

github.com/fluxcd/helm-controller
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

< v0.23.0 >= v0.0.4

v0.23.0

## Description

Helm controller is tightly integrated with the Helm SDK. [A vulnerability](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-7hfp-qfw3-5jxh) found in the Helm SDK allows for specific data inputs to cause high memory consumption, which in some platforms could cause the controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations.

### Impact

In a shared cluster multi-tenancy environment, a tenant could create a HelmRelease that makes the controller panic, denying all other tenants from their Helm releases being reconciled.

### Credits

The initial crash bug was reported by [oss-fuzz](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz). The Flux Security team produced the first exploit and worked together with the Helm Security team to ensure that both projects were patched timely.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in any of the affected repositories.
* Contact us at the CNCF Flux Channel.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
