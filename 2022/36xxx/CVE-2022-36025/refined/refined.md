- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An error in 32-bit signed and unsigned types during the calculation of available gas in CALL operations (including DELEGATECALL). This results in incorrect gas being passed to called contracts and incorrect gas being returned after call execution. Specifically, negative 64-bit gas values and differences in gas allocation can trigger the issue.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect gas calculation in CALL operations due to a flaw in handling 32-bit signed and unsigned types. This leads to discrepancies in gas allocation and return values when executing smart contract calls.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - In networks with multiple EVM implementations: different state roots than expected, leading to consensus failures.
    - In networks with a single EVM implementation: execution with more gas than requested, potentially exceeding gas limits.
    - In both scenarios, unintended behavior of smart contracts can be triggered and consensus can be impacted.

- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks. An attacker can craft transactions that exploit this gas calculation error, allowing them to potentially execute with more gas than intended.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to submit transactions to the network, and needs to craft transactions that will exploit the flaw in the gas calculation. No special privileges or user interaction are required.

- **CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)
- **CVSS Metrics:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
- **CWE:** CWE-196 (Unsigned to Signed Conversion Error)
