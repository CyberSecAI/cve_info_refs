  "CVE-2022-36313": {
    "related_to_content": true,
    "root_cause": "A vulnerability in the `file-type` Node.js package, specifically in how it parses Matroska (MKV) files, leading to a potential infinite loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of malformed MKV files",
       "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local file access via crafted MKV file"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "A user needs to provide the affected software a malformed MKV file or a stream with a specific byte pattern. A user-triggered action (UI interaction) is needed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the `file-type` package versions prior to 16.5.4 and 17.x prior to 17.1.3. The fix involves correcting the logic for reading MKV file elements which could get into infinite loop when certain bytes are encountered. A crafted MKV file can trigger an infinite loop during file type detection which can lead to a DoS."
