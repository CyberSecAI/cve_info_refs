Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `jizhicms` version 2.3.1. The `molds` parameter in the POST request to `/index.php/admins/Fields/get_fields.html` is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `molds` parameter which is then used in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. In this specific case, the attacker was able to use stacked queries and a sleep command for testing.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed through an HTTP POST request to the specified endpoint `/index.php/admins/Fields/get_fields.html`.
    *   **Parameter Manipulation:** The `molds` parameter within the POST request's body is used to inject SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker likely needs to have some knowledge of the application's backend to identify the vulnerable parameters and craft the SQL injection payload. In this instance, the attacker captured the request when accessing the backend->Interactive Management -> comment list and crafted the payload from that.
