Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36338:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `FwBlockServiceSmm` driver within InsydeH2O firmware.
- The driver registers a Software SMI (System Management Interrupt) handler.
- This handler attempts to locate a specific protocol using `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` before the `EFI_EVENT_EXIT_BOOT_SERVICES` event is triggered.
- `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` is located outside of System Management RAM (SMRAM), making it accessible to a potential attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SMM Callout Vulnerability:** The core issue is that the SMM handler uses boot services that reside in unprotected memory (outside of SMRAM). This is unsafe as the attacker can potentially control execution within the boot services.
- **Insecure Use of Boot Services in SMM:**  Calling `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES` from within SMM code is dangerous because these services are designed to be used in the pre-boot environment (DXE phase), not in the isolated SMM environment.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploiting the callout allows an attacker to gain control of the SMM environment, thereby enabling them to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate privileges from ring 0 (OS level) to ring -2 (SMM level).
- **Arbitrary Code Execution in SMM:**  Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code within SMM, an environment more privileged than the OS and isolated from it.
- **Firmware Backdoor/Implant:**  Arbitrary code execution in SMM enables bypassing SMM-based SPI flash protections allowing for the installation of persistent firmware backdoors or implants into the BIOS that survives OS reinstalls.
- **Bypassing UEFI Security Mechanisms:** The vulnerability can potentially be leveraged to bypass security features provided by the UEFI firmware, such as Secure Boot and hypervisor memory isolation.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Compromised DXE Phase:**  An attacker needs the ability to execute code in the DXE phase (pre-boot environment) to hijack the vulnerable SMI call to `EFI_BOOT_SERVICES`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Code Execution in DXE phase:** The attacker must be capable of executing code in the DXE phase of the boot process.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by the Binarly efiXplorer team.
- The issue is addressed in specific versions of InsydeH2O firmware across different kernel versions.
- Binarly assigned the internal identifier BRLY-2022-017 to this vulnerability.
- Insyde assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2022-36338.

This vulnerability is considered high severity, with a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (according to Insyde) or 8.2 (according to Binarly).
