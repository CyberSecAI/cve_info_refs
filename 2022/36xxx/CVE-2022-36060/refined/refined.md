- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to prototype pollution. Events sent with special strings in key places can disrupt or impede the matrix-react-sdk from functioning properly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prototype pollution (CWE-1321)
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Exploitation can cause the matrix-react-sdk to crash, specifically in rendering rooms or event tiles. This could lead to denial of service for the affected users, as certain parts of the application will not function correctly while other parts may still appear functional.
- **Attack vectors:** Network
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need privileges or user interaction to perform the attack. The attacker can be remote.
