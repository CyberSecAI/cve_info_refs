How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

This does what it says on the tin: provides a floating div which I use for special offers and anything else that I don’t want as part of the web page.
It’s easy to use since it gives you a short code to embed and support has been great for me.
It allows you some basic theming like borders, background image etc.

Easy, great, very useful plugin. The support is fantastic: sometimes it was only minutes or couple hours after my request, and I have on my email a full complete answer and code suggestions for improve my page for the plugin. One of the best post-buying experience. Congratulations for your work.

This plugin works great, I have the Pro version and can customise it accordingly to match my Website.
BUT! if you think the plug-in is great wait till you experience the backup service and support from the developer. WOW! get the app with confidence.
I am very impressed especially with the new option which allows you to select what platform this floating div will appear. My floating div was quite large and therefore I opted to switch it off on mobiles as it would block the screen.

Plugin looks promising but essential features are unavailable in free tier.
There is no option to enable users to close the floating content. Only PRO version as i see.
Please change that.
