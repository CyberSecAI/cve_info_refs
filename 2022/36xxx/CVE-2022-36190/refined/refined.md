Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap use-after-free error located in the `gf_isom_dovi_config_get` function within the `isomedia/avc_ext.c` file, specifically at line 2490.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Use-After-Free:** The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most immediate impact is a program crash, as seen in the provided crash output.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Use-after-free vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited to execute arbitrary code by overwriting freed memory with malicious data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input File:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted MP4 file (`poc.zip` provided by the reporter). The `MP4Box` tool is used to process the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted MP4 file to a vulnerable instance of the GPAC framework.
- The attacker must induce the vulnerable GPAC application (MP4Box in this case) to parse the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using AddressSanitizer, which is a memory error detector, and it was triggered during the parsing of an MP4 file.
- The report mentions a possible misreport by ASAN and the actual vulnerability might be a heap-buffer-overflow (although the primary report from ASan is heap-use-after-free)
- The issue was fixed along with a related issue ([#2218](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/2218)).
