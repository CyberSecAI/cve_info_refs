Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper request handling mechanism. This flaw allowed unauthenticated access to user API keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The core issue is the ability to bypass authentication and directly access user API keys.
*   **Insecure API Access:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized retrieval of API keys.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized API Access:**  An attacker can retrieve the API key of any valid user without proper authentication.
*   **External API Access:** Once an API key is obtained, the attacker can access external APIs using the compromised credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through a network request that targets the vulnerable request handling mechanism. The content suggests this vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   An attacker does not need to be logged into the application to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker does not require any specific privileges or roles.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

The following products and builds are affected:

*   **OpManager, OpManager Plus, OpManager MSP, Network Configuration Manager, NetFlow Analyzer, Firewall Analyzer, OpUtils:**
    *   Builds between 126113 and 126117 (Fixed in 126118)
    *   Builds between 126100 and 126103 (Fixed in 126104)
