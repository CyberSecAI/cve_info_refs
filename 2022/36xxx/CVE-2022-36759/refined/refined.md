Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `res_id` parameter of the `dishes.php` page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the `res_id` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring any prior authentication or login to the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, personal information, and potentially other application data. This is demonstrated by the provided SQLMap commands used to extract the database name, tables, columns, and contents of the admin table.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (via `load_file`):** The proof of concept demonstrates the use of the `load_file` function, which, if enabled on the database, could allow for the reading of local files on the server. This could lead to further information disclosure or in some scenarios, arbitrary code execution if writing capabilities are also enabled.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `dishes.php` page, specifically by manipulating the `res_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable server hosting the online food ordering system. No other special capabilities are required.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to construct HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.

**Additional Information:**
- **Tooling:** The attacker used sqlmap to identify and exploit the vulnerability.
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A PoC request is provided demonstrating the injection using the `load_file` function.
- **Affected Parameter:** The `res_id` parameter in `dishes.php` is identified as vulnerable.
