| **Password Manager for IIS User Manual**  Version 2.0 Documentation Version 2.02 Welcome Welcome to Password Manager for IIS from Adiscon.  This tool allows any user to change his or her NT domain password via a web interface. There is no need for to connect to the server directly via NT networking. All the users needs is a standard web browser and an HTTP connection to the NT web server. This connection can be via a proxy server.  This documentation covers the version 2.0. Any comments are appreciated at "Info@Adiscon.com".  Product updates as well as important announcements can be found at "<http://www.PasswordManager.com>" (if that URL ever changes, please try <http://www.Adiscon.com>). |

| Year 2000 statement Password Manager for IIS does not include any time or date oriented functionality or code. Thus, it can be safely assumed that the product itself will perform well in the year 2000 and above.  However, it is dependant on the operating system and web server it is running on. Please see the supplying vendors notices for their product's year 2000 compliance. In the case of Password Manger for IIS, this is mainly Microsoft (which can be found at <http://www.microsoft.com>). Other vendor information might also apply, e. g. if you use a third party IP stack. Installation Password Manager for IIS is high performing tool using only minimal system resources. It also doesn't require an extended installation process. System Requirements This product is compatible with all versions of Microsoft IIS. It supports Windows NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows 2003 and Windows XP.  Active Directory users please note: Password Manager for IIS does run without any problems on Windows 2000. Many users use it with great success in Active Directory environments. However, Password Manager uses NT domain API calls to change the password, so you need to refer to the short name to all objects and domains. The Installation Process Actual installation is very straightforward  1. unzip the install set- copy PasswordManager.dll (the ISAPI extension DLL) to any web directory on your      IIS you like. Make sure, you have excute permissions inside IIS for this      directory set (not only scripting!).- copy the sample password change dialog and customize it according to your needs        (or create your own from scratch).   The product does not perform or require any registry modifications. Uninstallation There is no need for any formal uninstallation process. Simply delete the ISAPI extension DLL (PasswordManager.dll) as well as any page you are using Password Manger for IIS on. Usage Password Manager for IIS is a standard ISAPI extension callable from any HTTP form. You can include it into your web site by creating a simple (or sophisticated ;-) ) web form with your favourite HTML editor (like Microsoft Frontpage or Macromedia DreamWeaver).  The "ACTION" tag of the html form must point to the PasswordManager.dll ISAPI extension. Be sure to specify the correct path to the DLL. This is depending on where you copied the DLL to and where your actual form resides. If ever in doubt, use a full name like: http://www.yourserver.com/yourdirectory/passwordmanger.dll. The form needs to include the following fields:   | **FieldName** | **Used for** | | --- | --- | | LANGUAGE | Select language for response text generated by Password Manager for IIS. Supported values are "DE" for German, "BR" for Brazilian Portugese and "EN" for English. This field can be omitted and defaults to English. | | DOMAIN | Name of the NT Domain that is to be used for password changes. Only users from this domain can change their password (if you have multiple domains, the users needs to enter the correct one or select it from a list box). Please note: if you run Password Manager for IIS in a workgroup environmen, this parameter must hold the computer name, NOT the workgroup name!  This field is mandatory. | | RESULTURL | The URL PasswordManager redirects to after it tried to change the password. This URL is called from within Password Manager. We recommend it to be a fully qualified name (e.g. starting with HTTP). This URL will be passed the outcome of the operation as parameter "state". It is up to the page residing at this URL to decode "state" and provide feedback to the user. The URL is called as follows: RESULTURL?state=OperationStatus  See appendix for statuses.  Please note: unregistered versions of Password Manager will redirect after a 10 second delay only. If this field is not specified, Password Manager provides a default status form. | | USER | NT User name (without domain part) of the users who's password needs to be changed. | | OLDPWD | Old password | | NEWPWD | New password | | NEWPWDCONFIRM | Confirmation of new password. NEWPWD & NEWPWDCONFIRM need to be identical, otherwise password manager for IIS does not change the users' password. |   Sample The following is a simple sample form. It assumes that PasswordManager is stored in a directory named "ISAPI" that is on the same directory level as the one the form is stored in. One example might be:  "<web-root>/forms" for the form's html file and "<web-root>/ISAPI" for the extension DLL  `<html> <head> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=iso-8859-1"> <title>Change Domain Password</title> </head> <body> <p><strong><big>Change Domain Password</big></strong></p> <form method="post" action="../isapi/PasswordManager.dll"> <input type="hidden" name="Language" value="EN"> <input type="hidden" name="Domain" value="YOURNTDOMAIN"> <div align="left"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"> <tr> <td><strong>User Name</strong></td> <td><input type="text" name="User" size="20"></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Current Password</strong></td> <td><input type="password" name="OldPwd" size="20"></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>New Password</strong></td> <td><input type="password" name="NewPwd" size="20"></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>New Password Confirmation</strong></td> <td><input type="password" name="NewPwdConfirm" size="20"></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong></strong></td> <td><input type="submit" value="Change Password!">     <input type="reset"> </td> </tr> </table> </div> </form> </body> </html>`  The example above is for a simple change password dialog with no customised result page. Inside the install set is a more complex sample.  These sample assumes that the sample-form.htm and MyResultPage.asp files are copied in a web root. There should be a directory named "isapi" in wich PasswordManger.dll resides. Sample-form.htm is basically the same sample as above, but references MyResultPage.asp as a customized result page. Once PasswordManager has done it's actions, it calls this page with a parameter "state". MyResultPage.asp evaluates this "state" variable and displays an appropriate message. You are free to do whatever you want inside this result page.  Please note that the unregistered version of Password Manager has a delay of 10 seconds before redirecting to the result page. The registered version will immediately redirect. Status Codes The following status codes are used by Password Manager to indicate the outcome of the change password operation:   | **Code** | **Meaning** | | --- | --- | | 0 | success (all others indicate failure) | | 5 or 53 | PDC not found. Most probable causes are:  * Domain name misspelled* PDC actually down (powered off or otherwise offline)* If Password Manager for IIS is to be used in a Workgroup environment, Parameter       DOMAIN must hold the computer name, NOT the workgroup name.* User restriction "Can't change password" checked in user manager | | 86 | Old Password incorrect | | 2245 | New password is too short. | | 2221 | Invalid Username. Most probably typo, user account does not exist. | | 4294967295 | Fields "New Password" and "New Password Confirm" do not match. |  Version History This short history shall provide you with some background information about the versions available as well as their pros and cons. 1.0 This is the initial release. 1.1 Some minor bug fixes. 2.0  * Fully compatible with Windows 2000 (tested with build 2072)* Error Reporting Improved (less "error xx occured")* Portugese Language versions available* Paramter "RESULTURL" added.

Any questions can be directed at Info@Adiscon.com. Are there any restrictions in the unregistered version? Nope - we don't like "crippleware". However, the unregistred version does identify itself as unregistered in its responses to password change requests. Based on experience we needed to introduced a slight delay whith the RESULTURL version - if we hadn't done this, nobody would ever see the "unregistered" message. We think this is fair.
