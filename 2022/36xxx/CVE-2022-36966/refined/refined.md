Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36966:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from insufficient control on URL parameters, leading to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). This means that a user could manipulate URL parameters to access or modify data they should not have permissions to.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The core issue is that the application does not properly validate user authorization before allowing access to resources based on IDs in URL parameters.
    *   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The system fails to restrict access based on the user's actual permissions, allowing unauthorized actions when manipulating URL parameters.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with Node Management rights could view and edit all nodes within the SolarWinds Platform, regardless of their intended scope. This includes potentially sensitive information, and ability to make unauthorized modifications.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector involves a malicious user with Node Management rights manipulating URL parameters within the SolarWinds Platform web interface to access and modify nodes beyond their authorized scope.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a valid account with Node Management rights within the SolarWinds Platform.
    *   The attacker needs to be familiar with how to manipulate URL parameters to access arbitrary nodes.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was found in SolarWinds Platform 2022.3 and previous versions, as well as Orion Platform 2020.2.6 HF5 and previous versions.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in SolarWinds Platform 2022.4 RC1.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 5.9 (Medium).
