## Vulnerability Analysis for CVE-2022-36906

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The OpenShift Deployer Plugin does not perform permission checks in a method implementing form validation. Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing permission check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The use of GET requests for sensitive operations leads to cross-site request forgery.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to:

*   Connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified username and password.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
*   **CSRF:** An attacker can trick a user into making a malicious request by exploiting the lack of POST request requirement.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs Overall/Read permission in Jenkins.
*  The attacker needs knowledge of the Jenkins instance.
