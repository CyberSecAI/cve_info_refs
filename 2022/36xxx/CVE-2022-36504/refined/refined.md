The provided content is related to CVE-2022-36504.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `Edit_BasicSSID` function of the H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router. The `sscanf` function is used to format input with `%[^;]`, which is a greedy match, and if the size of the input data exceeds the buffer `V31`, a stack overflow occurs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to insecure use of `sscanf` with a greedy match specifier.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial-of-service (DoS) can be achieved by crafting specific data.
    - A stable root shell can be obtained without authorization through a carefully constructed payload.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with a malicious `param` value within the `Edit_BasicSSID` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. They don't need prior authentication since they can gain a root shell without authorization.
