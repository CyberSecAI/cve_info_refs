Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an OTP (One-Time Password) brute-force issue present in the Password Sync Agent of ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus. This issue could potentially affect integrated third-party applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient OTP Length:** The OTP length was not sufficiently long, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
*   **Inadequate API Throttling:** The API throttling mechanism had an insufficient threshold, failing to prevent brute-force attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers could exploit this vulnerability using "specialized, highly sophisticated machines" to reset passwords for accounts connected through the Password Sync Agent.
*   Successful exploitation could lead to attackers taking control over integrated third-party applications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves brute-forcing the OTPs used by the Password Sync Agent.
*   The attack requires sophisticated methods and resources to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Attackers would require "specialized, highly sophisticated machines" to perform brute-force attacks effectively.
*   Attackers would need to target the Password Sync Agent and its OTP mechanism.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor has addressed the vulnerability in build 6218 by:
    *   Increasing the OTP length to 16 characters.
    *   Significantly decreasing the API throttling threshold to mitigate brute-force attempts.

**Affected Versions:**
* Builds 6217 and older are affected.
