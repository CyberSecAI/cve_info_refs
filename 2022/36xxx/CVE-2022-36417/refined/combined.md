I have been using this plugin for years now‚Äìbeginning with PHP 5.6.X, and currently running under WP v5.9.X and PHP 7.4.X. I have also done a local Laragon dev under PHP 8.1.X and it still rolls on!
It is completely configurable to mimic the CSS of your theme‚Äìand while is a bit of useful fluff‚Äìit certainly adds charm to a WP site.

The use of 'wp\_head' hook to inject javascript code that requires jQuery may fail. I changed it to 'wp\_footer'
Calling jQuery.noConflict() also makes other parts of the website that use $ to call jQuery fail. It is really unnecessary to call .noConflict() so I recommend removing it.

The new version of this plugin avails the options under the Settings Menu under 3D Tag Cloud. A quick update of the settings and adding a few quick tags to the posts gave me a nice addition to alternative prism view of my site. I love it. I use in on GiantLeap.com for now and will add to others I am sure.

Great idea, but not customizable with no options for colours, different tags, and locations (i.e. sidebar, bottom, etc).
It seems to also have a bug that remains on different pages.
