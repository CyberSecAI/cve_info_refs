Follow-up to [#4540](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540)

We can now mock functions that are user-defined:

```
package test

f(_) = 1 {
    input.x = "x"
}
p = y {
    y := f(1) with f as 2
}

```

...following the same scoping rules as laid out for built-in mocks.

The replacement can be a value (replacing all calls), or a built-in,

or another non-built-in function.

Also addresses bugs in the previous slice:

* topdown/evalCall: account for empty rules result from indexer
* topdown/eval: capture value replacement in PE could panic

Note: in PE, we now drop 'with' for function mocks of any kind:

These are always fully replaced in the saved support modules, so

this should be OK.

When keeping them, we'd also have to either copy the existing definitions

into the support module; or create a function stub in it.

Fixes [#4449](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4449).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| This might be a somewhat contrived example, but when the same function is mocked at multiple layers in the "call stack", my initial expectation would have been that the outer-most `with` would "win".  ``` package mocking.user_defined  f(_) = 1 {     input.x = "x" }  p = y {      y := f(1) with f as 2  }  test_p {     v := p with f as 3     v == 2 # is 3 expected here? } ```  Is there a line of thought here that I'm not grasping, or thinking of? |

| This might be a somewhat contrived example, but when the same function is mocked at multiple layers in the "call stack", my initial expectation would have been that the outer-most with would "win".  Yeah, it's the other way around, I'm afraid. Every new `with` encountered adds a new frame onto the with-stack, and when a function is to be evaluated, the lookups (for replacements) go top-to-bottom.  So when you evaluate `f(1)`, the stack of withs is `[ {f: 3}, {f: 2} ]`, and the rightmost one "wins".  It's the same as plain data mocks, e.g.  ``` package ex  f = 1 {     input.x = "x" }  p = y {      y := f with f as 2  }  test_p {     v := p with f as 3     v == 2 # is 3 expected here? }  ``` |

Just a personal preference, but I like it when the `note` is the first field. Helps me getting an overview, as I then can see it as the "title", with the "body" of the test case following it.

But browsing some other test cases, I see this is the norm.

ast+topdown+planner: allow for mocking built-in functions via \"with\" (#4540)

With this change, we can replace calls to built-in functions via `with`. The replacement
can either be a value -- which will be used as the return value for every call to the
mocked built-in -- or a reference to a non-built-in function -- when the results need
to depend on the call's arguments.

Compiler, topdown, and planner have been adapted in this change. The included
docs changes describe the replacement options further.

Fixes first part of #4449. (Missing are non-built-in functions as mock targets.)

cmd/capabilities: expose capabilities through CLI (#4588)

There is a new command argument \"capabilities\". With this, it is
possible to print the current capabilities version, show all
capabilities versions & print any capabilities version, without the need
of a file. Moreover, for the other commands which use the --capabilities
flag, it is possible to give only the version number, without specifying
a file. However, there are no breaking changes for those who use the
capabilities file as an input for the flag. Unit tests were also
written, in order to test the new argument and the changes made in ast.

status: Remove activeRevision label on all but one metric (#4600)

Having one activeRevision label on each of the prometheus metrics emitted
by the status plugin has proven to be problematic with a large number of
bundles. So with this change,

1. we keep the activeRevision label (just on) the last_success_bundle_activation metric.
2. the gauge gets reset, so we only keep the last active_revision (instead of keeping
   them all and therefore avoiding the situation where the /metrics output grows indefinitely)

Fixes #4584.

ast+topdown+planner: replacement of non-built-in functions via 'with' (#4616)

Follow-up to #4540

We can now mock functions that are user-defined:

    package test

    f(_) = 1 {
        input.x = \"x\"
    }
    p = y {
        y := f(1) with f as 2
    }

...following the same scoping rules as laid out for built-in mocks.
The replacement can be a value (replacing all calls), or a built-in,
or another non-built-in function.

Also addresses bugs in the previous slice:
* topdown/evalCall: account for empty rules result from indexer
* topdown/eval: capture value replacement in PE could panic

Note: in PE, we now drop 'with' for function mocks of any kind:

These are always fully replaced in the saved support modules, so
this should be OK.

When keeping them, we'd also have to either copy the existing definitions
into the support module; or create a function stub in it.

Fixes #4449.

downloader: support for downloading bundles from an OCI registry (#4558)

Initial support for #4518.

Configuration uses the 'services' config for registries, via the \"type: oci\" field.
Bundles configured to pull from that service will then use OCI.

```
services:
  ghcr-registry:
    url: https://ghcr.io
    type: oci
bundles:
  authz:
    service: ghcr-registry
    resource: ghcr.io/${ORGANIZATION}/${REPOSITORY}:${TAG}
    persist: true
    polling:
      min_delay_seconds: 60
      max_delay_seconds: 120
persistence_directory: ${PERSISTENCE_PATH}
```

Service credentials are supported: if you want to pull from a private registry,
use
```
services:
  ghcr-registry:
    url: https://ghcr.io
    type: oci
    credentials:
      bearer:
        token: ${GH_PAT}
```

If no `persistence_directory` is configured, the data is stored in a directory under /tmp.

See docs/devel/OCI.md for manual steps to test this feature with some
OCI registry (like ghcr.io).

ast+topdown+planner: replacement of non-built-in functions via 'with' ([open-policy-agent#4616](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616))

Follow-up to [open-policy-agent#4540](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540)

We can now mock functions that are user-defined:

    package test

    f(_) = 1 {
        input.x = "x"
    }
    p = y {
        y := f(1) with f as 2
    }

...following the same scoping rules as laid out for built-in mocks.
The replacement can be a value (replacing all calls), or a built-in,
or another non-built-in function.

Also addresses bugs in the previous slice:
* topdown/evalCall: account for empty rules result from indexer
* topdown/eval: capture value replacement in PE could panic

Note: in PE, we now drop 'with' for function mocks of any kind:

These are always fully replaced in the saved support modules, so
this should be OK.

When keeping them, we'd also have to either copy the existing definitions
into the support module; or create a function stub in it.

Fixes [open-policy-agent#4449](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4449).

# This is the commit message [open-policy-agent#23](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/23):

downloader: support for downloading bundles from an OCI registry ([open-policy-agent#4558](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4558))

Initial support for [open-policy-agent#4518](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4518).

Configuration uses the 'services' config for registries, via the "type: oci" field.
Bundles configured to pull from that service will then use OCI.

```
services:
  ghcr-registry:
    url: <https://ghcr.io>
    type: oci
bundles:
  authz:
    service: ghcr-registry
    resource: ghcr.io/${ORGANIZATION}/${REPOSITORY}:${TAG}
    persist: true
    polling:
      min_delay_seconds: 60
      max_delay_seconds: 120
persistence_directory: ${PERSISTENCE_PATH}
```

Service credentials are supported: if you want to pull from a private registry,
use
```
services:
  ghcr-registry:
    url: <https://ghcr.io>
    type: oci
    credentials:
      bearer:
        token: ${GH_PAT}
```

If no `persistence_directory` is configured, the data is stored in a directory under /tmp.

See docs/devel/OCI.md for manual steps to test this feature with some
OCI registry (like ghcr.io).

Looks like we don't get frames for this.

Also, there is currentlty no better way than comparing the message,
as the trap code isn't surfaced (yet).

# Compiler: Bypass of WithUnsafeBuiltins using "with" keyword to mock functions

High

[srenatus](/srenatus)
published
GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr
Sep 7, 2022

## Package

gomod

Open Policy Agent
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= v0.40.0, < v0.44.0

## Patched versions

v0.43.1, v0.44.0

## Description

### Impact

The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe — and as such rejected — by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn’t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`.

The same method is exposed via `rego.UnsafeBuiltins` in the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package.

When provided e.g. the `http.send` built-in function to `WithUnsafeBuiltins`, the following policy would still compile, and call the `http.send` function with the arguments provided to the `is_object` function when evaluated:

```
package policy

foo := is_object({
    "method": "get",
    "url": "https://www.openpolicyagent.org"
})

allow := r {
    r := foo with is_object as http.send
}
```

Both built-in functions and user provided (i.e. custom) functions are mockable using this construct.

In addition to `http.send`, the `opa.runtime` built-in function is commonly considered unsafe in integrations where policy provided by untrusted parties is evaluated, as it risks exposing configuration, or environment variables, potentially carrying sensitive information.

#### Affected Users

**All of these conditions have to be met** to create an adverse effect:

* Use the Go API for policy evaluation (not the OPA server, or the Go SDK)
* Make use of the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` method in order to deny certain built-in functions, like e.g. `http.send`, from being used in policy evaluation.
* Allow policy evaluation of policies provided by untrusted parties.
* The policies evaluated include the `with` keyword to rewrite/mock a built-in, or custom, function to that of another built-in function, such as `http.send`.

**Additionally, the OPA Query API** is affected:

* If the OPA [Query API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/#query-api) is exposed to the public, and it is relied on `http.send` to be unavailable in that context. Exposing the OPA API to the public without proper [authentication and authorization](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization) in place is generally advised against.

### Patches

v0.43.1, v0.44.0

### Workarounds

The `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function has been considered deprecated since the introduction of the [capabilities](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/deployments/#capabilities) feature in OPA v0.23.0 . While the function was commented as deprecated, the format of the comment was however not following the [convention](https://zchee.github.io/golang-wiki/Deprecated/) for deprecated functions, and might not have been picked up by tooling like editors. This has now been fixed. Users are still encouraged to use the capabilities feature over the deprecated `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function.

**If you cannot upgrade**, consider using capabilities instead:

Code like this using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/ast` package:

```
// VULNERABLE with OPA <= 0.43.0
unsafeBuiltins := map[string]struct{}{
	ast.HTTPSend.Name: struct{}{},
}
compiler := ast.NewCompiler().WithUnsafeBuiltins(unsafeBuiltins)
```

needs to be changed to this:

```
caps := ast.CapabilitiesForThisVersion()
var j int
for i, bi := range caps.Builtins {
	if bi.Name == ast.HTTPSend.Name {
		j = i
		break
	}
}
caps.Builtins[j] = caps.Builtins[len(caps.Builtins)-1] // put last element into position j
caps.Builtins = caps.Builtins[:len(caps.Builtins)-1]   // truncate slice

compiler := ast.NewCompiler().WithCapabilities(caps)
```

When using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package:

```
// VULNERABLE with OPA <= 0.43.0
r := rego.New(
	// other options omitted
	rego.UnsafeBuiltins(map[string]struct{}{ast.HTTPSend.Name: struct{}{}}),
)
```

needs to be changed to

```
r := rego.New(
	// other options omitted
	rego.Capabilities(caps),
)
```

with `caps` defined above.

Note that in the process, some error messages will change: `http.send` in this example will no longer be "unsafe" and thus forbidden, but it will simply become an "unknown function".

[`196c92d`](/open-policy-agent/opa/commit/196c92df8b936e0b211b2d2ac767cbb89949060f)

This is a security release fixing the following vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2022-36085](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr "CVE-2022-36085"): Respect unsafeBuiltinMap for 'with' replacements in the compiler

  See [GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/security/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr "GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr") for all details.
* [CVE-2022-27664](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-69cg-p879-7622 "CVE-2022-27664") and [CVE-2022-32190](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q856-gh5w-3vwg "CVE-2022-32190").

  Fixed by updating the Go version used in our builds to 1.18.6,

  see <https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/x49AQzIVX-s>.

  Note that [CVE-2022-32190](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q856-gh5w-3vwg "CVE-2022-32190") is most likely not relevant for OPA's usage of net/url.

  But since these CVEs tend to come up in security assessment tooling regardless,

  it's better to get it out of the way.

```
The changes are necessary for both the Compiler and the QueryCompiler. Tests
have been added to ensure that the code path through the rego package has also
been fixed.

Fixes [CVE-2022-36085](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f524-rf33-2jjr "CVE-2022-36085").

With this change, we're able to mock built-in functions in tests 🎉

```
package test

import future.keywords.in

allow {
	payload.owner == input.name
}

claims[k] = v {
	resp := http.send({"method": "GET", "body": input}).body
	some k, v in resp
}

payload = p {
	some p
	[true, _, p] = io.jwt.decode_verify(claims.jwt, {"cert": data.verification.cert, "iss": "issuer"})
}

pass_resp = {"body": {"jwt": "myjot"}}

deny_resp = {"body"}

mock_http_send(req) = pass_resp {
	req.body.name == "alice"
} else = deny_resp {
	true
}

mock_decode_verify("myjot", _) = [true, {}, {"owner": "alice"}]

test_allow {
	allow with data.verification.cert as "cert"
		with input.name as "alice"
		with http.send as mock_http_send
		with io.jwt.decode_verify as mock_decode_verify
}
```

⚠️ Mocking user-defined (rego) functions is the next slice of work 🚧

Fixes part of [#4449](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues/4449)

So in the `not` + partial code path, the "disable inlining of the replacement func" trick won't work.

Since it's inlined, it should not be here. But I think for consistency, I'll try *not inlining* it here, either.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This looks great--it feels very close. Left a few comments on the implementation and test cases. It would be nice to get the docs updates written up and included in this PR--it'll be important to explain the scoping in that section in the language guide.

Sorry, something went wrong.

💭 could imagine using a pure built-in as the source here to avoid test flakes in the future.

Yeah... but we don't have that many arity-0 built-ins. It's only time.now\_ns() and opa.runtime(); since mocking rego.metadata.\*() is forbidden. We could add a test-only-builtin, but that could be a burden for any other users of the test data corpus.

But I'll fix those arity-n (n > 0) cases you've commented on below 👍

This way, we're comparing function signatures of built-ins and non-built-ins
where we've already gathered them: during type checking.

Note that this doesn't introduce first-class functions as a completely new
concept, but technically, we're passing around functions as first-class
entities in the `with` replacements. So we better check them as such, too.

The changes to the ast/check.go code are covered by the existing cases, and
the added ones, in ast/compile_test.go.

With this change, we can replace calls to built-in functions via `with`. The replacement
can either be a value -- which will be used as the return value for every call to the
mocked built-in -- or a reference to a non-built-in function -- when the results need
to depend on the call's arguments.

Compiler, topdown, and planner have been adapted in this change. The included
docs changes describe the replacement options further.

Fixes first part of #4449. (Missing are non-built-in functions as mock targets.)

Follow-up to #4540

We can now mock functions that are user-defined:

    package test

    f(_) = 1 {
        input.x = \"x\"
    }
    p = y {
        y := f(1) with f as 2
    }

...following the same scoping rules as laid out for built-in mocks.
The replacement can be a value (replacing all calls), or a built-in,
or another non-built-in function.

Also addresses bugs in the previous slice:
* topdown/evalCall: account for empty rules result from indexer
* topdown/eval: capture value replacement in PE could panic

Note: in PE, we now drop 'with' for function mocks of any kind:

These are always fully replaced in the saved support modules, so
this should be OK.

When keeping them, we'd also have to either copy the existing definitions
into the support module; or create a function stub in it.

Fixes #4449.

cmd/capabilities: expose capabilities through CLI (#4588)

There is a new command argument \"capabilities\". With this, it is
possible to print the current capabilities version, show all
capabilities versions & print any capabilities version, without the need
of a file. Moreover, for the other commands which use the --capabilities
flag, it is possible to give only the version number, without specifying
a file. However, there are no breaking changes for those who use the
capabilities file as an input for the flag. Unit tests were also
written, in order to test the new argument and the changes made in ast.

```
$ opa eval -p -fsource 'time.clock(input.x)==time.clock(input.y)'
# Query 1
time.clock(time.clock(input.x), input.y)
```

Now, we get the proper answer: `time.clock(input.y, time.clock(input.x))`.

Note that it's a _display_ issue; the JSON output of PE has not been affected.

status: Remove activeRevision label on all but one metric (#4600)

Having one activeRevision label on each of the prometheus metrics emitted
by the status plugin has proven to be problematic with a large number of
bundles. So with this change,

1. we keep the activeRevision label (just on) the last_success_bundle_activation metric.
2. the gauge gets reset, so we only keep the last active_revision (instead of keeping
   them all and therefore avoiding the situation where the /metrics output grows indefinitely)

There are no default prefixes in IPv6, so if an IPv6 without a prefix is fed into
net.cidr_merge, we'll return a non-halt error now.

Before, we'd fail in various ways if a prefix-less IPv6 was fed into
`net.cidr_merge`. With only one, we'd return `[ \"<nil>\" ]`, with two,
we'd panic.

bundle/status: Include bundle type in status information

OPA has support for Delta Bundles. The status object already
contains valuable information such as last activation timestamp but
does not specify if the bundle was a canonical snapshot or delta.

This change updates the bundle.Status object to include the
bundle type string: either \"snapshot\" or \"delta\". This can be useful
for status endpoints to differentiate between the bundle types.

ast+topdown+planner: allow for mocking built-in functions via "with" ([open-policy-agent#4540](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540))

With this change, we can replace calls to built-in functions via `with`. The replacement
can either be a value -- which will be used as the return value for every call to the
mocked built-in -- or a reference to a non-built-in function -- when the results need
to depend on the call's arguments.

Compiler, topdown, and planner have been adapted in this change. The included
docs changes describe the replacement options further.

There is a new command argument "capabilities". With this, it is

capabilities versions & print any capabilities version, without the need
of a file. Moreover, for the other commands which use the --capabilities
flag, it is possible to give only the version number, without specifying
a file. However, there are no breaking changes for those who use the
capabilities file as an input for the flag. Unit tests were also
written, in order to test the new argument and the changes made in ast.

status: Remove activeRevision label on all but one metric ([open-policy-agent#4600](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4600))

Having one activeRevision label on each of the prometheus metrics emitted
by the status plugin has proven to be problematic with a large number of
bundles. So with this change,

1. we keep the activeRevision label (just on) the last_success_bundle_activation metric.
2. the gauge gets reset, so we only keep the last active_revision (instead of keeping
   them all and therefore avoiding the situation where the /metrics output grows indefinitely)

bundle/status: Include bundle type in status information

OPA has support for Delta Bundles. The status object already
contains valuable information such as last activation timestamp but
does not specify if the bundle was a canonical snapshot or delta.

This change updates the bundle.Status object to include the
bundle type string: either "snapshot" or "delta". This can be useful
for status endpoints to differentiate between the bundle types.

ast+topdown+planner: replacement of non-built-in functions via 'with' ([open-policy-agent#4616](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4616))

Follow-up to [open-policy-agent#4540](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4540)

We can now mock functions that are user-defined:

    package test

    f(_) = 1 {
        input.x = "x"
    }
    p = y {
        y := f(1) with f as 2
    }

...following the same scoping rules as laid out for built-in mocks.
The replacement can be a value (replacing all calls), or a built-in,
or another non-built-in function.

Also addresses bugs in the previous slice:
* topdown/evalCall: account for empty rules result from indexer
* topdown/eval: capture value replacement in PE could panic

Note: in PE, we now drop 'with' for function mocks of any kind:

These are always fully replaced in the saved support modules, so
this should be OK.

When keeping them, we'd also have to either copy the existing definitions
into the support module; or create a function stub in it.

build(deps): github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go 0.35.0 -> 0.36.0 ([open-policy-agent#4652](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4652))

* build(deps): bump wasmtime-go: 0.35.0 -> 0.36.0
* internal/wasm: adapt to using epoch-based interruption

Looks like we don't get frames for this.

Also, there is currentlty no better way than comparing the message,
as the trap code isn't surfaced (yet).

# This is the commit message [open-policy-agent#37](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/37):

topdown: Add units.parse builtin ([open-policy-agent#4676](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/4676))

This function works on all base decimal and binary SI units of the set:

    m, K/Ki, M/Mi, G/Gi, T/Ti, P/Pi, and E/Ei

Note: Unlike `units.parse_bytes`, this function is case sensitive.

The changes are necessary for both the Compiler and the QueryCompiler. Tests
have been added to ensure that the code path through the rego package has also
been fixed.

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.

OPA is proud to be a graduated project in the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) landscape. For details read the CNCF [announcement](https://www.cncf.io/announcements/2021/02/04/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-open-policy-agent-graduation/).

## Get started with OPA

* Write your first Rego policy with the [Rego Playground](https://play.openpolicyagent.org) or use it to share your work with others for feedback and support. Have a look at the [Access Control examples](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/?example-group=access-control) if you're not sure where to start.
* Install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tsandall.opa) to get started locally with live diagnostics, debugging and formatting. See [Editor and IDE Support](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/edge/editor-and-ide-support/) for other supported editors.
* Go to the [OPA Documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) to
  learn about the Rego language as well as how to deploy and integrate OPA.
* Check out the learning resources in the [Learning Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/learning-rego/) section of the ecosystem directory.
* Follow the [Running OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#running-opa) instructions to get started with the OPA CLI locally.
* See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpolicyagent/opa/tags/) for container images and the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/releases) for binaries.
* Check out the [OPA Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16QV6gvLDOV3I0_guPC3_19g6jHkEg3X9xqMYgtoCKrs/edit?usp=sharing) to see a high-level snapshot of OPA features in-progress and planned.

## Want to talk about OPA or get support?

* Join the [OPA Slack](https://slack.openpolicyagent.org) to talk to other OPA users and maintainers. See `#help` for support.
* Check out the [Community Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/open-policy-agent/discussions) to ask questions.

## Interested to learn what others are doing with OPA?

* Browse community projects on the [OPA Ecosystem Directory](http://openpolicyagent.org/ecosystem/) - don't forget to [list your own](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/tree/main/docs#opa-ecosystem)!
* Check out the [ADOPTERS.md](/open-policy-agent/opa/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md) file for a list of production adopters. Does your organization use OPA in production? Support the OPA project by submitting a PR to add your organization to the list with a short description of your OPA use cases!

## Want to integrate OPA?

* See the high-level [Go SDK](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/#integrating-with-the-go-sdk) or the low-level Go API
  [![GoDoc](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f6efaab6e22452651b6ec572cdc002ccf812bbebcc000bf3c59ec109271fd5bc/68747470733a2f2f676f646f632e6f72672f6769746875622e636f6d2f6f70656e2d706f6c6963792d6167656e742f6f70613f7374617475732e737667)](https://godoc.org/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego)
  to integrate OPA with services written in Go.
* See the [REST API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/rest-api.html)
  reference to integrate OPA with services written in other languages.
* See the [integration docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/integration/) for more options.

## Want to contribute to OPA?

* Read the [Contributing Guide](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/contributing/) to learn how to make your first contribution.
* Use [#contributors](https://openpolicyagent.slack.com/archives/C02L1TLPN59) in Slack to talk to other contributors and OPA maintainers.
* File a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/issues) to request features or report bugs.

## How does OPA work?

OPA gives you a high-level declarative language to author and enforce policies
across your stack.

With OPA, you define *rules* that govern how your system should behave. These
rules exist to answer questions like:

* Can user X call operation Y on resource Z?
* What clusters should workload W be deployed to?
* What tags must be set on resource R before it's created?

You integrate services with OPA so that these kinds of policy decisions do not
have to be *hardcoded* in your service. Services integrate with OPA by
executing *queries* when policy decisions are needed.

When you query OPA for a policy decision, OPA evaluates the rules and data
(which you give it) to produce an answer. The policy decision is sent back as
the result of the query.

For example, in a simple API authorization use case:

* You write rules that allow (or deny) access to your service APIs.
* Your service queries OPA when it receives API requests.
* OPA returns allow (or deny) decisions to your service.
* Your service *enforces* the decisions by accepting or rejecting requests accordingly.

For concrete examples of how to integrate OPA with systems like [Kubernetes](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/kubernetes-admission-control.html), [Terraform](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/terraform.html), [Docker](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/docker-authorization.html), [SSH](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/ssh-and-sudo-authorization.html), and more, see [openpolicyagent.org](https://www.openpolicyagent.org).

## Package

gomod

github.com/open-policy-agent/opa
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 0.40.0, < 0.43.1

## Patched versions

0.43.1

## Description

### Impact

The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe — and as such rejected — by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn’t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`.

The same method is exposed via `rego.UnsafeBuiltins` in the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package.

When provided e.g. the `http.send` built-in function to `WithUnsafeBuiltins`, the following policy would still compile, and call the `http.send` function with the arguments provided to the `is_object` function when evaluated:

```
package policy

foo := is_object({
    "method": "get",
    "url": "https://www.openpolicyagent.org"
})

allow := r {
    r := foo with is_object as http.send
}
```

Both built-in functions and user provided (i.e. custom) functions are mockable using this construct.

In addition to `http.send`, the `opa.runtime` built-in function is commonly considered unsafe in integrations where policy provided by untrusted parties is evaluated, as it risks exposing configuration, or environment variables, potentially carrying sensitive information.

#### Affected Users

**All of these conditions have to be met** to create an adverse effect:

* Use the Go API for policy evaluation (not the OPA server, or the Go SDK)
* Make use of the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` method in order to deny certain built-in functions, like e.g. `http.send`, from being used in policy evaluation.
* Allow policy evaluation of policies provided by untrusted parties.
* The policies evaluated include the `with` keyword to rewrite/mock a built-in, or custom, function to that of another built-in function, such as `http.send`.

**Additionally, the OPA Query API** is affected:

* If the OPA [Query API](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/rest-api/#query-api) is exposed to the public, and it is relied on `http.send` to be unavailable in that context. Exposing the OPA API to the public without proper [authentication and authorization](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/security/#authentication-and-authorization) in place is generally advised against.

### Patches

v0.43.1, v0.44.0

### Workarounds

The `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function has been considered deprecated since the introduction of the [capabilities](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/deployments/#capabilities) feature in OPA v0.23.0 . While the function was commented as deprecated, the format of the comment was however not following the [convention](https://zchee.github.io/golang-wiki/Deprecated/) for deprecated functions, and might not have been picked up by tooling like editors. This has now been fixed. Users are still encouraged to use the capabilities feature over the deprecated `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function.

**If you cannot upgrade**, consider using capabilities instead:

Code like this using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/ast` package:

```
// VULNERABLE with OPA <= 0.43.0
unsafeBuiltins := map[string]struct{}{
	ast.HTTPSend.Name: struct{}{},
}
compiler := ast.NewCompiler().WithUnsafeBuiltins(unsafeBuiltins)
```

needs to be changed to this:

```
caps := ast.CapabilitiesForThisVersion()
var j int
for i, bi := range caps.Builtins {
	if bi.Name == ast.HTTPSend.Name {
		j = i
		break
	}
}
caps.Builtins[j] = caps.Builtins[len(caps.Builtins)-1] // put last element into position j
caps.Builtins = caps.Builtins[:len(caps.Builtins)-1]   // truncate slice

compiler := ast.NewCompiler().WithCapabilities(caps)
```

When using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego` package:

```
// VULNERABLE with OPA <= 0.43.0
r := rego.New(
	// other options omitted
	rego.UnsafeBuiltins(map[string]struct{}{ast.HTTPSend.Name: struct{}{}}),
)
```

needs to be changed to

```
r := rego.New(
	// other options omitted
	rego.Capabilities(caps),
)
```

with `caps` defined above.

Note that in the process, some error messages will change: `http.send` in this example will no longer be "unsafe" and thus forbidden, but it will simply become an "unknown function".

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
