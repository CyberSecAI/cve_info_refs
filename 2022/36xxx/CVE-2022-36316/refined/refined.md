Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36316

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how the Performance API handles cross-origin redirects. Specifically, when a cross-origin resource was fetched with `mode: "cors"` and `credentials: "include"`, the Performance API would create a `PerformanceResourceTiming` entry if the resource did not redirect, but would not create one if it did redirect. This difference in behavior allowed an attacker to infer whether a cross-origin resource was redirecting or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is an information leak. The inconsistent behavior of the Performance API revealed information about the redirect status of a resource, which is not intended to be exposed cross-origin.
*   **Timing Side Channel:** While not explicitly stated as timing differences, the presence or absence of a PerformanceEntry based on whether a redirect occurred constitutes a type of timing side channel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Information Leakage (XS-Leak):** An attacker could use this information to probe the state of a user on a different domain. This could lead to a number of exploits depending on the specific application and information gained. For example, an attacker could potentially detect if a user is logged into a service, or detect specific user settings on the target site.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The attacker can infer private information about a user's interaction with other sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Page:** The attack is performed by embedding malicious JavaScript on a page controlled by the attacker. This script would use the `fetch` API to make requests to a target site.
*   **Performance API:** The attacker then utilizes the `Performance API` to check the entries created based on the fetches.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to serve JavaScript**: The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page with Javascript that performs `fetch` requests.
*   **Cross-origin context**: The attacker needs to perform the `fetch` requests to a different origin from the origin of their malicious script.
*   **Knowledge of Target URLs**: The attacker needs to know or be able to guess the target URLs.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `fetch` request must use `mode: "cors"` and `credentials: "include"`
*   Firefox does not generate Performance API entries for cross origin redirects prior to the fix.
*   The fix involves generating an *opaque* `PerformanceResourceTiming` entry for cross-origin redirects, to maintain the same behavior regardless of redirect status.
*  The issue also affects same-origin redirects, thus making it a more general privacy issue rather than just a cross-origin one.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that the behavior of not reporting entries for cross-origin redirects was not aligned with the Fetch specification. The fix brings Firefox's behavior in line with the specification.
*   The vulnerability is considered a low-severity security issue.
*   The issue is resolved in Firefox 103.
*   The vulnerability is related to a previous issue described in CVE-2022-29915, which also dealt with detecting cross-origin redirects using the Performance API.
