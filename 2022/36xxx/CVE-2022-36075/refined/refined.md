Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36075:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Nextcloud Files Access Control app where shared storage was being excluded from the access control wrapper. This caused a situation where access control rules were not being consistently applied when a folder was received as a share.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent application of access control rules due to the exclusion of shared storage.
- Information disclosure of file names within a shared folder even if the user has limited access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Users with limited access could view the names of files within the top level of a folder that they received as a share. This can lead to unwanted disclosure of data, but not the contents of the files themselves.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the network. A user with limited access to a shared folder can potentially see the names of files at the top level of the shared folder when access should have been restricted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user with limited access who receives a folder as a share.
- They must interact with the system by viewing the shared folder.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was resolved by including shared storage in the access control wrapper.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity with a CVSS score of 2.6.
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-548, which is related to information exposure through directory listing.
- The fix for the vulnerability is available in versions 1.12.2, 1.13.1, and 1.14.1 of the Nextcloud Files Access Control app.
