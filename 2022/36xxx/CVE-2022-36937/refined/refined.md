Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36937:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `stream_sock_server` and `stream_socket_client` functions in the HHVM stream extension. These functions, when provided with a URL starting with `tls://`, were previously allowing TLS 1.0 connections.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use of Insecure Protocol:** The core issue is the support for TLS 1.0, which is a deprecated and insecure protocol.
- **Lack of Protocol Enforcement:** The functions did not enforce the use of secure TLS versions, allowing potentially vulnerable connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Downgrade Attack:** An attacker could potentially force a connection to use the insecure TLS 1.0 protocol, making it vulnerable to various attacks like man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.
- **Compromised Confidentiality and Integrity:** Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of data confidentiality and integrity during transmission.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Connection:** An attacker would need to initiate a connection to the vulnerable server or client using a `tls://` URL.
- **Protocol Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially manipulate the initial handshake to force the use of TLS 1.0.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the capability to establish network connections with the HHVM server or client.
- **Active Interception (Potentially):** Depending on the nature of the attack, the attacker might need to be in a position to intercept and manipulate the network traffic.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in HHVM versions 4.172.1, 4.168.2, and 4.153.4, which now only permit newer TLS connections.
- The fix involved modifying `ssl-socket.cpp` to enforce newer TLS versions for `tls://` connections.
- Specifically, the code was changed from `smethod = TLSv1_client_method()` and `smethod = TLSv1_server_method()` to `smethod = TLS_client_method()` and `smethod = TLS_server_method()`.
