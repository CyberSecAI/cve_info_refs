Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36882:

**Root Cause:**

The Git Plugin's webhook endpoint at `/git/notifyCommit` can be accessed via GET requests without authentication. This lack of authentication, combined with the ability to specify a commit ID, leads to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The webhook endpoint does not require any authentication, allowing unauthenticated access.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The endpoint can be accessed via GET requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Missing Permission Check:** There is a lack of proper permission checks, which leads to information disclosure by revealing job names that the user should not have access to.
*   **Arbitrary Commit Checkout:** The endpoint accepts a `sha1` parameter which can be used to force jobs to checkout attacker-specified commit.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The endpoint provides information about jobs that were triggered or scheduled, even those that the user does not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Job Triggering:** Attackers can trigger builds for jobs configured with a specified Git repository.
*   **Arbitrary Commit Checkout:** Attackers can force jobs to checkout an arbitrary commit, potentially injecting malicious code.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain information about the existence of jobs configured with a given Git repository, including those they do not have access to.
*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can force a user's browser to send a crafted request, which can result in arbitrary job triggering or commit checkouts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** An attacker can send GET requests to the `/git/notifyCommit` endpoint.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can craft a malicious web page that forces a victim's browser to send a request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Git Repository URLs:** The attacker needs to know the URL of a Git repository used by a Jenkins job.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the Jenkins server.
*   **No authentication is required**.

**Additional Details:**

*   The Git Plugin version 4.11.4 addresses this vulnerability by requiring a `token` parameter for authorization, although GET requests are still allowed.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity.
