Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a reachable assertion failure within the `netwatch` process. This assertion failure occurs when the process receives a specially crafted network packet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Assertion failure: The code contains an assertion that is triggered by a crafted packet. When the assertion fails, the `netwatch` process crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit results in the crash of the `netwatch` process. This can lead to a disruption of network monitoring functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack vector is through network communication.
- Crafted Packet: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted packet to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated remote user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to send the crafted packet to the device running the vulnerable `netwatch` process.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was initially found in stable RouterOS version 6.46.2, and also existed in version 6.48.3. It was fixed in version 6.49.6.
- A crash dump of the vulnerable process is provided, including register values, loaded libraries and stack information.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021/03/01 and confirmed on 2021/03/18, with the CVE assigned later on 2022/08/27.
