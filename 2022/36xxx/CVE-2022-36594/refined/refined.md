The provided content discusses a SQL injection vulnerability in the `selectByIds` function of the `tk.mybatis` framework, specifically within the Mapper project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `selectByIds` function constructs a SQL query by concatenating user-supplied IDs directly into the SQL string without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: User-provided input is directly embedded into a SQL query without sanitization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the SQL logic.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker can retrieve all data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code (e.g., `1') or 1=1-- -`).

**Attack vectors:**
- The `ids` parameter of the `/gets` route can be manipulated by an attacker by sending specially crafted strings such as `1') or 1=1-- -`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the `/gets` endpoint of the application and control the value of the `ids` parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The issue was reported in a GitHub issue.
- The reporter suggests that the framework should use parameterized queries (using `#{}`) to construct the SQL statement to prevent the vulnerability.
- The developer suggests to validate the type of ID at the business layer but does not fix the underlying issue.
- The reporter also mentions that many developers may not validate the ID parameter, and this issue is not limited to this specific application.
