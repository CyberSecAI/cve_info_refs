Looks ok but:
1 on a ticket page font changed to very large
2 on a tickets page in a frontend not enouph columns, like example – author of ticket and priority.
3 in the dashbord impossible edit ticket priority and category. Also you can close ticket once and cant change it to open.
4 need to add approve box when deleting
