Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36081:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a path traversal issue. Specifically, the `list_wiki` function in `wiki.py` was vulnerable to path traversal when handling the `folderpath` argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-23):** The application did not properly validate or sanitize the `folderpath` parameter when listing files. It allowed an attacker to specify a path outside the intended wiki directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Enumeration:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to list files and directories outside of the intended wiki folder. This could include sensitive data, such as configuration files, source code, or other confidential information present on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   By sending a request to the `/list/path:folderpath` endpoint with a manipulated `folderpath`.
*   The attacker would need to be able to make HTTP requests to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is mentioned as needed, so it could likely be exploited without being logged in.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content also includes the fix for the vulnerability, which involved adding a check using `os.path.commonprefix` to ensure that the requested path stays within the designated wiki directory.
*   The affected versions are `< 1.7.0`, and the patched versions are `>= 1.7.1`.
