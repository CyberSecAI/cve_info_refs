Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36019:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing input validation check within the `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannel` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code did not verify that the `min` and `max` tensors, which define the quantization range, were of rank 1 (i.e., vectors) as expected for per-channel quantization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation on the rank of the `min` and `max` tensors provided to the `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannel` operation. It was assumed they would always be rank 1 tensors without any explicit checks.
*   **`CHECK` Fail:** When tensors of an unexpected rank are provided (other than rank 1), it triggers a `CHECK` fail, which leads to a program termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can craft specific input tensors with incorrect ranks for `min` or `max` in `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannel`, causing a `CHECK` fail and program termination. This leads to a denial of service, as the TensorFlow process crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves providing maliciously crafted tensors as input to a TensorFlow model that utilizes the `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannel` operation. Specifically, the tensors passed as `min` or `max` need to have rank other than 1.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Model Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to influence or control the input to a TensorFlow model or graph that includes the vulnerable `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannel` operation.
*   **Tensor Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to craft or modify tensors to have an invalid rank.

**Additional Details (from the Commit Log):**

*   The commit fixing this issue ([785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0)) adds explicit checks to validate that the `min` and `max` tensors are rank 1 tensors.
*   The commit also includes similar fixes for `QuantizedBiasAddOp`, `QuantizedInstanceNorm`, and `RequantizeOp` where input tensors for min and max values were not validated to be rank 0 (scalar).
*   The commit message states "The majority of these are just missing checks on min/max".
* The fix was backported to older versions of Tensorflow.
