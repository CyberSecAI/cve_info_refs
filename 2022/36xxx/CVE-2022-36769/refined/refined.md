- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A privileged user can upload malicious files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to the upload of JDBC drivers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Malicious file upload vulnerability which allows a privileged user to upload dangerous file types that are automatically processed by the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could upload malicious files which could then be automatically processed and potentially lead to further compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading malicious files via the product's interface, specifically related to JDBC drivers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a privileged user with the ability to upload JDBC drivers. This requires administrator or platform administration roles that have "Administer platform" or "Manage Configurations" permissions respectively.
