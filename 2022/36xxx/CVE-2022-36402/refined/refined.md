The provided content is related to CVE-2022-36402.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `vmwgfx` driver within the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow in `vmw_cmd_dx_set_shader_res` function within the `vmwgfx_execbuf.c` file.
- The `cmd->body.type - SVGA3D_SHADERTYPE_MIN` calculation leads to an integer overflow when `cmd->body.type` is 0. `SVGA3D_SHADERTYPE_MIN` is defined as 1. This overflow leads to a large positive value being used as a size, which causes an out-of-bounds write/read.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Kernel crash, leading to a denial-of-service (DOS).

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specific ioctl() calls to the `/dev/dri/renderD128` (or Dxxx) device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to read and write to the `/dev/dri/renderD128` device. On some distributions, this device is accessible by unprivileged users, meaning the vulnerability can be exploited by unprivileged users running on a VMware guest.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specific ioctl() commands to the device.
