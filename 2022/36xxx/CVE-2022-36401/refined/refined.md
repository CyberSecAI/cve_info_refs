- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TeraWallet â€“ For WooCommerce plugin does not properly implement CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could potentially lead to unauthorized changes or actions within the plugin's functionality.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a website that crafts a forged request to the vulnerable plugin endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and have a target user with an active session on the vulnerable website. The attacker does not require any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
