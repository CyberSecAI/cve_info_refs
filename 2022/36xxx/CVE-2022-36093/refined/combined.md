# Unauthorized User Registration Through the Distribution Wizard in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates

High

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-h5j3-5x63-p8jv
Sep 8, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 8.0RC1

## Patched versions

13.10.5, 14.3RC1

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

< 13.10.5, < 14.3RC1

13.10.5, 14.3RC1

## Description

### Impact

By passing a template of the distribution wizard to the xpart template, user accounts can be created even when user registration is disabled. This also circumvents any email verification. Before versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, this can also be exploited on a private wiki, thus potentially giving the attacker access to the wiki. Depending on the configured default rights of users, this could also give attackers write access to an otherwise read-only public wiki. Users can also be created when an external authentication system like LDAP is configured, but authentication fails unless the authentication system supports a bypass/local accounts are enabled in addition to the external authentication system.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10.5 and 14.3RC1.

### Workarounds

It is possible to replace `xpart.vm`, the entry point for this attack, by a patched version from the [patch](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/70c64c23f4404f33289458df2a08f7c4be022755) without updating XWiki.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

#### Description

**Steps to reproduce**

* Disable user registration by removing the register right for guest users
* Log out
* Go to <server>/xwiki/bin/view/XWiki/Admin?xpage=xpart&vm=distribution/firstadminuser.wiki&xwikiname=attacker\_view&register\_password=attacker\_view&register2\_password=attacker\_view

**Expected result**

Some error message.

**Actual result**

You are logged in with a new user "attacker\_view" and password "attacker\_view".

This also bypasses any email verification that is setup. Note that this attack can also be performed on a [fully private wiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Access%20Rights/#HPrivateWiki) using the login action similar to [~~XWIKI-19549~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19549 "Page content, object properties and title leak on fully private wiki with xpages on the login action") but this should be fixed as part of [~~XWIKI-19549~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-19549 "Page content, object properties and title leak on fully private wiki with xpages on the login action").

This issue reproduces on XWiki 8.0 (and current development versions). As XWiki 8.0 is the version where the exploited template has been added as part of [~~XWIKI-13013~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-13013 "Create and register a main wiki owner in the DW") so this should be the actual affects version. I assume that this issue does not affect installations using an external authentication system.

Note that while the template includes code to set the newly created user as owner of the current wiki, this only works if the wiki doesn't have an owner yet so the user shouldn't have any extra privileges compared to a regular user (but this is still bad in a public wiki where all users have write access and registration is disabled).
