Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36093:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `xpart.vm` template in XWiki, which allows rendering of arbitrary templates. By supplying a specific template designed for the distribution wizard (`distribution/firstadminuser.wiki`), an attacker can bypass user registration restrictions and create new user accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Template Rendering:** The `xpart.vm` template does not properly validate or restrict which templates it renders.
*   **Bypass of Registration Controls:** The vulnerability circumvents disabled user registration settings by directly using the distribution wizard template.
*   **Lack of Email Verification:** The attack bypasses any email verification steps configured for new user accounts.
*  **Privilege Escalation (Potential):**  While the user created is not an admin user (unless they are made the first admin of the wiki), they still get a user account. Additionally, if the default user rights in a public wiki grant write access, the created user will have write access, even if registration is disabled.
*   **Private Wiki Exploitation:** Before versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, this exploit could be used on private wikis to create a user with access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized User Account Creation:** Attackers can create arbitrary user accounts, even when user registration is disabled.
*   **Bypass of Email Verification:** Email verification checks are bypassed.
*   **Potential Access to Private Wikis:** (Prior to fixes in 14.2 and 13.10.4), attackers could gain access to private wikis.
*    **Data Integrity Compromise (potentially):** In cases where default user rights provide write access, attackers can modify content on public wikis.
*   **Circumvention of External Authentication:** While the primary exploit does not apply to external authentication systems, if local user accounts are also enabled, this vulnerability can be used to bypass external authentication and create local accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is carried out by sending a crafted request to the server.
*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `vm` parameter in a URL, specifying a malicious template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki instance.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `xpart.vm` template and the specific template for user creation (`distribution/firstadminuser.wiki`).
*  **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not require prior user account or administrative access.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions >= 8.0RC1 of XWiki.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in XWiki versions 13.10.5 and 14.3RC1.
*   A patch is available by modifying the `xpart.vm` file, as described in the linked commit (https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/70c64c23f4404f33289458df2a08f7c4be022755).
*   The Jira ticket (XWIKI-19558) provides further context, including steps to reproduce the issue.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "High" with a CVSS score of 8.5.

In summary, CVE-2022-36093 represents a significant vulnerability in XWiki, allowing attackers to bypass user registration restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access or modify data. The fix involves patching the `xpart.vm` template to prevent the rendering of arbitrary templates.
