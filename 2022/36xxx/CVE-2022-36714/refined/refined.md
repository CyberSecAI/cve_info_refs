The content provided describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Library Management System v1.0 by kingbhob02.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `lab.php` file, specifically the `Section` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates user-provided input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Exposure: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided payload demonstrates how to retrieve the database name.
- Potential for further attacks: Successful exploitation could allow attackers to modify or delete data, or even gain unauthorized access to the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/LMS/staff/lab.php` with a manipulated `Section` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to understand basic SQL syntax to craft malicious payloads.
