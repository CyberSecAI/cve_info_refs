Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36747:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content includes a GitHub Security Advisory page specifically for CVE-2022-36747.
   - The advisory clearly states that Razor v0.8.0 is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, which matches the description in the issue.
   - The provided Github issue also discusses the vulnerability in detail which confirms the relation.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the `uploadchannel()` function in `web/application/controllers/manage/product.php`.
   - The `$platform` variable from the POST request is directly incorporated into a SQL query within the `getchanbyplat()` function in `web/application/models/channelmodel.php` without sanitization or proper escaping.
   - This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code via the `platform` parameter.
   - Specifically, the attacker can use `UNION` statements to inject malicious data into the query results, which leads to the XSS.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of user-provided input before its inclusion in a SQL query.
   - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected SQL code allows the attacker to insert malicious JavaScript that is then reflected in the output because the output is not encoded.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable component, leading to:
        - Stealing cookies
        - Session hijacking
        - Redirecting to malicious websites
        - Defacing the web interface
   - The severity is categorized as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.1.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The attack is performed over a network.
   - **Web Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `uploadchannel()` function, where the vulnerable `$platform` parameter is injected via POST data.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
   - The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
   - User interaction is required as the malicious payload is triggered when the user's browser loads the crafted JSON data.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable File 1:** `web/application/controllers/manage/product.php`
    ```php
    //line 98
    function uploadchannel()
        {
            $platform = $_POST['platform'];
            $channel = $this->channel->getchanbyplat($platform);
            echo json_encode($channel);
        }
    ```
*   **Vulnerable File 2:** `razor/web/application/models/channelmodel.php`
    ```php
     function getchanbyplat($platform)
    //line 421
    function getchanbyplat($platform)
        {
            $userid=$this->common->getUserId();
            $sql="select * from  ".$this->db->dbprefix('channel')."  where active=1 and platform='$platform' and type='system' union
            select * from  ".$this->db->dbprefix('channel')."  where active=1 and platform='$platform' and type='user'and user_id=$userid";
            $query = $this->db->query($sql);
            if ($query!=null&&$query->num_rows()>0) {
                    return $query->result_array();
            }
              return null;
        }
    ```
*   **Example Payload:** `platform = 'something' UNION select '<script>alert(document.cookie)<\script>' AS '.'`
*   The XSS occurs because the response of this function `echo json_encode($channel);` is not encoded

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory notes that no package is listed and the affected/patched versions are unknown, meaning it affects the specific version `v0.8.0` and no patch was released.
*   The advisory includes references to the NVD entry, the GitHub issue, and a Gist that further discuss and confirm the vulnerability.
*   The Gist provides a concise explanation of the XSS vulnerability.
*  The identified vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious data injected into the SQL database is displayed on the vulnerable page.
