Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `<location>` parameter within the `file:<location>` command of the `mangadex-downloader` application. When `<location>` is a web URL (http or https), the application attempts to open and read the content of a local file path on the victim's machine if the content from the online file happens to match an existing local path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate the input provided to the `file:<location>` command, treating URLs as potential local file paths.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The application reads and discloses the content of arbitrary local files if the content of a given URL matches a file path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can potentially gain access to the contents of arbitrary files on the victim's computer.
*   **Information Leakage:** Sensitive data stored in accessible files may be exposed to an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`file:<location>` Command:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious URLs that, when processed by the `file:<location>` command, will force the application to read and potentially leak local file content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over Input:** The attacker must be able to control the URL provided to the `file:<location>` command. This could be achieved through manipulating user input or by providing specially crafted files containing malicious URLs.
*   **Knowledge of Local File Structure (Optional):**  While not strictly required, knowledge of the victim's local file system may aid the attacker in targeting specific files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The application reads files but does not execute them.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.2.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
*   The patch commit `439cc28` fixed the improper validation of `file:<location>` syntax.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) link further explains how to exploit the vulnerability.
