# Unauthorized file read in `file:<location>` command where `<location>` is web URL location

Moderate

[mansuf](/mansuf)
published
GHSA-r9x7-2xmr-v8fw
Sep 5, 2022

## Package

pip

mangadex-downloader
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 1.3.0, < 1.7.2

## Patched versions

>= 1.7.2

## Description

### Impact

When using `file:<location>` command and `<location>` is web URL location (http, https). mangadex-downloader will try to open and read a file in local disk if the content from online file is exist-as-a-file in victim computer

So far, the app only read the files and not execute it. But still, when someone reading your files without you knowing, it's very scary.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

<https://www.mansuf.link/unauthorized-file-read-in-mangadex-downloader-cve-2022-36082/>

### Workarounds

Unfortunately, there is no workarounds to make it safe from this issue. But i suggest you double check the url before proceed to download or update to latest version ( >= 1.7.2)

### Patches

Fixed in version 1.7.2.

Commit patch: [439cc28](https://github.com/mansuf/mangadex-downloader/commit/439cc2825198ebc12b3310c95c39a8c7710c9b42)

### Severity
