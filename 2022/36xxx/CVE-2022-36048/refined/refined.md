- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The Zulip server's image proxy (go-camo) can be bypassed by a crafted URL, causing the server to directly embed a remote image reference instead of proxying it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of remote image URLs allows for bypassing the image proxy, leading to direct embedding of external content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can infer the viewerâ€™s IP address and browser fingerprinting information, leading to potential privacy violations.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending crafted messages with malicious URLs that bypass the image proxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send messages within the Zulip system. The attacker requires low privileges to perform the attack.
