Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `xfrm_expand_policies` function in the xfrm (IPsec) subsystem of the Linux kernel.
- Specifically, a reference count of a policy (`pols[0]`) could be dropped twice due to an error handling path within the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free/Use-After-Free**:  The primary issue is that a reference count is dropped twice, which can lead to a use-after-free scenario.
- **Error Handling Issue:** The code doesn't correctly manage reference counts in the error handling path of `xfrm_expand_policies`. When `xfrm_expand_policies()` returns an error it can cause an double free via `xfrm_pols_put()`.
- **Illegal address access:** When `xfrm_policy_lookup` fails, an error pointer can be saved in `pols[0]`. This leads to `xfrm_pols_put` resolving an invalid address in `xfrm_bundle_lookup`'s error path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double free can lead to a crash or memory corruption, resulting in a denial-of-service condition on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability appears to be exploitable by a local user or process. It is not immediately clear if network access is required.
- **Specific Subsystem:** The exploit requires interaction with the xfrm subsystem, likely involving the creation or manipulation of IPsec policies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the xfrm subsystem to trigger the vulnerability. This likely involves having the ability to create or manipulate IPsec policies on the system.
- The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the flaw.

**Additional Notes from the provided diff:**

- The provided patch addresses the issue by setting `num_pols` to `0` in the error handling path of `xfrm_expand_policies()`, which prevents the double free condition by preventing the `xfrm_pols_put()` from decrementing the reference count on an already released policy.
- The patch also fixes the illegal memory access when `xfrm_policy_lookup` fails by setting `num_pols = 0;` when `pols[0]` is an error value.

In summary, CVE-2022-36879 is a double free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's xfrm subsystem that can lead to a denial-of-service by a local attacker, who can interact with the IPsec policies.
