- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Prototype pollution vulnerability due to special strings in key places within events.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `matrix-js-sdk` is vulnerable to prototype pollution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Events with malicious strings can disrupt or impede the `matrix-js-sdk` from functioning properly. This can lead to data processing issues and the corruption or exclusion of runtime data, potentially affecting the consumer's ability to process data safely.
- **Attack vectors:** Network. Events with special strings are sent over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific privileges or user interaction is required. An attacker needs to be able to send events with specific malicious strings within key places.
