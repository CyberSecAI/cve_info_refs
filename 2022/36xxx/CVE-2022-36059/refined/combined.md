# Prototype pollution in matrix-js-sdk

High

[dkasak](/dkasak)
published
GHSA-rfv9-x7hh-xc32
Mar 28, 2023

## Package

npm

matrix-js-sdk
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 19.4.0

## Patched versions

19.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Events sent with special strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data presented to the consumer.

### Patches

This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk 19.4.0.

### Workarounds

Redacting applicable events, waiting for the sync processor to store data, and restarting the client can often fix it. Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all storage will often fix most perceived issues.

In some cases, no workarounds are possible.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H
