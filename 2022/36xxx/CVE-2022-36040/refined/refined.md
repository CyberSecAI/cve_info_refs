Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36040:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `get_complex_object` function within `librz/bin/format/pyc/marshal.c` when handling Python bytecode (PYC) files. Specifically, this occurs when reading the string representation of numbers within complex objects. The vulnerability is located at lines 345 and 366 in the mentioned file

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The code allocates a buffer based on a size read from the input, but does not properly validate if the read size is within acceptable limits. It proceeds to read data into the buffer without checking for buffer overflows, resulting in a heap-based out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can craft a malicious PYC file that triggers the out-of-bounds write, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine when the user opens the file using the vulnerable software.
- Crash: The vulnerability can cause a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious PYC file: An attacker provides a specially crafted Python bytecode file to the vulnerable software.
- File parsing: The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of the malicious PYC file when the `get_complex_object` function is called.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PYC file to the vulnerable software. This can be achieved in various ways, such as tricking a user into opening the file or by leveraging a different vulnerability to place it on the target system.
- No special privileges are required, meaning that an unprivileged user could trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs when parsing complex number objects from PYC files. The size of the string representation of the complex numbers is read from the file, and then the string data is read into a buffer allocated using `malloc`.
- The specific lines where the out-of-bounds write occur are in `marshal.c:345` and `marshal.c:366`.
- The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing efforts.
- The vulnerability is fixed in rizin version 0.4.1.
- The fix involves checking if the size value used to read data is valid, thus preventing out-of-bounds reads or writes.
- The patch also includes adding `UT32_ADD_OVFCHK` which checks for overflow.
