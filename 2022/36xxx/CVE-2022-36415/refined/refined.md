- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Beyond Compare uninstaller attempts to load DLLs from the Windows Temp folder, which is writable by standard users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL hijacking vulnerability. The uninstaller does not validate the DLLs it loads, allowing it to load malicious DLLs from a user-controlled location.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If a standard user places malicious DLLs in "C:\Windows\Temp\", these DLLs will execute with SYSTEM privileges when the uninstaller is run, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor can place specially crafted DLL files in the Windows temp folder to be executed by the uninstaller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a standard user with the ability to write to the "C:\Windows\Temp\" folder. They also need to be able to trigger the execution of the uninstaller as a user with system privileges.
