| Hi there. I'm a security employee for a learning management system (LMS), and I found a kiosk escape issue/bug tested in SEB (v3.2.2) for Windows Home (10.0.19044) which allows a user in SEB to quit it without the quitting password. I'm a strong believer in coordinated vulnerability disclosure and I do not want to publish this issue in public (so people will take advantage of it). Do you have an email address where I can report it? |

| You're welcome :p Thank *you* for the fast response times as well. Perhaps it could be useful for organisations if you put the CVE in the v3.4.0 release notes over at <https://safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_release_notes_en.html> so they know they should update the SEB version. |

| Are you okay with it if make an HackTheBox machine oriented around the CVE? e.g. the player has to perform a virtual kiosk escape in SEB as a foothold technique. Below are the pro's and cons of it (if the box gets accepted by HTB) in my POV: The pro's:   * You may receive more bug reports as hundreds of hackers will take a look at SEB   The cons:   * Players will probably release an exploit for the CVE in their write-up for the machine   After submission it should take another 3 months before the box gets released, so hopefully enough institutions will have updated to SEB v3.4.0 .  Finally, sorry for keeping this closed issue alive for over a month :-) .  PS: The CVE just got CVSSv3 rated at 9.8 (very critical) by the US gov's <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36220>. They included a list of 41 vulnerable SEB versions FYI. |

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

**IMPORTANT: SEB 3.1 for Windows uses a different policy to decide if it can be reconfigured when a seb(s) URL is opened and a .seb config file downloaded:Â**When running in a secure session (a quit password is set in the currently active settings), SEB 3.1 cannot be reconfigured, even if it's using the persisted client settings. Earlier versions could always be reconfigured when using client settings. If you want to allow reconfiguring SEB by opening a seb(s) URL while running in a secure session, then you need to use the "Allow Reconfiguring" and "Reconfiguring Config URL" options in SEB Configuration Tool/Exam. For the same behavior as in previous versions, you can enable "Allow Reconfiguring" and set "Reconfiguring Config URL" to "\*" (wildcard symbol, meaning any seb(s) URL or download URL of a .seb config file is allowed to reconfigure SEB) in your SEB client settings. This policy settings for reconfiguring are already used by SEB for macOS and iOS.

#### **Version 3.0.1**

Safe Exam Browser for Windows version 3.0.1 contains a fix for the issues some users of SEB 3.0.0 observed specifically in BYOD environments. The new version should prevent that anti-malware software falsely identifies SEB 3.0 as malware (false-positive detection using heuristics and similar algorithms). In some cases this blocked the SEB Windows Service from setting, resetting and monitoring specific settings in the Windows Registry, and prevented SEB 3.0.0 from starting or from resetting the power options. Following a list of the most prominent new features and changes:

* Implemented new default behavior to bypass SEB service as default.
* Updated browser engine to version 81.3.100 (Chromium version 81.0.4044.138).
* Fixed issue with incorrect virtual machine detection.
* Fixed handling of spaces in configuration file paths.
* Fixed issue with favicon.
* Fixed audio / video playback not stopping when closing additional browser window.

#### **Version 3.0.0**

The next major version of Safe Exam Browser for Windows. SEB 3.x for Windows has been completely refactored and uses Chromium as integrated browser engine. However, SEB 3.0.0 does not yet provide the complete feature set of SEB 2.x (see below). Following a list of the most prominent new features and changes:

* New, embedded browser engine (Chromium Version 79.0.3945.130 for SEB 3.0.0).
* Dedicated builds for 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems.
* Supports kiosk mode switch when reconfiguring (e.g. from Create New Desktop to Disable Explorer Shell).
* Action Center (side menu) with same functionality as taskbar (i.e. access to applications and system controls).
* Lock Screen, which is activated if a prohibited application canât be terminated.
* Access to developer tools of browser engine (for web developers).
* Real-time access to SEB application log (e.g. to test features like the URL filter).
* New settings to control browser session (for SEB-Moodle Deeper Integration).
* Improved user interface with new features (e.g. thumbnails of open windows in task view [ALT+TAB]).
* Completely automated build system with unit tests.

SEB 3.0 does not yet support the following major features (compared to all features of version 2.4):

* Additional resources
* Spell checking dictionaries for browser
* Embedded SSL/TLS certificates and certificate pinning
* Private clipboard for browser engine
* WebRTC functionality (e.g. access to the webcam by web applications)

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#WindowsLegacy) version 2.4.1:

SEB 2.4.1 for Windows is a maintenance release, which can be used if the refactored, more modern version SEB 3.0.1 misses a feature you need. SEB 2.4.1 fixes an issue which was reported to happen when using the SEB-Moodle Deeper Integration (available by default in Moodle 3.9 and as plugin for Moodle 3.7 and 3.8).

* Fixed issue when the old browser window stayed open while reconfiguring with seb(s) link, together with the Firefox file open dialog. Should fix issues when using SEB-Moodle Deeper Integration.
* Implemented fix for VMware Windows Registry error: The Registry value for "Enable VMware Client Shade" will now only be set if the active configuration explicitly says so (see new setting in SEB Config Tool / Registry / "Set VMware configuration". Don't enable this setting if you are not running SEB in a VMware Horizon View virtual desktop.
* Added Zoom to list of prohibited applications. If you want to use Zoom together with SEB, you have to set its "Active" property to false (Applications / Prohibited Processes).
* Added expansion of environment variables in path of permitted processes. This allows to configure applications to run as permitted process, which need to be installed in subdirectories of the user directory, for example %AppData%.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#WindowsLegacy) version 2.4:

SEB 2.4 for Windows is the last feature update before we switch completely to SEB 3.x. It supports the Config Key and session cookie settings, compatible with the SEB-Moodle Deeper Integration, coming in Moodle 3.9.

* Config Key feature, hash checksum value to verify settings used by SEB. The Config Key can be generated automatically by a compatible exam system together with the SEB config to be used for an exam. All SEB versions supporting the Config Key generate the same key, as long as the same SEB config file is used.
* Implemented setting keys to control clearing cookies when starting/ending a session (examSessionClearCookiesOnStart / examSessionClearCookiesOnEnd). This can be used to keep users logged in (SEB started with client settings) after an exam session was started.
* Now TLS 1.2 is supported for downloading .seb files using sebs:// links.
* Added more default prohibited processes. As a reminder: You cannot remove these default prohibited processes (SEB Config Tool / Applications / Prohibited Processes), you can just deactivate them by unchecking the "Active" property.
* Private clipboard should now also work correctly with rich-text editors like TinyMCE (fixed double pasting of text).
* Fixed two minor issues regarding port and path filtering in URL filter.
* Fixed: SEB Client crashes when loading client settings which don't contain all key/values.
* Fixed wrong error message in case service fails to set registry values.
* Fixed an index out of range exception when starting additional resource with application.
* Renamed setting Security / "Enable screen capture / PrintScreen" to "Allow screen capture / PrintScreen".

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.3:

SEB 2.3 for Windows offers new features, which increase security and usability significantly.

* Implemented private clipboard (optional, see Security tab). When enabled, cut/copy/paste works only with content inside the SEB browser, the private clipboard doesn't accept content from other applications or tools.
* Added zooming of browser windows using the Ctrl +/- shortcuts.
* Now the option "Allow downloading and uploading files" is supported in SEB for Windows, downloading and uploading (only when the website is using standard form elements) files can be disabled with this option (Down-/Uploads tab).
* The dialog "Open File With... Safe Exam Browser" is no longer displayed unless the option "Open files after downloading" is enabled (Down-/Uploads tab).
* Enabled SpeechSynthesis API
* Fixed issue when opening a PDF with a link to be opened in a new browser window (target = \_blank or JavaScript open), a second, empty browser window was opened.

* Now it's possible to open an embedded PDF file (embedded Additional Resource) when starting a SEB session, instead of a Start URL.
* mailto: links are now being ignored.
* Fixed bug with last allowed application not starting and all started applications not closing when using SEB without browser.
* SEB now can connect to some servers which are using Basic Authentication.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.2.3:

Safe Exam Browser 2.2.3 for Windows is anÂ **important security update**Â for SEB 2.2.x and SEB 2.1.8.

* Fixed an issue when calculating the Browser Exam Key (BEK) on Windows set to Swedish and probably Turkish. A different BEK was calculated on Windows set to such languages since SEB 2.2 and the check for detecting additional (irregular) files in SEB's program directory displayed a warning in SEB 2.2.2.
* Added settings option to switch off detector for RDP/remote session (SEB Config Tool / Security / Allow screen sharing).
* Security improvements important mainly when running SEB on managed computers.
* The dialog "Open File With... Safe Exam Browser" is no longer displayed when downloading and opening .seb files.
* Closing the download dialog while loading a seb(s) link doesn't prevent further reconfiguring anymore.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.2.2:

Safe Exam Browser 2.2.2 for Windows is a maintenance update for SEB 2.2 and two bug fixes for SEB 2.2.1:

* Fixed an issue in calculating the Browser Exam Key (BEK) in the SEB Config Tool, which happens when the config file contains explicit or implicit seb2 filter rules (key whitelistURLFilter and/or urlFilterTrustedContent, not visible in Config Tool). As this filter rules could slightly differ (Windows/macOS escape characters) or the key urlFilterTrustedContent can be undefined (because it doesn't have a function if URL filtering isn't enabled) and they were not updated in any case before calculating the BEK, it could differ in the SEB Config Tool vs. SEB Client.
* Added a check for detecting additional files in SEB's program directory (which might have been left there when updating from an older SEB version) and displaying a warning in that case. Such left over files cause a wrong Browser Exam Key as well.
* Fixed an issue when en-US was always selected as spell checking language, even if not allowed in settings, when starting SEB first time or after the contents of the Firefox Profiles folder were removed.
* Added tool tips to Additional Resources tab in SEB Config Tool.

* Fixed Browser Exam Key (BEK) check wasn't working correctly with some exam systems (because a trailing slash "/" was removed from the URL used to hash the BEK)
* Fixed that SEB couldn't quit Firefox when starting.
* Changed ProcessWatchDog to distinguish processes by ID in order to detect new instances of Firefox (not seb2) being started.
* Prevent that SEB browser can be used to finish an exam if SafeExamBrowser.exe is terminated: The browser displays a red lock screen in this case, requiring to enter the quit/unlock password.
* Improved user ID (SID) Handling in Registry Service, including when Service tries to reset Registry settings after rebooting the machine.
* Extended SID handling to always try all available methods to retrieve a SID.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.2:

SEB 2.2 for Windows is a major update with new features and many improvements. This version is replacing the SEB 2.1.x branch, with which it is compatible with one important exception: If you defined URL filter rules in SEB 2.1.x for Windows, then you'll have to re-enter those in the 2.2 SEB Config Tool, following the new filter rule scheme. URL filter rules created and saved with SEB for macOS are already compatible with SEB 2.2 for Windows.

* With the powerful new feature "Additional Resources", you can configure SEB to access specific webpages, full or partial websites and documents securely and easily in exams.
* Additional Resources can be opened using icons in the SEB task bar (similar to permitted applications) or with hierarchical popup menus.
* External Additional Resources use the improved URL filter to only allow displaying specific webpages, documents or sections of websites.
* Additional Resources can be embedded into SEB configuration files. An exam administrator can add documents like PDF files and HTML documents.
* Even full HTML5 web apps can be added as embedded Additional Resources, so they can be used in a fully offline exam scenario.
* You could deploy SEB Config Files containing an HTML5/JavaScript exam player onto mobile devices and then perform an offline e-assessment. The commercial exam solution Inspera Assessment is already supporting this.
* Improved URL filter which allows to use simple filter rules to effectively allow specific web pages/sites/content and block all others.
* Improved, refactored browser engine based on Firefox 52 ESR. This is the last Firefox version compatible with the XUL browser engine application used in SEB. We are already working on the next generation of SEB for Windows, which will be using a Chromium based browser engine (but this SEB 3.x branch won't replace the current Firefox-based SEB before 2019).
* Improved blocking of third party applications and tools for screen sharing and screen recording.
* Now preventing SEB being run in a remote session (using Remote Desktop Connection or similar on an exam client).
* Improved stability when setting and resetting Windows Registry settings to disable options like Task Manager, Switch User, Sign out and Shut down (accessible with the Ctrl+Alt+Del shortcut) during the exam and re-enabling them when quitting SEB.
* Integrated secure viewer for PDF files.
* Added Audio Control Component to SEB task bar, which allows to increase/decrease and mute system audio volume. Audio can be muted or the audio level preset when starting SEB.
* SEB Config Files can now be loaded from servers using authentication (Basic, OAuth etc.) using seb(s):// links. Even indirect links (not containing the file name with the .seb extension, like for example sebs://example.com/download.php?id=2352) are possible. This allows to store a SEB exam settings file for example into the same Moodle course as the quiz. The login session is remembered, therefore students don't have to login twice in SEB if you start an exam using a seb(s):// link to a config file on an authenticated server. Note: Starting SEB by opening a seb(s):// linked config file from an authenticated server isn't supported in SEB for Windows 2.2 yet, such indirect seb(s) links can only be opened from inside SEB (for example from an exam portal/landing page).
* Added a page loading (network activity) indicator.
* Added a browser window toolbar, similar to SEB for macOS, with reload and back/forward buttons.
* Navigation in browser history (back/forward) can now be allowed/disabled separately for the exam and additional browser windows.
* The browser user agent string now reflects the operating system SEB is running on and allows a custom suffix string to be added.
* Added new asymmetric/symmetric encryption for config files using identity certificate for better performance when decrypting certificate encrypted config files.
* Fixed on-screen keyboard wasn't displayed in latest versions of Windows 10. Now "Tablet Mode" needs to be activated in the system when using SEB in its "Touch optimized" mode.
* Added spell checking dictionaries in addition to US English for Danish, English UK/Canada/Australia, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Swedish, Swedish (Finnland) (da, en-AU, en-GB, en-US, es-ES, fr-classic, pt-PT, sv, sv\_FI). Some dictionaries for other languages cannot be distributed together with SEB, because they are only available under a GPL license which isn't compatible with SEB's MPL license. Currently only incorrectly written words get underlined with the usual red dotted line. The spell checking language cannot be selected manually yet, the default language indicated by the web site (for example <html lang="en-UK">) is used for spell checking.
* Fixed performance issue with application switching mechanism (ALT+TAB) causing Windows to overlay its task switcher over the SEB one.
* Fixed and slightly changed functionality of setting “Download and open SEB Config Files”, which now also controls if SEB can be started with opening seb(s):// config links and .seb config files. The setting is now also respected when a .seb file is downloaded and opened inside of the running SEB.
* Now logging all SEB files which are used for generating the Browser Exam Key.
* Fixed that some dialogs (reconfiguring not allowed etc.) were not displayed in the foreground, but hidden behind the browser window and were only accessible using Alt+Tab.
* Changed Base16 encoding of SEB passwords to use lower case letters a-f (following web standards and macOS/iOS) instead of Microsofts non-standard upper case letters.
* Added "Allow reload in exam“, "Allow reload in additional window“, “Show reload warning in exam” and “Show reload warning in additional window” options to Config Tool / Browser.
* Localized also all UI strings in Win Forms in SEB Client to German.
* Now maximizing browser windows if their size is configured to be 100% width and height.
* Quit Link sometimes not exiting SEB: Also removing trailing slashes before comparing request URLs to the quit URL.
* Now trimming trailing slashes “/“ from URL before applying URL filter (this wasn't the case in SEB 2.1.x and could lead to incompatibilities to URL filter rules generated in SEB for macOS).
* Changed default settings for hooked keys ESC and right mouse key to enabled (true).
* Now passing system language locale correctly to web pages in browser.
* Added some Firefox settings to improve Service Worker support.
* Changed reload in seb2 from hard reload to soft reload (to not break Service Worker when offline).
* Removed SEB for macOS settings in Config Tool / Browser for new browser windows opened by JavaScript/Plugins.
* Added improved logging for the embedded browser. Note: The log path cannot be changed in exam settings, SEB now uses always the path (and log enable option) which is configured in client config.
* In the native HTML full screen mode, the SEB task bar is also hidden now. Please note: You have to enable the "Esc" key in SEB settings if full screen mode on your website can only be exit using the key (otherwise provide a button on the webpage!).
* Added "Firefox/xx" to the default browser user agent strings for better compatibility.
* In the "iPad" setting option for the user agent for touch/tablet mode, the default iPad user agent string can be edited in the Config Tool / Browser pane.
* Added new option to Config Tool / Config File pane to use old asymmetric-only encryption (for compatibility with SEB < 2.2).
* SEB now deletes the browser profile folder when updating SEB, to prevent problems with not updated, cached browser modules.
* SEB Registry Resetter now exits when a non-existing/wrong user name is entered.
* Added another method to find out the SID of the current user and send it to the SEBWindowsService. This is an addition to the username, because the translation from username to SID inside the Service sometimes fails.
* The desktop background picture is now also removed on PCs running Windows 7.
* If SEB cannot terminate or force quit prohibited applications (Config Tool / Applications / Prohibited Processes) because they are running with other user permissions, then the exam is blocked and SEB asks to enter the quit/restart password (which exam supervisors/supporters should know) to continue.

#####

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.8.1:

* Re-integrated the "Create New Desktop" kiosk mode and declared dpi-awareness to resolve mouse pointer offset.
* Adding strictly prohibited default processes (screen sharing and communication tools) unconditionally to settings, default prohibited browser processes only in Disable Explorer Shell kiosk mode. If you need to allow one of these processes, then just deselect the "Active" flag of that process in Applications/Prohibited Processes.
* Now removing prohibited default browser processes in SEB Config Tool conditionally (if admin user confirms) from settings when loading config file which has Create new desktop kiosk mode set or when switching to Create new desktop (in Security tab).
* Process monitoring is now always active if either of the two kiosk modes is set.
* Fixed a security issue, now checking if SEB windows use original filename as well.
* Fixed dialog for entering settings password (if displayed when starting SEB) had a wrong scale if the system DPI ratio was different than 100%.
* Added monitoring of Windows File Explorer to prevent rare cases when explorer.exe was restarted, the shortcuts Win+Tab and Win+D and "Sticky Keys" were working.
* Fixed that the wrong permitted process was automatically started (with autostart property set) when the SEB browser is deactivated.
* Fixed quitting SEB didn't quit some permitted processes like Acrobat Reader.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.7:

* Now adding list of prohibited (browser) processes automatically to all config files which SEB Client or SEB Config Tool opens, unless a prohibited process with the same name already exists. If you need to allow one of these processes, then just deselect the "Active" flag of that process in the list of prohibited processes.
* Automatically disabling Chrome notifications using a Registry setting.
* Added new settings sub-key originalName to permitted and prohibited processes.
* Improved detecting permitted and prohibited processes, file name extensions are now stripped from executable and original filenames before comparing to running processes.
* Fixed error when displaying which running processes must be terminated before starting exam.
* Added verification of original filename when allowing user to choose path to third-party application.
* Fixed bug caused by case-sensitive string comparison when allowing user to choose path to allowed application.
* Fixed bug for terminating permitted applications when quitting SEB.
* Fixed autostart error when using SEB 2.2 generated settings with SEB 2.1.7. If permitted process firefox.exe for SEB browser was contained in settings (because those were created in SEB 2.2), the permitted process following SEB/firefox.exe in the list of permitted processes was auto-started, even if that flag wasnât set.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.6:

* Removed "Create new desktop" kiosk mode which fixes the mouse offset problem introduced by the recent Windows Creators Update. The mouse cursor had an offset if the display scale factor was set to a different value than 100% and SEB was using the default "Create new desktop" kiosk mode. For compatibility with older SEB versions, you can still select this kiosk mode in the SEB Config Tool, but SEB 2.1.6 ignores this setting.
* Added support for HTML 5 webcam and microphone access with new SEB settings in SEB Config Tool / Browser / Browser security / Allow video capture (webcam) & Allow audio capture (microphone). New setting keys allowVideoCapture (in seb browser mapped to media.navigator.video.enabled) and allowAudioCapture (mapped to media.getusermedia.audiocapture.enabled), and set media.navigator.permission.disabled to true (prerequisite for video and audio capture to work in SEB, as the Firefox âallowâ alert is not being displayed in SEB).
* Now ignoring SEB/firefox.exe entry from permittedProcesses, which fixes error message when using SEB 2.2 generated settings with SEB 2.1.6.
* Improved compatibility with SEB 2.2 generated settings: Removing additionalResources from settings sent to browser.
* The SEB icon in the SEB task bar is now always leftmost, even if it isn't the first entry in the permittedProcesses setting.
* Fixed SEB doesn't doesn't finish starting up properly when it can't add some permitted applications (which have been removed but not properly uninstalled).
* Fixed again wrong Browser Exam Key calculation after update by really performing a major update (completely removing old version's files).
* Updated seb XUL browser application to current status.
* Set Gecko/Firefox setting "dom.serviceWorkers.enabled" to true.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.5:

* Fixed that for some third party applications new instances were started when clicking the icon in the task bar (instead switching to the window of the already running instance).
* Fixed: Already running instances of permitted applications were not quit when SEB starts and were accessible inside SEB. Also fixed this for prohibited applications.
* Fixed some config tool UI issues: Radio buttons for Zoom Page/Text and User Agent were sometimes not set properly after loading a new config file, main browser window size wasn't disabled when using full screen mode.
* Added Gecko setting for HTTP2 (network.http.spdy.enabled.http2) to XUL seb config file prefs.js. Currently not changing default true to false, despite some unconfirmed information that HTTP2 doesnât work in Gecko <= 48. Please let us know if you have a reproducible case where HTTP2 doesn't work with SEB 2.1.5.
* Added MIME type application/seb to the .seb file type which the installer registers.
* Fixed in Network/Filter: If editing a filter rule (block/allow), the Config Tool didn't save this edited rule when using commands Save, Save As, closing the Config Tool, Open Settings (with button, menu and drag-and-drop), Revert Settings to Default/Local Client/Last Opened, Use Current Settings to Edit Duplicate/Configure Client/Apply and Start SEB.
* In the following cases also added checking for unconfirmed passwords: Open Settings (with button, menu and drag-and-drop), Revert Settings to Default/Local Client/Last Opened, Use Current Settings to Edit Duplicate/Configure Client/Apply and Start SEB.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.4:

* Added all new setting options of SEB 2.1.2 for macOS to SEB Config Tool.
* Changed âRestart Exam Buttonâ title and icon to âBack to Start Buttonâ, added disclaimer about this function not logging out a previously logged in user.
* Added Gecko/Firefox setting "browser.display.use\_document\_fonts = 1", to allow pages to choose their own fonts.
* SEB now looks for X.509 identity certificates for decrypting an identity-encrypted config file also in the "Trusted People" store in the Windows Certificate Store (in addition to the default "Personal" store). On managed computers this allows to deploy the identity certificate to the "Local Machine/Trusted People" store when installing SEB in an administrator account. The certificate will then also be available in the "Current User/Trusted People" stores of all currently existing user accounts on that machine.
* The SEB installer doesn't create the %APPDATA%\SafeExamBrowser\ directory anymore when it wasn't existing. This was the reason that Windows Installer shortly started and "updated" the SEB installation when starting SEB the first time in another user account than the one where SEB was installed. Please note that if deploying SEB on managed computers, Windows Installer will start and install .NET 4.5 on a Windows 7 system which didn't had this .NET version installed yet and will require a restart. So make sure that when deploying SEB on Windows 7 computers, .NET 4.5 is also deployed.
* The SEB installer doesn't create a SEB shortcut on the desktop anymore. Users can start SEB directly from the Windows Start Menu / Windows Start Screen (a menu entry/tile for SEB is still created). As before, it can make sense to start SEB by opening a SEB config file or by opening a seb(s):// link from another web browser or mail application.
* Fixed that some permitted applications could not be immediately restarted after being quit.
* Fixed a problem which caused the Browser Exam Key to be different when SEB was updated from an older version than when it was installed freshly. SEB 2.1.4 can be updated from 2.1.1, 2.1.2 or 2.1.3. A direct update from SEB 2.1 might fail, so uninstall SEB 2.1 first using the Windows control panel before installing SEB 2.1.4.
* Fixed a problem when switching keyboards didn't work properly when using specific keyboard layouts (at least when running on Windows 10).
* Fixed: Registry Resetter didn't complain and just did nothing when an inexistent username has been typed in. Added additional output for debugging.
* Fixed a problem which caused SEB Windows Service to crash rarely.
* Fixed starting the socket server after closing already running processes. This way if an instance of the browser is already running, it gets closed before starting the socket server and an error about a blocked port does not appear.
* The installer now always performs a "major update", which guarantees all older files are replaced with the new ones.
* "Monitor Processes" is now always active when "Disable Explorer Shell" is selected as kiosk mode.
* Changed title of setting in Config Tool / Exams to "Use Browser Exam Key (send in HTTP header)" according to Mac version and moved checkbox up, to be the first setting in the Browser Exam Key group box. Disabling this setting also disables the Browser Exam Key text field now.
* Log SEB version in log file.
* Write log file directly after starting SEB. Logging initially starts in the standard log directory, even if settings define another log file path.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.3:

* Current versions of Internet Explorer, Edge and Windows 10 complained about an invalid signature of the SEB installer when downloading or starting it. Reason: Windows doesn't accept executables signed with code signing certificates using an insecure SHA-1 signature since a security update from January 12, 2016 (if the executable was signed using SHA-1 after this date). SEB is now signed with a new code signing certificate with a SHA-256 signature.
* Added support for system proxy settings (the existing option in SEB Config Tool / Network / Proxies is functional now).
* SEB Windows service didn't start properly on some machines (SID could not be determined using the user name), this should be fixed now. Please report if single users are still having problems with the SEB Windows Service (warning or error message when starting SEB): http://safeexambrowser.org/support
* Fixed URL of SEBWindowsServiceWCF to avoid collisions with other WCF services. This might have caused SEB influencing some other installed applications.
* Improved stability of resetting registry settings when SEB quits or is started/quit again after not being exited properly.
* Fixed wrong version number in SEB installer.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.2:

* Native HTML5 full screen mode is now supported. Please note: The SEB task bar (if enabled) is not hidden by this full screen mode. To be able to exit the full screen mode, the Esc key needs to be enabled in SEB settings. Alternatively the full screen view should contain a button to close it.
* Hardware accelaration is now activated in the SEB browser.
* Fixed problem not recognizing a quit URL if the quit link was not clicked by the user but the quit URL directly loaded on the website.
* Fixed problem (displaying an exception message) when selecting a network in the SEB Wi-Fi task bar control.
* Fixed cancel button in the dialog window for the restart exam button.
* The option "Monitor processes while SEB is running" in the Applications config tool tab cannot be altered when the kiosk mode "Disable Explorer Shell" is active, as process monitoring is always active in this kiosk mode.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.1.1:

* Safe Exam Browser 2.1.1 is fully compatible with Windows 10, there is no delay when starting up on Windows 10 anymore and Windows updates are paused correctly while SEB is running.
* Improvements in the touch optimized mode for Windows tablet computers, as better behavior when the on-screen keyboard is displayed and the web page scrolls a text field into the visible area or when moving the cursor in and between text fields.
  + Not hiding and showing onscreen keyboard again when clicking into text field (to move the text cursor to another position in the text).
  + Not hiding and showing onscreen keyboard again when clicking from one text field to another.
  + Fixed a bug which stopped the keyboard from being displayed.
* A new setting allows to switch off the on-screen keyboard manually or automatically when a hardware keyboard is connected.
* Added a sebs:// protocol (in addition to seb://), which forces the use of https for loading a .seb configuration file.
* Updated browser engine to XULRunner/Gecko (Firefox) 41.0.2.
* Improved logging feature, the log is now better readable.
* Added confirm restart exam dialog when quit/restart password is not set.
* Add alert if entering wrong quit/restart password for restart exam.
* Config Tool: Changed default setting for "Use SEB settings for..." as local client settings usually should be saved "for configuring client" (like that they are encrypted without having to enter a password).
* Changed default value for setting option "Use Start URL" for restart exam button to disabled (Exam tab): In default settings now the restart exam button isn't displayed.
* Fixed bug which caused options in the Windows Security Screen (Ctrl-Alt-Delete) not being restored after a reset/reboot.
* Fixed bug which caused SEB being opened multiple times by quickly double clicking more than once.
* Fixed bug in the show keyboard layout SEB task bar widget which couldn't switch to other keyboard layouts in Windows 7.
* Fixed bug in creating Browser Exam Key.
* Fixed touch exit didn't work properly when screen was rotated.
* Fixed message boxes were not displayed properly after rotating the screen.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_releases_en.html) version 2.1:

* New touch optimized mode for Windows tablet computers:
  + Larger buttons in the SEB task bar and in dialogs.
  + On-screen keyboard is displayed when the user touches a text field on a browser page or when SEB requires to enter a password.
  + New web pages open in full screen 'windows', switch between open pages with the open windows chooser popup menu invoked by touching the SEB icon in the SEB task bar.
  + Touch exit feature in case no SEB task bar is used: Swipe down from the upper screen edge.
* Added button in SEB task bar for reloading current web page and optional warning message for reloading web pages.
* Added button in SEB task bar for restarting the exam, which can be password protected. Exam supporters can use this button when problems with the exam occur, instead of having to quit and restart SEB.
* Added control in SEB task bar for switching installed keyboard layouts.
* Added display of current time in SEB task bar: This is for example helpful if you decide to ban personal watches in exams (because of smartwatches).
* The former app chooser (Alt-Tab) now shows all open windows (from SEB browser and permitted third party applications) rather than all running permitted applications. Fixed visual issues (scrollbars are no longer displayed, scaling properly considering display DPI etc.).
* Updated SEB browser engine XULRunner to version 38.0.6.

**SEB Config Tool** has been re-engineered and now allows comfortable editing and testing of SEB configuration files:

* When you start SEBConfigTool.exe, it loads the local client settings, which are saved at the path C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\SebClientSettings.seb.
* There are new functions for working with configuration files (Open, Save, Save As, Revert Settings to... Default Settings; Local Client Settings; Last Opened, Use Current Settings to... Edit Duplicate, Configure Client, Apply and Start SEB). These functions are accessible at any point when working in the SEB Config Tool with a new menu bar, with shortcuts or as buttons in the Config File tab.
* If you changed settings, the Config Tool will ask you to save unsaved changes before quitting or reverting to other settings.
* SEB Config Tool now supports opening .seb config files with drag-and-drop (into the window or onto the application's icon).

Renamed Appearance tab to **User Interface**:

* Added option "Touch optimized" to Browser view modes to switch on the tablet mode of SEB.
* Added option "Enable touch exit", when enabled SEB can be quit in touch optimized mode with a swipe down from the upper display edge (helpful, when the SEB task bar with the quit button is not used).
* Added settings group for SEB task bar for all new controls (see above).
* Task bar height in pixels can now be changed for high resolution displays (display DPI settings are now also taken in account, in touch optimized mode task bar is scaled up in addition).
* Added settings options for switching between zooming the full web page or just changing text sizes.
* Zooming can also be disabled optionally (not recommended in most exam scenarios because of accessibility).
* Added option to disable the browser spell check.
* Added setting option for new Mac-only feature "Allow dictionary lookup".

**Browser** tab in SEB Config Tool:

* Added settings to switch between default and custom browser user agent strings, separately for desktop and touch modes (and for SEB on Macs).
* In touch mode, there is also an option for an iPad user agent string, as many mobile optimized websites recognize this user agent, but not the Windows touch user agent.
* SEB now also adds its version number to the user agent string.
* Removed option "block when directing to a different server" for the option "Links in JavaScript/plug-ins" (Mac only feature).

**Exam** tab in SEB Config Tool:

* Restart exam button: Either check the "Use Start URL" option or enter a link to which the exam is redirected when the restart exam button is pressed. The restart exam button is displayed in the SEB task bar when either the "Use Start URL" option is selected or a link is entered.
* You can add a custom title and tool tip text, for example if the button/link doesn't restart the exam but redirects to some other specific page, submits the exam etc.
* You can select the option to protect the restart exam button with the quit/restart password. Exam support/invigilators could be told this password to be able to restart the exam if there is a problem.

**Applications/Permitted Processes** tab in SEB Config Tool:

* Added option "Monitor processes while SEB is running". If enabled, SEB prevents non-permitted processes to display any windows (including alerts, message boxes etc.) by hiding them immediately. If SEB cannot hide such a process (because it is running with the rights of another user, for example SYSTEM) SEB terminates it. For the "Disable Explorer Shell" kiosk mode (see Security tab), "Monitor processes..." should always be activated (which was implicitly the case in former SEB versions), but in SEB 2.1 you can (and should in most cases) use this feature also with the "Create new desktop" kiosk mode.
* Added button "Choose Application...". When you select a third party application which is permitted to run during the exam using this button, the parameters for executable and path are automatically set according to the selected executable (.exe) file, considering if and which path of that application is registered in Windows (usually no path or only a relative path to the Windows registered path of that application needs to be entered in the field for "Path").
* Added option "Icon in task bar" for permitted processes. Mainly useful for background processes (not requiring user interaction) which you want to autostart when SEB is run.
* Added option "Allow running in background". Permitted processes with this option set are allowed to already be running when starting SEB. In this case SEB doesn't ask the user if the process can be terminated before continuing to start SEB. Processes with the option "Allow running in background" don't have an icon in the SEB task bar. They can nevertheless have the option "Autostart" set, in this case SEB attempts to start the permitted process regardless if it was already running or not (and the option "Icon in task bar" is considered in this case). If you need some background process running together with SEB and this process might display some window or alert/message box, you have to add this process's executable to permitted processes with the option "Allow running in background" set, otherwise SEB will hide the window of the background process when "Monitor processes" is selected (or even terminate that process, in case it cannot be hidden).
* Improved handling of permitted processes and their open windows, when switching between them using the app/window chooser (Alt-Tab) or the icons of these permitted applications in the SEB task bar. Some applications (for example Adobe Acrobat or applications based on Java like Open Office or Eclipse) still need special settings in the Applications/Permitted Processes tab in SEB Config Tool in the fields "Window handling process" (the executable of the main process of that application) and "Identifier" (substring which is displayed in every window the application opens).

**Network/Filter** tab in SEB Config Tool:

* Added tables for Allow and Block URL filter rules.
* Added new option "Rules are regular expressions": If not enabled, then the rules can be formatted using the wildcard '\*', which stands for an arbitrary string of any length.

**Network/Certificates** tab in SEB Config Tool:

* Choose TLS/SSL certificate to embed into configuration... Here you can choose SSL server certificates which are stored in the Windows Certificate Store (if you have a certificate file, you first need to import it to the Windows Certificate Store, depending on the format you can just double click such a certificate file to invoke the Windows certificate import assistant). The certificates added to this table will be included into a .seb settings file when it is saved and used on the SEB clients which are started up with that .seb exam configuration. Users won't be presented a warning then when connecting to https servers with self-signed certificates and you don't need to distribute SSL certificates manually to the exam client computers.
* Choose identity to embed into configuration... You can also choose cryptographic identities stored in the Windows Certificate Store which are suitable for decrypting .seb files on SEB exam clients (X.509 certificates with RSA public key and associated private key). If you have a .p12 or .pfx certificate archive file, you first need to import it into the Windows Certificate Store (usually you can just double click such a certificate file to invoke the Windows certificate import assistant). When importing the .p12/.pfx identity file, the included private key must be marked as "exportable". The identities added to this table will be embedded into the .seb settings file. Use this feature for creating a .seb file for configuring a client and add the identity or identities you like to use for encrypting/decrypting .seb files for starting exams later. When opening this .seb file on your exam clients, the embedded identities will be imported into the Windows Certificate Store (or Keychain on Macs), so that they can be used for decrypting exam settings later. Please note that during this process the private keys imported into the Windows Certificate Store of the exam clients will be flagged as non-exportable for increased security.
* SEB now finds identities (and certificates) stored in the current user's and local machine Certificate Store.

**Network/Proxies** tab in SEB Config Tool:

* Now HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SOCKS proxies (without authentication) are supported when using the option "Use SEB proxy settings".
* The proxy host/domain bypass list is supported now.

**Installer**:

* The SEB installer now updates an existing SEB installation automatically, so an older SEB version doesn't need to be uninstalled first.
* Fixed installing SEB in an administrator (or other) account didn't set filetype for .seb config files correctly in another user account (double clicking a .seb file displayed a dialog to locate a SEB .msi installer file and only after that fixed the filetype binding for that account).
* Changed properties for SEBRegistryResetter shortcut to prevent it showing up in recently opened programs in the Windows 7 start menu.

**Further bugfixes:**

* Quit and settings password dialogs now have keyboard focus when they appear, so it's usually not necessary to click them first before starting to type.
* Fixed SEB browser sometimes wasn't closed quickly enough and then displayed an unnecessary "do you really want to quit" or quit password dialog.
* Fixed when opening a .seb file is canceled (Cancel button in password entry dialog), then SEB starts with only partially visible task bar stub on the upper left screen corner and freezes (cannot be quit).
* Fixed SEB was quit when loading a .seb file (by seb:// link) and user canceled entering settings password
* Fixed a security issue with the settings key browserURLSalt.
* Fixed asking for current or admin password in settings even though that is an empty string.
* Fixed a security issue where a .seb file for configuring client encrypted with an arbitrary password could reconfigure a client without having to enter the admin pw saved currently in SEB on that client. Now this is only possible after entering the current admin pw or by encrypting the new settings for configuring the client with that current admin pw.
* Fixed bugs when reconfiguring client settings, when admin pw differs in new and current settings and user is asked to enter the current admin pw.
* Fixed process name was not listed in dialog "Permitted Processes Are Already Running" and in the dialog when permitted process couldn't be found if it didn't had a title property: Now using executable in the case there's no title.
* Fixed SEB sometimes didn't exit completely when quitting.
* Fixed when loading a .seb file with entering settings password, selecting cancel results in SEB being quit.
* Fixed generating XULRunner seb URL filter whitelist string when the Start URL is not contained in a filter rule and fixed connection with web socket server is not possible when the content filter is active.

**Known issues in SEB 2.1 for Windows:**

* The on-screen keyboard does not appear automatically when clicking into some text input fields, for example some web rich text editors as used in Moodle for the free text question. Use the keyboard button in the SEB task bar in these cases to trigger the on-screen keyboard manually.
* In touch optimized mode, sometimes the on-screen keyboard stops being displayed. When this happens, SEB must be quit and the keyboard button in the Windows Explorer task bar needs to be clicked (then the keyboard appears). When closing the keyboard and restarting SEB, it is again being displayed inside SEB.
* Starting and reconfiguring SEB on Windows 10 takes much longer than usual.
* Disabling Windows Update while SEB is running does not work on Windows 10, it leads to a timeout (this is the reason for the delay when starting and reconfiguring SEB).
* When SEB is started twice (by quickly double clicking twice), Registry settings are messed up afterwards (options like Task Manager in the Windows Security Screen invoked with Ctrl-Alt-Del are no longer available). Use SEB Registry Resetter to fix this problem.
* Buttons for shutdown and restart are not hidden in the Windows 10 Security Screen (invoked with Ctrl-Alt-Del).

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_releases_en.html) version 2.0.3:

* Improves general stability and compatibility with some exam systems.
* Allows current versions of Flash to run with SEB in both kiosk modes correctly.
* Updated browser engine to XULRunner/Gecko (Firefox) 36.
* Now Flash, Java and JavaScript can be enabled/disabled.
* Downloads window now is not opened when a download is started. This was a security issue as it was possible to open the downloaded file's folder.
* Bug fixes include a rare keyboard bug, another bug which sometimes caused options in the Windows Security Screen (Ctrl-Alt-Delete) missing after quitting SEB and an exception error message when using the WiFi control in the task bar and the WiFi connection drops.
* SEB 2.0.3 can be used with the (currently experimental) [fault-tolerant mode Moodle quiz plugin](https://github.com/timhunt/moodle-quizaccess_offlinemode), which allows to continue quizzes even if the internet connection to the Moodle server fails.

Known issues in SEB 2.0.3 for Windows:

* **Always install SEB from a normal user account, not the administrator account** (in case you have several users on your Windows machine). There is a problem in the installer which prevents other (non-administrative) users to double-click .seb files if SEB was installed from the administrator account.
* The network filter feature has been reworked and will be fully available as by SEB 2.1. You can already use [SEB 2.0 for macOS](../macosx/mac_usermanual_v2_en.html#NetworkPaneFilterSection) to define rules for the new URL filter. Saved settings files will also work in SEB 2.0.3 for Windows.
* SEB 2.0.3 doesn't support embedding SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files yet.
* In SEB 2.0.3, the proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.
* **In the former version SEB 2.0.2** the communication with its background Windows service to trigger re-enabling options like shutdown, task manager, switch user etc. (which are also visible after pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del) sometimes failed when SEB was exiting. If those options (or some of them) are still not available before or after installing SEB 2.0.3, and running and quitting SEB or a reboot doesn't restore the options to the original values, you should use the [SebRegistryResetter](http://www.safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_usermanual_en.html#RegistryPane) to solve the problem by resitting those values to the Windows defaults.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0.2:

* Fixed keyboard freezes (no text entering possible after pressing Alt-Ctrl twice).
* Fixed bug when in some cases restoring Windows Registry settings for options in the Windows Security Screen (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Delete) failed, for example when SEB crashed or the PC was hard-reset while SEB was running.
* Added shortcuts to SEB Config Tool and SEB Registry Resetter to Windows 7 Start Menu programs folder.
* Added option "Enable Alt-Mousewheel" in SEB Config Tool -> Hooked keys, removed "Enable Alt-Ctrl".
* The built-in seb XULRunner browser now writes a browser log file (when "Enable logging" in Config Tool -> Security is selected), the path of this seb.log file can also be chosen there.
* Added check box "Use standard directory" for the log file Win path (Config Tool -> Security), this sets the AppData directory as location for the seb XULRunner browser seb.log log file.
* Added various setting options to match with final version of SEB 2.0 for macOS.
* New option "Download and open .seb config files" in Config Tool -> Down/Uploads.
* Added default .seb config file filename "SebClientSettings.seb" when opening and saving config files in Config File pane.
* Updated XULRunner version to 33.
* Added "Firefox/33.0 SEB" to the browser agent string because some web applications like for example "VMware Horizon View Web Access" didn't identify the SEB browser correctly.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Every new SEB version generates a different Browser Exam Key (as code and configuration option changes are reflected in the key, this is the idea of the request header check using this key together with compatible exam systems). If you want to use an existing exam configuration with SEB 2.0.2, you have to re-calculate the Browser Exam Key with SEB 2.0.2 and copy the new key to the quiz settings in your SEB compatible examination system (Moodle and ILIAS allow you to specify several keys in case you want to allow your examinees to use either SEB 2.0.1 or 2.0.2).

Known issues in SEB 2.0.2 for Windows:

* The network filter feature has been reworked and will be fully available as by SEB 2.1.
* SEB 2.0.2 doesn't support embedding SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files yet.
* In SEB 2.0.2, only HTTP and HTTPS proxies without authentication are supported when using the option "Use SEB proxy settings". The proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.
* Pressing Ctrl-Alt and some number key (which can be used on German/Swiss German/US International and other keyboards instead of the Alt Gr key) and possibly other key combinations lock the keyboard sometimes. It behaves like if the Ctrl key would constantly be held down, text entering isn't possible anymore.
* Sometimes the communication of SEB 2.0.2 with its background Windows service to trigger re-enabling options like shutdown, task manager, switch user etc. (which are also visible after pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del) fails when SEB is exiting. When those options (or some of them) are not available after quitting SEB (or if SEB crashed), then usually running and quitting SEB should restore them. After a reboot the options are also reset to the original values.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0.1:

* Added "Please Wait" loading screen when SEB is reconfigured or quit. This prevents Windows from telling that the application is not responding and asking users if they want to quit it.
* Fixes in certificate management in SEB Config Tool: Display SerialNumber if no FriendlyName is available in a certificate, fix in selecting the correct certificate when loading the .seb file.
* Added basic support for individual SEB proxy settings in .seb config files. In SEB Config Tool -> Network -> Proxies you can currently specify a proxy server address and port for HTTP and HTTPS, auto proxy discovery and automatic proxy configuration. Currently only HTTP and HTTPS proxies without proxy authentication are supported and the proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.
* Added new option in SEB Config Tool -> Browser -> "Remove profile" which deletes contents of the seb XULRunner embedded browser profile directory (cache, cookies, local browser storage etc.) when exiting SEB.
* In SEB installer removed second SEB shortcut from Windows Start Menu (left the one in Start Menu -> Programs Menu).
* Updated XULRunner version to 31.
* Fixed bug in SEB Config Tool which caused a crash if loading settings was aborted and then user started to entering settings manually.
* Now arguments for XULRunner can be specified containing Windows environment variables for paths (for example in Config Tool Applications -> Permitted Processes -> xulrunner.exe, new argument: -profile "%LOCALAPPDATA%\SafeExamBrowser\Profiles").
* Improved compatibility of .seb config file format with the upcoming SEB 2.0 RC/final release version for macOS.

Known issues in SEB 2.0.1 for Windows:

* In some cases, usually after pressing Alt-Ctrl twice, the keyboard seems to freeze (no text entering possible) in the SEB browser. Pressing Ctrl once more (or Alt-Tab or Windows-Tab) unfreezes it again. The new option to disable Ctrl-Alt doesn't solve the issue, it might even block unfreezing the keyboard.
* In some cases restoring Windows Registry settings for options in the Windows Security Screen (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Del) fails, for example when SEB crashes or the PC is hard-reset while SEB is running. Then you cannot use the Task Manager or even log off/shut down. Usually after restarting SEB or rebooting the machine those Registry settings should be restored, but because of a bug in SEB 2.0.1 this sometimes fails. Please use the tool [SebRegistryResetter.exe](http://www.safeexambrowser.org/windows/win_usermanual_en.html#RegistryPane) in those cases. This bug is fixed in SEB 2.1.
* The network filter feature isn't implemented yet in SEB 2.0.1, you cannot activate URL filtering. The functionality has been reworked and will be available as by SEB 2.1.
* SEB 2.0.1 doesn't support embedding SSL and encrypting identity certificates into .seb files yet.
* In SEB 2.0.1, only HTTP and HTTPS proxies without authentication are supported when using the option "Use SEB proxy settings". The proxy host/domain bypass list isn't utilized yet.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) final release version 2.0:

* Added tool tips to the SEB Config Tool.
* Added about SEB splash screen.
* Fixed option to disable the shade (menubar) for the new Horizon VMware Client.
* Minor bugfixes.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC6:

* Added optional WLAN control to the SEB task bar which allows to reconnect to WiFi networks which have previously been connected to (before using SEB), see settings pane Security -> Allow WLAN Control.

* SEB now pauses Windows Update and therefore prevents slowing down and sudden restarting of a machine during an exam.
* SEB now disables screen saver and idle sleep while SEB is running and hides the desktop wallpaper (in Windows 8).
* Java applications (like OpenOffice) can now be used as permitted processes, but require specific settings: The title of their main window must be defined in settings Applications pane in the field Permitted Processes -> Identifier (for example "OpenOffice Calc"), the required main executable in Permitted Processes -> Executable ("scalc.exe") and the process which is actually handling the main window in Permitted Processes -> Window Handling Process(es) ("soffice.bin"). For this example the executable path should be entered as "program" in Permitted Processes -> Path, as that is the relative path to the main executable from the OpenOffice main directory, which is registered in Windows App Paths.
* Added new kiosk mode "Disable Explorer Shell" (Security settings pane -> Kiosk Mode: Disable Explorer Shell) which doesn't rely on the "Create new Desktop" method and increases compatibility with screen recording proctoring software like ObserveIT.
* Added process monitoring for prohibited processes: Those will be closed when SEB is started up or when they start up while SEB is running.
* Improved stability and performance when starting, reconfiguring and quitting SEB and the build-in XULRunner seb browser component, which should reduce problems with the XULRunner seb profile folder being locked and producing error message that "seb is already running".
* The Quit button in SEB task bar is now hidden when "Allow user to quit SEB" is disabled.
* Changed default setting for Permitted Processes -> Allow user to select location of application to false.
* Tooltips in SEB task bar on the application icons are now always visible.
* Added Support for the new Horizon VMware Client to disable its shade (menubar).
* Removed SebWindowsToolkit with outdated Registry resetting batch files. Use SebRegistryResetter.exe in the SafeExamBrowser\SebWindowsServiceWCF directory instead ("Run as administrator" with right mouse button context menu, see RC5).
* Fixed bug when using browser in full screen mode, without SEB task bar and application chooser (Alt-Tab) which previously minimized the browser window.
* Various additional bug fixes.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC5:

* Completely re-engineered SEB Windows Service with improved stability for setting and resetting options in the Windows Security Screen (invoked by Ctrl-Alt-Del), like Task Manager. In case of a SEB crash or enforced reset of the machine, those options are reset to the values which were active before SEB was used. This happens when SEB is started again and quit properly, after a reboot, or when uninstalling SEB.

* Removed section "Outside SEB" in the Registry tab in SEB Config Tool, as SEB now remembers the settings which were active on the exam client computer before running SEB and resets them to the original values when exiting regularly. In case SEB would crash or the user would enforce a reset of the machine while SEB was running, these remembered values are used to restore the original Registry settings.
* Added a new command line tool SebRegistryResetter.exe which can be used to reset Registry values for the Windows Security Screen options in case the SEB Windows Service was damaged and can't be run anymore.
* SEB 2.0 RC5 now only needs the current .NET 4.5 framework (.NET 3.5 and 4.0 Full Profile don't need to be installed/activated anymore).
* Updated browser engine to XULRunner 28 (equivalent to Firefox 28).
* Changed the SEB profile directory to \Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\
* Fixed bugs when dealing with permitted processes/third party applications and their paths.
* When "allow user to select location of application" is enabled for a permitted process, now only an executable with the same name as the one defined in settings is accepted. Empty executable names in settings are also ignored now.
* Improved closing of permitted processes: Now SEB first tries to close processes gracefully. This should solve the problem XULRunner wasn't closed properly especially on Windows 8.1 and failed to restart (profile in use).
* Fixed a bug when loading a .seb file "for configuring a client" and the SEB admin password has been set to empty before.
* Fixed a bug when XULRunner didn't accept a quit password which was defined in the SEB Windows Config Tool.
* Fixed bugs in the SEB Config Tool, especially in the Permitted Processes tab. Deactivated some options which are not having any function in the current SEB version.
* SEB Config Tool now opens \Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\SafeExamBrowser\ as the default directory when opening or saving settings in the Config File pane.
* In the Appearance tab the main browser window size and position fields are deactivated when "Use full screen mode" is selected.
* Fixed bug in the SEB Config Tool Registry tab where the enable/disable check buttons didn't had any function.
* Fixed bug when switching between allowed applications in the SEB application chooser (Alt-Tab).
* Fixed bug when loading .seb file for configuring client and admin password was empty.
* Fixed bug which caused SEB Config Tool to crash because it tried to calculate a Browser Exam Key even though opening settings was canceled or loading the file failed.
* Browser Exam Key is now also calculated when reverting to default settings.
* All running applications are now minimized when SEB is started. This is useful when not using "Create new desktop" but "Kill explorer shell" (which is only recommended in managed environments and as a workaround when using third party software which isn't compatible with the "create new desktop" mode.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC4:

* Added an install condition which displays a dialog with instructions how to enable .NET 3.5 manually on systems where it is disabled. See https://sourceforge.net/p/seb/discussion/3704033/thread/d68de28a/?limit=25#37e8

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC3:

* Fixed problem when opening .seb files with spaces in the path/file name by double clicking didn't work.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC2:

* Added dealing with a possible race condition when opening .seb files by double clicking.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC build 2.0.5162.18136:

* SEB Config Tool is now contained in the SEB installer and is installed in the same directory like SafeExamBrowser.exe application (Program Files\SafeExamBrowser\SebWindowsConfig.exe).
* SEB Windows Client is now localized to German.
* Improved arrangement (layout) of widgets in General pane
* Fixed bug in Browser Exam Key generation in SEBProtection controller.
* Added .NET 4 (full profile) prerequisite to installer.

##### Release notes [Safe Exam Browser for Windows](../download_en.html#Windows) version 2.0RC:

Safe Exam Browser 2.0 is a completely re-engineered, modern .NET application, including new features, superior usability and improved stability.

Main features:

* Adds support for encrypted .seb setting files which allow to individually configure SEB per exam. The configuration is compatible with both the Windows and Mac version of SEB. Use the separate SEB Windows configuration tool to create .seb settings.
* Easier installation and initial configuration of a SEB client, which facilitates to use SEB for secure exams especially on unmanaged computers like students' own laptops, in BYOD scenarios.
* New feature to quit SEB after the exam is submitted by specifying a quit link and placing this on the summary page displayed by your LMS after submitting the exam.
* The Browser Exam Key allows an exam module to authenticate the connecting SEB version and its settings. For the learning management system Moodle a plug-in offering this functionality has been released, a plugin ILIAS will follow shortly (beta version available).
* New options in the user interface: Size and positioning of browser windows (main window with the quiz and additional browser windows) can be preset. The SEB main browser window can be displayed full screen or as a sizable and movable window.
* Permitted third party applications are easier to start up (autostart together with SEB and by clicking on its icon in the new SEB task bar).
* Prohibited processes and applications can be preset which are stopped when SEB starts up.
* PrintScreen can be blocked, the clipboard is cleaned when SEB is started and stopped. The Flash plugin is working again without workarounds.
* SebWindowsConfig.exe - SEB configuration editor for creating and modifying .seb settings files for Safe Exam Browser 2.0:
* Allows to define all options for the Windows and Mac versions of SEB 2.0.
* Can save .seb files for individual configuration per exam and per exam client, which are protected by strong encryption against manipulation.
* Configuration files can configure a SEB exam client to show for example a portal page with the current exams.
* Configuration files can be used to start an exam with individual configuration (like specific security and user interface options, permitted third party applications, Browser Exam Key for authenticating these settings and the SEB application to an exam server, Quit Link to close SEB automatically when an exam is submitted etc.).
* Supports .seb files encrypted with password or X.509 (public/private key cryptography) certificates. For debugging purposes .seb configuration files can be saved unencrypted in an human readable XML format.

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.9.1](../download_en.html#Windows):

* New installation program:
* Improved configuration program:
* New browser component:
* Bugfix: When SEB was prematurely quit or crashed, the Windows Registry values (for the blue *Windows Security Screen*) remained **changed** (e.g. the Task Manager was disabled also in normal use). Now the user can during configuration define the values not only for **inside** but also for **outside** of SEB. If something goes wrong during SEB operation and the registry values are out of tune, you simply start SEB once again and quit it using the **SEB exit sequence** (e.g. F3\_F11\_F6). This will reset the registry values to the normal ones,and the Task Manager will be available again.

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.8.2](../download_en.html#Windows):

* Bugfix: Reloading / Refreshing the current page in the browser window by pressing the F5 key did not work. Now it is possible, provided that the F5 key is admitted. The new default setting for the F5 key is therefore "enabled".

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.8.1](../download_en.html#Windows):

* Bugfix: Clicking on the SEB icon of the user's desktop in some cases launched the SEB installer rather than the actual SEB application. Now the SEB installer creates a shortcut to the SEB application on the **common** desktop. Thus the SEB icon and shortcut are visible to **all** users, and clicking on this icon launches the SEB application as intended.

* Bugfix: When finishing, SEB restored the **default** registry values for Task Manager etc. (on the blue *Windows Security Screen*). Now, SEB instead restores the **previous** registry values (= the values before SEB was started).

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.8](../download_en.html#Windows):

* Easens configuration for the teacher. It is now possible to do the configuration in a new GUI editor called *SebWindowsConfig.exe* using mouse clicks, without directly editing the initialisation files *SebStarter.ini* and *MsgHook.ini*.

* The file format of these ini files has been simplified and is now better human-readable.

* In addition to the full version of SEB (installation via .msi file), a classic portable version can be built (copying of a zip file without installation), which has less functionality.

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.7](../download_en.html#Windows):

* Easens configuration and deployment for the teacher. It is now possible to modify the configuration files before rather than after installation, so the students can directly install SEB without patching it by additional configuration files after installation. Also, an Administrative Install via network is now possible.

* Downloading a zip file, as in former SEB versions up to 1.4.1

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.6.1](../download_en.html#Windows):

* Multilingual (German, English, French menus and error messages) based upon the current user default input language.

* Improved abort behaviour when SEB fails to start (no zombie process "Seb.exe" anymore).

* XULRunner bugfix: problem when downloading a file and start a third-party application according to its file extension now works.

* SEB detects whether it is running on a virtual machine.

* New file locations for .ini and .log files match policy for modern Windows applications.

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.4.1](../download_en.html#Windows):

* XULRunner version. Fixes a bug regarding the logfile (SEB startup problem when LOGFILE=0 and logfile could not be created due to lack of write permission).

##### Release notes for [SEB Windows 1.3.4](../download_en.html#Windows):

* Portable Firefox version. Fixes a bug regarding the logfile (SEB startup problem when LOGFILE=0 and logfile could not be created due to lack of write permission).
