The provided content discusses the use of newline characters (\n) and null bytes (\0) as command separators in embedded systems and ASICs, specifically within the context of cryptocurrency ASIC miners. While it acknowledges the interchangeable use of these characters for certain attacks, it does not describe a specific vulnerability that is exploitable based on this behavior. The text mentions that "shell will treat null characters as command separators," but this is not necessarily a vulnerability by itself. The author is just explaining the behavior of some embedded shells on ASIC miners, not a weakness that leads to exploitation or any vulnerability related to CVE-2022-36604.

Based on the provided information, there is no vulnerability information or any indication of a vulnerability related to CVE-2022-36604, so the content is considered:
