The provided content relates to CVE-2022-36066.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper path sanitization during the decompression of zip and gzip tar archives. Specifically, the software was vulnerable to directory traversal attacks via crafted archive entries containing "../" sequences within filenames. This allowed malicious archives to write files to arbitrary locations outside of the intended destination directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper path sanitization of archive entries during decompression
- Directory traversal vulnerability due to lack of path validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file write: An attacker could write files to any location on the server's filesystem accessible by the application's process.
- Remote code execution: By writing malicious files (e.g., scripts, libraries) to specific locations, the attacker could gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted zip or gzip tar archives.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative privileges to upload files to the vulnerable application.
