{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `RaggedTensorToVariant` operation in TensorFlow does not properly validate the rank of tensors in the `rt_nested_splits` list, leading to a `CHECK` fail.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation allows tensors with ranks other than one to be passed to the `RaggedTensorToVariant` operation, which triggers a `CHECK` fail.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a denial of service (DoS) due to a `CHECK` fail.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a `rt_nested_splits` list containing tensors of ranks other than one to the `RaggedTensorToVariant` operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `RaggedTensorToVariant` operation, specifically the `rt_nested_splits` argument."
