The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Simple Task Scheduling System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `delete_category` function within the `Master.php` file. The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization on the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can extract database information, such as the database name.
- Potential for further attacks: Successful SQL injection can lead to further exploitation, including data manipulation, privilege escalation, and complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `delete_category` function with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.
- Vulnerable parameter: The `id` parameter within the `delete_category` function is the entry point for the attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs to have network access to the web server hosting the application.
- Understanding of SQL injection: The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
