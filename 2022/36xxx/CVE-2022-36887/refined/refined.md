```
  - Root cause of vulnerability: The Job Configuration History Plugin does not require POST requests for several HTTP endpoints.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can delete entries from the job, agent, and system configuration history, or restore older versions of these configurations.
  - Attack vectors: By making a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to trick a user with a valid Jenkins session into performing an action, which is typically achieved by getting the user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page.
