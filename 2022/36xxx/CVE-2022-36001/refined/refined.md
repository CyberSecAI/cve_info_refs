Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36001

**Root Cause:** The `DrawBoundingBoxes` operation in TensorFlow does not properly handle input `boxes` tensors that are not of the `float` data type.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Type confusion: The code incorrectly assumes the input `boxes` tensor to be of `float` type without proper validation, leading to a type mismatch.
- Missing input validation: Lack of proper input validation allows a non-float `boxes` tensor to be passed, leading to a `CHECK` fail.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The `CHECK` fail can cause the program to crash or terminate abnormally, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Passing a `boxes` tensor with a data type other than float to the `DrawBoundingBoxes` operation.
- The provided Python code demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by providing a `tf.half` tensor for the images and a `tf.float32` tensor for the boxes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the input to the `DrawBoundingBoxes` operation, specifically the data type of the `boxes` tensor. This implies the attacker needs to be able to influence the construction of a TensorFlow graph.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `da0d65cdc1270038e72157ba35bf74b85d9bda11` addresses the issue by explicitly setting the `boxes` tensor type to `float` in the `draw_bounding_box_op.cc` file.
- The vulnerability was reported by 刘力源, Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology.
- The vulnerability is rated as Low severity.
- Patched versions are 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0
- The issue affects `tensorflow`, `tensorflow-cpu`, and `tensorflow-gpu` packages.
- The GitHub security advisory link is: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/security/advisories/GHSA-jqm7-m5q7-3hm5
