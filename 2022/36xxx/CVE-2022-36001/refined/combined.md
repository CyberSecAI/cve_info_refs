# `CHECK` fail in `DrawBoundingBoxes`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-jqm7-m5q7-3hm5
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

When `DrawBoundingBoxes` receives an input `boxes` that is not of dtype `float`, it gives a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
arg_0=tf.constant(value=np.random.random(size=(1, 3, 2, 3)), shape=(1, 3, 2, 3), dtype=tf.half)
arg_1=tf.constant(value=np.random.random(size=(1, 2, 4)), shape=(1, 2, 4), dtype=tf.float32)
arg_2=''
tf.raw_ops.DrawBoundingBoxes(images=arg_0, boxes=arg_1, name=arg_2)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [da0d65cdc1270038e72157ba35bf74b85d9bda11](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/da0d65cdc1270038e72157ba35bf74b85d9bda11).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by 刘力源, Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-36001

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
