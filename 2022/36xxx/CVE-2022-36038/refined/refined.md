Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of `Oj.load` to process user-provided JSON payloads. The `Oj#load` method is unsafe for processing untrusted user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application was using `Oj.load`, which is known to be unsafe, to process JSON data from user input. This allowed attackers to craft malicious payloads that could be deserialized to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to send the malicious JSON payload.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was patched by replacing `Oj.load` with `Oj.safe_load`.
* The vulnerable code was located in `app/helpers/simulator_helper.rb`.
* The fix was introduced in commit `7b3023a99499a7675f10f2c1d9effdf10c35fb6e`.
* The advisory is identified as GHSA-8c8q-4h7g-4rp3.
* The severity of the vulnerability is rated as High.
