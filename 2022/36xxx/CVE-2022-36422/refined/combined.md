## Description

### Usage

1. Open `wp-content/themes/<YOUR THEME NAME>/index.php`
2. You may place it in archive.php, single.php, post.php or page.php also.
3. Find: `<?php while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>`
4. Add Anywhere Below It (The Place You Want The Ratings To Show): `<?php if(function_exists('the_ratings')) { the_ratings(); } ?>`

* If you DO NOT want the ratings to appear in every post/page, DO NOT use the code above. Just type in `[ratings]` into the selected post/page content and it will embed ratings into that post/page only.
* If you want to embed other post ratings use `[ratings id="1"]`, where 1 is the ID of the post/page ratings that you want to display.
* If you want to embed other post ratings results, use `[ratings id="1" results="true"]`, where 1 is the ID of the post/page ratings results that you want to display.

### [No Support!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/no-support-615/)

Seems that Lester Chan is not supporting this plugin. I am currently unable to update the plugin in WordPress without issues. He is not responsive. The plugin was also supposed to report the ratings to Google which is does not. Why does WP allow abandoned plugins to remain on their site? If the plugins are not supported by the developers they should be removed.

Very great plugin, so far it works very well and meets expectations. The only thing I have a problem with is getting comfortable with adding custom icons, preferably as a path to the icon directory in the site theme instead of in the plugin.
