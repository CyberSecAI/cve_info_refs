The provided content is related to the WordPress plugin "WP-PostRatings". There is a mention of a fix for an XSS vulnerability in the changelog.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Root Cause**: The changelog for version 1.91.2 mentions "FIXED: XSS in Google Rich Text Snippets". This indicates that user-supplied data related to Google Rich Text Snippets was not properly sanitized, leading to the possibility of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

- **Weaknesses:** The plugin was vulnerable to XSS due to inadequate sanitization of user input used in Google Rich Text Snippets.

- **Impact**: A successful XSS attack could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the browsers of users visiting the affected website. This could result in:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Stealing user cookies/session tokens
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of a user without their consent.

- **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the Google Rich Text Snippets functionality of the plugin. The attacker would need to inject malicious JavaScript code into a field that is not being sanitized before being included in the Rich Text Snippet output.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities**: An attacker would need the ability to influence the data that is being rendered in the Google Rich Text Snippets, this likely requires either administrator access, or some other means of injecting data through a vulnerable field of the plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The changelog also mentions "Version 1.83.2 - FIXED: Unauthenticated blind SQL injection in ratings_most_orderby()." which is a separate vulnerability.
