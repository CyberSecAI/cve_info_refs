Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the described vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the rolling code implementation used in many car keyless entry systems. These systems accept a sequence of valid keys as a "resync" code. This mechanism, intended to allow the key fob and car to re-establish synchronization, can be exploited to permanently unlock a vehicle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Flawed Resynchronization:** The core weakness is the use of a sequence of valid key codes to resynchronize the key fob and the car. This design allows an attacker to capture a series of valid codes and use them to reset the car's rolling code sequence.
*   **Time-Agnostic Replay:** Unlike traditional replay attacks which require the captured code to be replayed immediately, this attack is time-agnostic because the captured sequence can be used later to unlock the car.
*   **Lack of Robust Validation:** The vulnerability indicates a lack of proper validation or checks on the sequence of codes received by the vehicle to prevent such resynchronization exploits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Permanent Vehicle Unlocking:** An attacker can permanently unlock a vehicle without the need for further keyfob signal captures, as the car's rolling code sequence has been reset by the attacker.
*   **Vehicle Theft:** After unlocking the car, thieves can then easily steal the vehicle.
*   **Circumvention of Security:** The attack bypasses the intended security of rolling code systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Eavesdropping/Signal Capture:** The primary attack vector is intercepting and recording a sequence of valid keyfob transmissions. This can be achieved through various methods, including:
    *   Jamming and Recording: Jamming the signal between the keyfob and car forces the user to press the key multiple times, allowing multiple codes to be captured.
    *   Passive Eavesdropping: Simply listening for keyfob transmissions in close proximity during normal operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within range of the keyfob signal to intercept it.
*   **Technical Capability:** The attacker needs to have the equipment to intercept and record radio signals, this could be an SDR (Software Defined Radio) for example.
*   **Knowledge:** The attacker requires knowledge of the described attack methodology.

**Additional Notes**

*   The "RollBack" attack is a new method of exploiting rolling codes.
*   The vulnerability is due to a design flaw rather than a bug, and it is documented in the rolling code chip datasheets.
*   The attack is more severe than previously known replay attacks like RollJam because the compromise is permanent and not time-sensitive.
*   Mitigation is difficult due to the design of the resynchronization process.
*   The attack appears to affect a wide range of vehicles, making it a significant security concern.
*   Manual transmission vehicles are not immune to this specific attack as the car can still be stolen by other means.
*   Proximity key systems are potentially not affected by this attack.
