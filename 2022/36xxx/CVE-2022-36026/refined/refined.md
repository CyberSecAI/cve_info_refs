Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36026:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` operation in TensorFlow did not properly validate the `num_bits` input tensor. It was expected to be a scalar (rank <= 1 and have only 1 element), but the code didn't enforce this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the missing validation for the rank and number of elements of the `num_bits` tensor in the `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` operation.
- **CHECK Failure:**  Providing an invalid `num_bits` tensor (non-scalar) triggers a `CHECK` failure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The `CHECK` failure causes the program to crash, leading to a denial of service. This means that an attacker can disrupt the availability of the TensorFlow model/service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow graph with a `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` op that includes a non-scalar tensor for the `num_bits` input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to control the input tensor:** The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `num_bits` input tensor that is fed to the `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` operation. This could occur in a variety of scenarios, for instance, if the attacker is able to supply an input to a tensorflow model which utilizes the vulnerable code.
- **No special permissions are required**.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub commit [f3f9cb38ecfe5a8a703f2c4a8fead434ef291713](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f3f9cb38ecfe5a8a703f2c4a8fead434ef291713) implements a fix by adding validation to the `Compute()` method, checking that the `num_bits` tensor is indeed a scalar.
- Patched versions include 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Neophytos Christou.
- Severity is considered "Low".
- No CWEs were identified.

In summary, this CVE describes a vulnerability in TensorFlow where a lack of input validation could lead to a denial of service. The fix ensures the `num_bits` input tensor is correctly validated.
