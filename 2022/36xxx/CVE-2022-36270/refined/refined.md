The provided content details a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Clinic's Patient Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Unrestricted file upload vulnerability exists in `users.php`
- The application does not properly validate the file type or content uploaded through the `profile_picture` field, allowing an attacker to upload a PHP file.
- The uploaded file is stored in a publicly accessible directory (`pms\user_images`), allowing direct access via the browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload
- Lack of file type validation
- Lack of file content validation
- Publicly accessible upload directory

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server, allowing the attacker to perform malicious actions, including potentially gaining complete control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/pms/users.php` with a crafted `multipart/form-data` containing a PHP file disguised as a profile picture.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application (e.g., a web browser or a tool like curl or a custom script).
- Knowledge of the application's URL structure and the parameters it expects for user creation.
