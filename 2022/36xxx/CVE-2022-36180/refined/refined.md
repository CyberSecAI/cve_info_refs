Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36180:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application does not sanitize the `message` and `plug` parameters in the URL, leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- The session cookie lacks the `HttpOnly` flag.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the browser of a victim.
- The lack of the `HttpOnly` flag on the session cookie allows the attacker to steal the victim's session cookie via JavaScript execution.
- This can lead to privilege escalation based on the compromised user's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts malicious URLs that include JavaScript code within the `message` and `plug` parameters.
- The victim clicks on the malicious URL, triggering the injected JavaScript to execute in their browser.
- Malicious URLs examples:
    - `GET /fusiondirectory/index.php?message=<img+src=1+onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
    - `GET /fusiondirectory/index.php?message=invalidparameter&plug=<img+src=1+onerror=alert(document.cookie)>`
    - `GET /fusiondirectory/index.php?signout=1&message=<img+src=1+onerror=alert(document.cookie)>&plug=[id]`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to click a malicious URL.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in FusionDirectory version 1.3.
- The issue was fixed in version 1.3.1
- The session handling vulnerability (CVE-2022-36179) amplifies the XSS vulnerability, as an attacker can steal a session and wait for the user to authenticate.
- The identified XSS is a reflected one.
