The provided content relates to CVE-2022-36451.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A vulnerability in the web conferencing component of MiCollab allows the upload of malicious files.
- A vulnerability in the MiCollab Client server component of MiCollab allows Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- A vulnerability in the MiCollab Client API component allows an authenticated attacker to control another extension number or impersonate another user's name.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload in web conferencing component.
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the MiCollab Client server component.
- Insecure API allowing control of extension numbers and user impersonation in the MiCollab Client API component.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution within the context of the application due to malicious file uploads.
- Ability to leverage internal connections and permissions of the host server due to SSRF.
- Control over other extension numbers and user impersonation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading malicious files through the web conferencing interface.
- Exploiting the MiCollab Client server component through crafted requests, leading to SSRF.
- Exploiting the MiCollab Client API with valid credentials to control other extensions or impersonate users.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For malicious file upload, likely requires network access to the MiCollab web conferencing interface.
- For SSRF, likely requires network access to the MiCollab Client server.
- For the API vulnerability, requires valid user authentication.
