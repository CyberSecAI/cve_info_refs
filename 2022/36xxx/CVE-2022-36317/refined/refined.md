  "content": "The provided content contains information about CVE-2022-36317 which is described as a vulnerability where a long URL would hang Firefox for Android. \n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An overly long URL caused the user interface to hang. This was primarily due to the Android's `android.graphics.text.LineBreaker.nComputeLineBreaks` function being called when rendering URLs in the UI.\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper input sanitization/truncation for URLs specifically within the Android version of Firefox, leading to excessive processing by the UI. Also, the session restore mechanism would attempt to reload the same long URL, leading to a persistent DOS.\n-   **Impact of exploitation:** A denial of service (DOS) condition rendering the browser unusable. In severe cases, it would require the user to uninstall and reinstall Firefox, leading to potential data loss. The persistent nature of session restore would compound this issue.\n-   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a user visiting a malicious website or opening a link from an external app (e.g., email) containing an overly long URL. This would trigger the vulnerability when Firefox attempts to display the URL.\n-   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or host a URL with an extremely large number of characters and have the target user access it on Firefox for Android. The attacker could achieve this via email, web pages, etc."
