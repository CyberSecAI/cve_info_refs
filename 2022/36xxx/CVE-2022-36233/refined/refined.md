Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Tenda AC9 firmware has a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the `form_fast_setting_wifi_set` function of the `httpd` server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The code does not perform any length checks on the `ssid` request parameter before copying it to local variables `s` and `dest` using `strcpy`. This lack of validation allows an attacker to write beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, by overwriting return addresses and causing the application to crash.
- The provided content suggests it could lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address with a malicious address, however this was not fully proven in this content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/fast_setting_wifi_set` endpoint, with a long string value for the `ssid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the Tenda AC9 router's web interface.
- The attacker would likely need to be on the same network as the device (or have access to port forwarding).

**Technical details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates sending a string of 'a' characters followed by 'b' characters, which when over 96 bytes in length cause a crash after the strcpy function.
- Dynamic debugging revealed that the `r1` register is overwritten with `0x62626262` ('bbbb') demonstrating the overflow.
