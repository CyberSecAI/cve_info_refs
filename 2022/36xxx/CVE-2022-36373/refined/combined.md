How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

### [Excellent Addition!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-addition-9/)

I have numerous audio files on my site and all I wanted was for users to be able to download the files. So many added a replacement player or had you add code to each post with the player. This one allows both global and local settings. It handles single and playlist versions (though the single version doesn’t include a download, you can change it to always use the playlist version). Extremely customizable. Thank you for providing such a wonderful tool.

Works just as described and attractive styling too.

This is, for my website, the absolute best audio player plugin as it can be so simple! I love to have an audio clip be just text the user can click and hear – right in the paragraph if you want. I’ve used it for years and can’t find anything else I like.

i hate to say it but this plugin is broken, using latest version of WP.
If i am wrong i am sorry, but nothing that used to work is now working, and looking for a compatible and flexible audio plugin that is used to be the favorite of mine.

Working but have no much design and option for player control. The good thing is this player support any type of Radio stream link which is excellent. I’ll give 5 stars if possible to make a player like this https://i.imgur.com/s9ehQl5.png
Thanks
