### @NeloBlivion **[NeloBlivion](/NeloBlivion)** commented [Aug 15, 2022](#issue-1339588424)

Quick patch to how guild is received from a purely HTTP interaction

## Summary

A necessary fix to how an interaction's guild and user are assigned due to how interaction data is processed on a client without the `bot` scope. This patch allows avoiding the worst-case scenario, but further investigation into using this lib with HTTP clients is recommended.

* This PR fixes an issue.
* This PR adds something new (e.g. new method or parameters).
* This PR is a breaking change (e.g. methods or parameters removed/renamed).
* This PR is **not** a code change (e.g. documentation, README, typehinting, examples, ...).

Sorry, something went wrong.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
