Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36024:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the pycord library handles interaction data when a Discord bot is running with the `application.commands` scope but without the `bot` scope. Specifically, the library incorrectly assigns guild and user information when processing interactions from HTTP clients lacking the bot scope. This issue allows for a remote shutdown of a bot.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of interaction data from HTTP clients without bot scope.
- Incorrect assignment of guild and user information.
- Lack of proper checks or safeguards when processing interaction data in the absence of bot scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Remote shutdown of the Discord bot.
- Loss of availability of bot functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Adding a vulnerable bot to a discord server with `application.commands` scope but not `bot` scope.
- Executing a command in that server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to add a bot to a Discord server.
- Ability to trigger slash commands on a Discord server where the affected bot is running.
- No specific privileges are required on the target system running the bot.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in pycord version 2.0.0
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1
- All public bots that use slash commands are affected
