Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `get_rebase_infos` function when parsing dyld cache files. Specifically, the code calculates the total number of slide infos by summing individual `n_slide_infos`. If the individual `n_slide_infos` are too high, the sum can overflow, resulting in too few entries being allocated. This leads to an out-of-bounds write when accessing memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The code uses an integer type (`ut32`) to accumulate the total number of slide infos. When the sum exceeds the maximum value of `ut32`, the result wraps around, leading to a smaller-than-expected value and thus an undersized memory allocation.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** Because of the undersized memory allocation, subsequent write operations to this area can write beyond the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can craft a malicious dyld cache file that triggers the integer overflow. By carefully crafting the file contents, they can cause an out-of-bounds write, potentially overwriting critical data or code, and achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Dyld Cache File:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted dyld cache file. The attacker needs to entice the user into opening this malicious file using the vulnerable Rizin application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious dyld cache file, containing specific values for `n_slide_infos` to trigger the integer overflow.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious dyld cache file with a vulnerable version of Rizin.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in the `librz/bin/format/mach0/dyldcache.c` file.
*   The fix involves adding an overflow check during the calculation of `total_slide_infos`.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
* The vulnerability is related to the dyld cache binary plugin in Rizin.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by m4drat.
