Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2022-36533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Missing output encoding of profile settings allows users to store arbitrary JavaScript code in the profile settings, leading to code execution when the profiles are viewed.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Missing output encoding in error and status pages enables attackers to inject malicious scripts via crafted links, leading to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded when stored in the application's database, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. Specifically, the parameters `ProfileName`, `OriginalProfileName`, `LeftPath`, and `RightPath` are vulnerable.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-supplied data is not properly sanitized or encoded when reflected back to the user in error messages and status pages, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code execution. The parameter `profile` of `status.php` and the default error page are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of both stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This can be used to:
    *   Steal session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.
    *   Potentially achieve further access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker with access to the Syncovery application can inject malicious JavaScript code into the profile settings, which is executed when a user views the profiles.
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL that, when clicked by a user, will trigger the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser through an error or status page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The attacker needs access to the application to be able to modify profile settings.
*  **Reflected XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and distribute a malicious link to the target user. User interaction is required to activate the malicious script, i.e., the user needs to click on the crafted link.
