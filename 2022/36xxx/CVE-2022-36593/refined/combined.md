| 问题描述Description  kkFileview v4.0.0存在任意文件删除漏洞，可能导致系统任意文件被删除。  kkFileview v4.0.0 has an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability, which may lead to arbitrary file being deleted.  漏洞位置vulerable code location  src/main/java/cn/keking/web/controller/FileController.java文件78行，fileName参数用户可控，由于只截取"/"后面的内容作为文件名，导致可以利用“.."来实现目录遍历，导致任意文件删除漏洞。  The vulnerability code is located at line 78 in src/main/java/cn/keking/web/controller/FileController.java, the fileName parameter can be controlled by user. and it fetch the content after "/" as fileName, which leads to we can use ".." to achieve directory traverse that result in arbitrary file deletion.  [@RequestMapping](https://github.com/RequestMapping)(value = "deleteFile", method = RequestMethod.GET) public String deleteFile(String fileName) throws JsonProcessingException { if (fileName.contains("/")) { fileName = fileName.substring(fileName.lastIndexOf("/") + 1); } File file = new File(fileDir + demoPath + fileName); logger.info("删除文件：{}", file.getAbsolutePath()); if (file.exists() && !file.delete()) { logger.error("删除文件【{}】失败，请检查目录权限！",file.getPath()); } return new ObjectMapper().writeValueAsString(ReturnResponse.success()); }  漏洞证明PoC /deleteFile?fileName=demo%2F..\calc.pdf get请求此uri会删除\kkFileView-master\server\src\main\file目录中的calc.pdf（原本只能删除\kkFileView-master\server\src\main\file\demo目录下的文件)  POC /deleteFile?fileName=demo%2F..\calc.pdf request this uri by HTTP GET method will delete \kkFileView-master\server\src\main\file\calc.pdf (which logically should delete \kkFileView-master\server\src\main\file\demo\calc.pdf)  免责声明：请勿使用漏洞在他人部署的服务上进行测试、攻击，否则所有法律责任自行承担。 |

| 修复办法 private static Pattern FilePattern = Pattern.compile("[\\/:\*?"<>|]");  ``` /**  * 路径遍历 漏洞修复  * @param str  * @return  */ public static String filenameFilter(String str) {     return str==null?null:FilePattern.matcher(str).replaceAll(""); }  ```  fileName= filenameFilter(fileName); |
