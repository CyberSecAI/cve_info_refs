Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `deleteFile` function within `FileController.java`. The code extracts the filename by taking the substring after the last "/" character. It doesn't properly sanitize or validate the filename before using it to construct the file path for deletion. This allows an attacker to manipulate the filename parameter with directory traversal sequences such as `..` to reach files outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation and sanitization of the `fileName` parameter, allowing for path traversal using sequences like `..`.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** By controlling the path, an attacker can delete files outside the intended directory, leading to arbitrary file deletion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file accessible to the application's user account on the server's filesystem.
*   **Potential for Data Loss:** The deletion of files could result in data loss.
*   **Potential for System Instability:** Deleting critical system files or application files can lead to system instability and application malfunction.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request to the `/deleteFile` endpoint, with a manipulated `fileName` parameter.
*   **Filename Manipulation:** The `fileName` parameter is manipulated to include `..` sequences to traverse up the directory structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application server.
*   **Understanding of API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint `/deleteFile` and how to craft the malicious `fileName` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** There is no mention of any authentication or authorization required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was tested on a Windows environment and may not be exploitable on Unix-based systems, though the root cause of the vulnerability (lack of path validation/sanitization) is the same on all systems.
*   A fix was implemented by using a regular expression to filter out potentially dangerous characters from the filename before deletion is attempted.
*   The PoC provided in the issue demonstrates deleting `calc.pdf` outside the intended directory by using `/deleteFile?fileName=demo%2F..\calc.pdf`
