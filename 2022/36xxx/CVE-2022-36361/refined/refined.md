Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36361:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the affected devices not properly validating the structure of TCP packets within several methods.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation when processing TCP packets.
- Classic buffer overflow vulnerability (CWE-120) due to a lack of size checking of input when copying data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a buffer overflow.
- This overflow can allow the attacker to gain control of the instruction counter.
- The attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- It exploits a weakness in how the devices handle TCP packets received over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N).
- The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).
- The attacker needs network access to send malformed TCP packets to the affected device.
