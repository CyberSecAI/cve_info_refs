```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Apache Calcite Avatica JDBC driver creates HTTP client instances based on class names provided via the `httpclient_impl` connection property. It fails to verify if the class implements the expected interface before instantiating it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation",
      "Unsafe class instantiation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. In rare cases, remote code execution is possible if a vulnerable class with a constructor that takes a URL parameter and executes code is present in the classpath.",
    "attack_vectors": "By controlling the JDBC connection parameters, specifically the `httpclient_impl` property.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have privileges to control JDBC connection parameters. A vulnerable class with a constructor that takes a URL parameter and executes code needs to be present in the classpath."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is fixed in Apache Calcite Avatica version 1.22.0 onwards by verifying if the class implements the expected interface before invoking its constructor."
