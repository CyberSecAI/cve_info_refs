Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36000:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tf.raw_ops.Eig` operation in TensorFlow did not properly validate the output scalar type (`Tout`). When calling the raw ops version of `Eig`, it was possible to provide an output scalar type that didn't match the expected one, leading to a failing check during computation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Type mismatch vulnerability:** The `Eig` operation, when accessed through `tf.raw_ops`, was susceptible to an incorrect `Tout` input. This lack of input validation on the output scalar type allowed for providing incompatible types, such as specifying `complex128` when the operation internally expected `complex64`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The type mismatch vulnerability could cause a `CHECK` failure, leading to a denial of service. The program would likely terminate abruptly upon the failing assertion, disrupting service availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Directly calling the `tf.raw_ops.Eig` operation and providing an incorrect `Tout` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to call the `tf.raw_ops.Eig` operation with arbitrary arguments including `Tout`. This usually requires the attacker to have some control over the TensorFlow program, or be able to inject specially crafted inputs to the raw operations.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered only when using the `tf.raw_ops` versions of the `Eig` operation, not through the official public API.
-   The fix involves adding an input validation check for the `Tout` parameter. This ensures that the output scalar type matches the expected type.
-   The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.10.0 and cherry-picked for versions 2.9.2, 2.8.3, and 2.7.4.
