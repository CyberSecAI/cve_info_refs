Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation of user-provided input within the "Better PDF Exporter for Jira" add-on. Specifically, the description field of PDF templates is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to a stored XSS attack. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored within the application's database, which is then executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected part of the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of other logged-in users' browsers. This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user (e.g., modifying data, creating issues, deleting information)
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies/session data)
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the user interface

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the description field of a PDF template within the "Better PDF Exporter" add-on's administration backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit PDF templates within the "Better PDF Exporter" add-on settings, which typically requires administrative privileges within Jira.
*   The attacker needs to be logged into the Jira system

**Technical Details**

*   The vulnerable parameter is the `description` field when creating or updating a PDF template.
*   The provided PoC demonstrates injecting the following payload `<script>alert('SySS\_PXSS\_PoC');</script>` into the description.
*   When the "PDF Template" overview page (`/secure/pdf-resources.jspa`) is accessed, the stored XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was identified by SySS GmbH.
*   The affected version is 10.0.0, while version 9.6.0 was used for testing.
*   The vendor was notified on 2022-05-27 and the advisory was made public on 2022-07-22.
