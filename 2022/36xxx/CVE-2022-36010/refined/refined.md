Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-36010.

**Root Cause:** The `react-editable-json-tree` library used JavaScript's `eval` function to execute strings beginning with "function" within JSON data. This allowed arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses:**
- Use of `eval` for parsing function strings, allowing for arbitrary code injection.
- Default `onSubmitValueParser` prop was vulnerable, allowing execution of function strings.

**Impact:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the client-side when displaying JSON data, potentially from untrusted sources.
- The vulnerability could lead to various attacks depending on the context of the application using the library, such as data exfiltration, modifying application behavior, or even full takeover of the user's machine via client side exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By injecting malicious function strings within a JSON structure that is displayed using the `react-editable-json-tree` library, especially when this data comes from untrusted sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious JSON data, and for it to be displayed by an application utilizing the vulnerable library.
- No special privileges or user interaction are required for the exploit to succeed.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to version 2.2.2 or later.
- For version 2.2.2, explicitly set the `allowFunctionEvaluation` prop to `false`.
- For versions >= 3.0.0, the `allowFunctionEvaluation` prop is `false` by default.
- Alternatively, defining a custom `onSubmitValueParser` callback on the `JsonTree` component avoids using the vulnerable default parser.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix switched from using `eval` to `Function` constructor for function evaluation, which is considered safer.
- The CVSS v3 score is 10.0, indicating a critical severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-95 (Improper Neutralization of Directives in Dynamically Evaluated Code ('Eval Injection')).
