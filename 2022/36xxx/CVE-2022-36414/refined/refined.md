- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Windows installer for Beyond Compare versions 4.2.0 through 4.4.2, when run as SYSTEM, launches the Clipboard Compare tray application with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Elevation of privilege vulnerability. A standard user can exploit the elevated Clipboard Compare tray application to launch a command prompt with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A standard user can gain SYSTEM level privileges, allowing them to perform actions normally restricted to administrators.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves exploiting the elevated privileges of the Clipboard Compare tray app, which runs after installation when the installer is executed with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a standard user on the system where the vulnerable software is installed. They need to be able to launch Beyond Compare through the tray app. The installer needs to have been run with SYSTEM privileges at some point.
