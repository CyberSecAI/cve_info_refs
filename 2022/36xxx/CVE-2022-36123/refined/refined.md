Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36123:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the Linux kernel's failure to properly clear statically allocated variables within the `.bss` section during early boot for Xen paravirtualized (PV) guests. This failure occurs due to a flawed `early_xen_iret_patch`, which was later removed but exposed the underlying issue. The `.brk` section which is similar to `.bss`, was not being cleared. If kexec is used, the 2nd kernel .bss may contain uninitialized resources and may not be cleared, because the mappings are not part of the initially mapped 2M pages used by kexec, those setup_data entries need to be mapped there too.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Initialization:** The kernel's boot process, specifically when handling Xen PV guests, wasn't ensuring that the `.bss` and `.brk` sections, which contain statically allocated variables, were properly cleared (zeroed) before usage.
*   **Failed Patch:** The `early_xen_iret_patch`, intended to handle a specific scenario, was not properly implemented and was later removed. The removal revealed the need for a proper `clear_bss()` which included `.brk` too, and identity mappings for setup\_data entries for kexec'ed kernels.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** Failure to clear the `.bss` and `.brk` can result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a kernel panic.
*   **Kernel Oops/Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can lead to kernel oops, potentially causing a denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In some circumstances, the vulnerability could be exploited for arbitrary code execution (though this is not directly detailed, it is mentioned).
*   **Access to restricted memory:** Virtualized devices connected to the Xen IOMMU can potentially access restricted memory due to uninitialized data.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Unprivileged Attack:** An unprivileged local attacker on the host or guest system can exploit this flaw.
*   **XenPV Guests:** The vulnerability specifically affects Xen PV guests, as it is related to how the hypervisor validates page tables and the lack of initialized data in the `.bss` section.
*   **Kexec:** Using kexec can expose the vulnerability if the second kernel's `.bss` is not cleared, as mappings may not be set correctly.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected system (either the host or the guest in a Xen PV setup).
*   **No Specific Privileges:** The attacker does not require elevated privileges for the initial exploit (unprivileged local attacker).
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Kernel:**  The attacker would need to be using a vulnerable Linux kernel version (v5.18-rc1 through v5.19-rc6).

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the interaction between the Linux kernel's memory management, how it handles Xen PV guests, and a failed attempt to implement `early_xen_iret_patch`.
*   The fix involves ensuring that `clear_bss()` properly handles the `.brk` area at early boot.
*   The vulnerability can lead to `asm_exc_page_fault`.
*   The fix also includes adding `xen_set_restricted_virtio_memory_access` via `CONFIG_XEN_VIRTIO` kernel config.
*   The issue was discovered on stable kernel 5.18.11 after it was already fixed in mainline 5.19.rc6.
*   The vulnerability was present in the x86 architecture when running as Xen PV guest.
*  The vulnerability can lead to a null pointer dereference within the `copy_fpstate_to_sigframe` function, specifically related to accessing an address of `0000000000000344`.
