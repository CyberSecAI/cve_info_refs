Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `modify.php` file of the Library Management System v1.0, specifically within the handling of the `Textbook` parameter. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of sanitization of the `Textbook` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: The provided payload `1'+union+select+1,2,3,database(),5,6,7,8,9,10--+` is used to extract the database name. Attackers can potentially access and modify other sensitive data, including usernames, passwords, or other important information within the database.
- Data manipulation: Attackers can modify, insert, or delete records in the database.
- Potential system compromise: In some circumstances, SQL Injection can allow for OS command execution, allowing a complete compromise of the host.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is exploited via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/LMS/admin/modify.php` endpoint. The malicious SQL payload is included in the `Textbook` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the server hosting the Library Management System.
- Knowledge of vulnerable parameter: The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `Textbook` parameter in the `modify.php` file.
- Ability to send HTTP requests: The attacker should be able to craft and send HTTP requests, such as using a browser or a tool like curl.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected software is Library Management System v1.0 by kingbhob02.
- The software is built using xmapp-php8.1.
- The provided content contains a specific example of a SQL injection payload.
- The content includes a code snippet demonstrating the HTTP POST request used to exploit the vulnerability.
