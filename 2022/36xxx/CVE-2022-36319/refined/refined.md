Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how Firefox handles CSS transforms combined with overflow properties. Specifically, when `overflow-block: hidden` is used along with a large `transform: scale` or `matrix` value, the mouse cursor interacts with coordinates different from what is displayed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Mouse Position Spoofing:** The core issue is that the visual position of the mouse cursor does not match the actual position where clicks are registered. This allows an attacker to manipulate mouse clicks and redirects to unintended locations on the screen.
- **Incorrect Hit Testing:** The browser's hit-testing mechanism, responsible for determining which element is clicked, fails when very large CSS transforms are applied, particularly when combined with overflow properties. This is caused by floating point inaccuracies when calculating inverse transforms
- **APZ (Asynchronous Pan/Zoom) Issue:** The problem is linked to the APZ component and how it interacts with the Webrender graphics engine. The bug is triggered when a scroll frame is activated by the dialog and the untransformed mouse coordinates are used on this dialog.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypassing Permission Prompts:** An attacker can force a user to unknowingly grant permissions (location, camera, microphone etc) by manipulating click positions.
- **WebExtension Installation:** An attacker could trick a user into installing a malicious browser extension without explicit consent.
- **Context Menu Spoofing:** The attacker could cause the right-click context menu to appear at an incorrect location. This shows that the issue also affects mouse input other than left click.
- **UI Manipulation:** More broadly, this vulnerability allows an attacker to interact with UI elements without the user's knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector involves a malicious webpage that uses large CSS transformations and `overflow-block:hidden`  to trigger the issue.
- The attacker needs to control the HTML and CSS of the page to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to host or inject malicious HTML/CSS that can apply specific CSS transforms and overflow properties.
- The attacker does not need any special position in the network to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The bug is reproducible when using the WebRender engine and with Fission enabled.
- The vulnerability is caused by a combination of CSS transforms, overflow properties, and how mouse events are dispatched in the browser.
- The issue was caused by a regression introduced by fix in bug 1675547 that activated inactive scroll frames in OOPIFs, which exposed the issue

The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a check to ensure the transform matrix of an APZC multiplied by it's inverse is close to the identity matrix. If it is not then it is treated as non-invertible and does not produce a hit.
