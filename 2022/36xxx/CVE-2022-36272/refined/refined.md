- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of user-provided input in the `validated` method. This method copies the `fieldName` and `fieldValue` directly into a `where` object. Subsequently, the `appBiz.queryBySQL` method is called, leading to the execution of a crafted SQL query. The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `fieldName` from user input is directly used in the SQL query without proper sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to unsanitized user input being used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `fieldName` from user input is directly placed into the SQL `WHERE` clause.

- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. As demonstrated, this can be leveraged to induce time-based blind SQL injection, where the attacker can use functions like `sleep()` to confirm the injection and potentially exfiltrate data, modify or delete data.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the `/${ms.manager.path}/mdiy/page/verify` endpoint, where the `fieldName` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. The attacker can send a malicious request with crafted `fieldName` and `fieldValue` parameters.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires access to the `/${ms.manager.path}/mdiy/page/verify` endpoint. It is noted that this is a "后台" (back-end) vulnerability implying the attacker may need to be authenticated into the backend of the application.
