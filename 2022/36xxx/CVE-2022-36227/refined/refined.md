No idea how a null pointer dereference could lead to code execution.

        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The root cause is the absence of a NULL check after calling `calloc` within the `__archive_write_allocate_filter` function. If `calloc` fails to allocate memory, it returns NULL, which is then dereferenced, causing the vulnerability.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference. The code attempts to use the memory pointed to by the result of `calloc` without validating that it is not NULL.",
        "Impact of exploitation": "The immediate impact of exploitation is a crash due to the NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of service. The reporter also points out that in rare circumstances, if NULL is mapped to a memory address that can be accessed, arbitrary code execution might be possible, although this is very platform-specific.",
         "Attack vectors": "The primary attack vector involves triggering memory allocation failures, which makes `calloc` return NULL, leading to the dereference and a crash.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires the ability to influence the system in a way that causes memory allocation to fail, for example, by exhausting available memory. The vulnerability is present in the library itself and can potentially be exploited if the library is used in a way that interacts with untrusted inputs, thus, potentially a remote attack vector is also applicable if the program handles untrusted archive files."
