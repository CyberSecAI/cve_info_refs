The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Edit_BasicSSID_5G` function.
- The `sscanf` function with the format specifier `%[^;]` is used to parse input, which is a greedy matching mechanism.
- Input larger than the buffer `V30` will cause a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded string copy/parsing using `sscanf`
- Insecure use of the `%[^;]` format specifier, which reads characters until a semicolon without bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can achieve a stable root shell on the device by exploiting the stack overflow.
- Can lead to denial-of-service attacks by using carefully crafted data to overwrite return addresses or other critical stack data

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/aspForm`.
- The vulnerable `param` is part of the POST data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web interface of the router.
- The attacker likely needs some level of network access to the device.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as a requirement in the provided text.

**Additional details:**
- The provided Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrates how to trigger the stack overflow by sending a long string of 'A' characters.
- The post shows process id changes after sending the crafted post request.
- By controlling the overflow, a stable root shell can be obtained on the device.
