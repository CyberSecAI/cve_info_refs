Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36763:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input validation in the `Tcg2MeasureGptTable()` function when processing a GPT (GUID Partition Table). Specifically, there are no checks for integer overflows when calculating the size of memory needed to store partition entries based on the provided GPT primary header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code multiplies `NumberOfPartitionEntries` by `SizeOfPartitionEntry` without verifying that the result does not overflow, which could lead to a small value being used.
- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The overflowed result is used to allocate a buffer using `AllocateZeroPool()`.  The allocation size is smaller than required leading to heap buffer overflow, when the partition entries are copied into the buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The heap buffer overflow can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution during the DXE phase, which occurs early in the boot process. This can be achieved by:
    - **Heap corruption:** Corrupting heap metadata (like PREV-NEXT pointers) to perform an unlink attack, potentially overwriting UEFI application code or BootServices table pointers (since all memory is RWX by default).
    - **Direct code overwrite:** Overwriting UEFI application code by overflowing the heap buffer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted GPT table loaded from disk, meaning a malicious disk image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to modify the storage media to use malicious GPT.
- **Low Privileges:** The vulnerability can be triggered with low privileges, meaning limited permissions are necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is present in EDK2 versions up to and including 202311.
- Patches are available and will be included in the February 2024 EDK2 release.
- The CVSS score is 7.0 with a base metric of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H, indicating a local attack with high complexity, low privileges and no user interaction, with a scope change, and low confidentiality and integrity impact, but high availability impact.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-680.
