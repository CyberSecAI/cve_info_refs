Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of user-supplied Python script code within the `ScriptInvoke` function of Inductive Automation Ignition. This code is compiled and executed at runtime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unsafe Script Execution:** The application directly executes user-provided Python code without proper sanitization or sandboxing, which allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected server running Inductive Automation Ignition. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, system disruption, and further propagation within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **ScriptInvoke Function:** The attack vector is the vulnerable `ScriptInvoke` function which is used to execute the malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication Required (but bypassable):** While the direct exploitation of this vulnerability requires authentication, the provided advisory notes that there is a separate authentication bypass vulnerability (CVE-2022-35890) that can be used to gain initial access.
- **Admin Privileges on vulnerable software (or bypassed auth):** An admin user needs to be logged into the gateway to use the exploit, or a bypass vulnerability must be used to gain access.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Pre-Authentication RCE:** Although authentication is technically required, the vulnerability can be combined with the authentication bypass (CVE-2022-35890) to achieve pre-authentication RCE. The exploit mentioned in the documentation leverages both of these vulnerabilities.
- **Windows Environment Specifics:** The exploit is designed to work in a Windows environment due to a weakness in the `SecureRandom` implementation in that context.
- **Targeted versions**  <= 8.1.16 of Inductive Automation Ignition are vulnerable.
- **Fix Availability:** The vendor (Inductive Automation) has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
