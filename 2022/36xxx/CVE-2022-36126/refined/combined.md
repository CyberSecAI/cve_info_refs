## What

This is a pre-authenticated RCE exploit for Inductive Automation Ignition that impacts versions <= 8.1.16. We failed to exploit the bugs at Pwn2Own Miami 2022 because we had a sloppy exploit and no debug environment, but since then we have found the time and energy to improve it!

## Authors

Chris Anastasio and Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Incite Team

## Build

1. Build with `mvn clean compile assembly:single -DskipTests`

## Tested

The exploit was tested against [8.1.16](https://inductiveautomation.com/downloads/archive/8.1.16) using the Windows 64-bit Installer which you can [download here](https://files.inductiveautomation.com/release/ia/8.1.16/20220405-1206/ignition-8.1.16-windows-64-installer.exe) (SHA1: f135d32228793c73c4cdd88561cdbdb44b19290c) but it has known to work against other older versions as well.

## Notes

* At the time of release, no CVE's were assigned to the bugs
* This exploit takes advantage of two vulnerabilities that have been [patched](https://support.inductiveautomation.com/hc/en-us/articles/7625759776653):

  + [CVE-2022-35890 - GatewaySessionManagerImpl Authentication Bypass](https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2022-0013/)
  + [CVE-2022-36126 - ScriptInvoke Remote Code Execution](https://srcincite.io/advisories/src-2022-0014/)
* The exploit requires an admin user to be logged into the gateway. During testing it was found that sessions live forever unless a user explicitly logs out.
* The exploit should be ran from a Windows host (due to the `SecureRandom` seed prediction attack).
* The exploit targets Ignition deployed under Windows, since `SecureRandom` is not so secure under that environment.
* The exploit was tested with Java v11.0.11.

## Run

Run the exploit with `java -cp target/randy-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar com.srcincite.ia.exploit.Poc`

#### **SRC-2022-0014 : Inductive Automation Ignition ScriptInvoke Remote Code Execution Vulnerability**

**CVE ID:**
CVE-2022-36126

**CVSS Score:**
7.2, [(/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=(/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

**Affected Vendors:**
Inductive

**Affected Products:**
Inductive Automation Ignition

**Vulnerability Details:**
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.
The specific flaw exists within ScriptInvoke function.

The issue results from the unsafe use of user supplied python script code that is compiled and executed at runtime.

**Vendor Response:**

Inductive has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: <https://support.inductiveautomation.com/hc/en-us/articles/7625759776653>

**Disclosure Timeline:**

* 2022-04-22 – Sent to Inductive PSIRT
* 2022-05-12 – Coordinated public release of advisory

**Proof of Concept:**
<https://github.com/sourceincite/randy>

**Credit:**
This vulnerability was discovered by Chris Anastasio (muffin) and Steven Seeley (mr\_me) of Incite Team

#### **SRC-2022-0013 : Inductive Automation Ignition GatewaySessionManagerImpl Authentication Bypass Vulnerability**

**CVE ID:**
CVE-2022-35890

**CVSS Score:**
8.1, [(/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=(/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

**Affected Vendors:**
Inductive

**Affected Products:**
Inductive Automation Ignition

**Vulnerability Details:**
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication on affected installations of Inductive Automation Ignition. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within GatewaySessionManagerImpl class.

The issue results from the use of a fixed seed for session id generation when using the SecureRandom API. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to predict an authenticated session and access the gateway.

**Vendor Response:**

Inductive has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: <https://support.inductiveautomation.com/hc/en-us/articles/7625759776653>
