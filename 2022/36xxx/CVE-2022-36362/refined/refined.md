- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not perform certain validations when interacting with them.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can manipulate the device's IP address, rendering the device unreachable. The device can only be recovered by power cycling.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the device, and does not need to authenticate.
