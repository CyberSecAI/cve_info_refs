- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Boundary versions up to 0.10.1 did not properly perform data integrity checks to ensure resources were associated with the correct scopes. Specifically, both Boundary host sets and credential sources allowed unintended linking across projects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper data integrity checks, allowing cross-project linking of resources.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential privilege escalation for authorized users of another scope by linking resources across project scopes.
- **Attack vectors**: An authorized operator of a given scope with knowledge of a machine-generated alphanumeric identifier of a host set or credential source belonging to another project scope can perform the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An authorized operator of a given scope with knowledge of a machine-generated alphanumeric identifier of a resource from another scope.
