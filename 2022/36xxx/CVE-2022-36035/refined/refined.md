The content is related to CVE-2022-36035.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user-supplied input in the Flux CLI, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows attackers to replace Flux deployment information with arbitrary content, leading to the deployment of malicious content into the target Kubernetes cluster.
-  Potential for arbitrary code execution on the cluster, depending on the malicious content deployed.
- Users may not realize something is amiss, as no errors may be presented in certain scenarios.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access on the same shell where the Flux CLI is being used.
- Other applications sharing the same shell as the Flux CLI can manipulate deployment information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the same shell environment where the Flux CLI is used.
- The attacker needs to be able to run other applications in the same shell environment.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate input to the Flux CLI commands.

The advisory also provides details on the affected versions and the patched version, along with mitigation strategies. Specifically, it mentions that executing Flux CLI in ephemeral and isolated shell environments can act as a workaround. The vulnerability was found and patched by the Flux engineering team.
