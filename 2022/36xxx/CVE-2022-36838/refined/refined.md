Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-36838:

**CVE-2022-36838:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Implicit intent hijacking
*   **Affected Component:** Galaxy Wearable
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of implicit intents within the Galaxy Wearable application.
*  **Weakness:** The application uses implicit intents where it should use explicit intents, making it vulnerable to hijacking by malicious apps.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to potentially gain access to sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious application can intercept and hijack the implicit intent, thereby gaining access to the data that was intended for the legitimate app.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have the ability to install a malicious app on the device with the ability to intercept intents.
*   **Resolved Version:** 2.2.50
*   **Acknowledgement:** Sergey Toshin of Oversecured Inc

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is caused by the use of implicit intents in the Galaxy Wearable app, which can be hijacked by a malicious app to access sensitive information. The fix changes the intent type from implicit to explicit.
