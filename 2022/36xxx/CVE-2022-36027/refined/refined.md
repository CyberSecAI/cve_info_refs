Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises during the conversion of TensorFlow models to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format, specifically when dealing with transposed convolutions that use per-channel weight quantization. The TFLite converter fails to handle the specific combination of transposed convolution and per-channel quantization correctly, leading to a segfault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect handling of quantized transposed convolutions:** The converter does not correctly process the per-channel quantization parameters when applied to transposed convolution operations.
- **Segfault:** The failure in conversion leads to a segmentation fault, which crashes the Python process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact is a crash of the TFLite converter, preventing successful model conversion. This can disrupt the workflow of users attempting to use per-channel quantized transposed convolutions with TFLite.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Model Conversion:** The attack vector is triggered during the conversion process of a TensorFlow model to TFLite, specifically when a model contains a transposed convolution layer with per-channel quantized weights.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to create/modify TensorFlow models:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a TensorFlow model that includes a transposed convolution with per-channel weight quantization.
- **Access to TFLite converter:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the TensorFlow Lite converter.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was introduced in TensorFlow version 2.6 and has been fixed in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Lukas Geiger via Github issue.
- The provided code snippets demonstrate how to reproduce the issue, and showcase the necessary combination of operations that trigger the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
