Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36975

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `ProfileDaoImpl` class within Ivanti Avalanche.
- A crafted request can trigger the execution of SQL queries constructed using a user-supplied string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the insecure construction of SQL queries using user-supplied data.
- Authentication Bypass: By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the system by circumventing the standard authentication procedures.
- Potential for further malicious activities: Once authenticated, attackers could potentially perform a wide range of unauthorized actions depending on their access level.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request over the network.
- Remote: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without requiring local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges required: The attacker does not need any prior access or credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
- Network access: Attackers must have network connectivity to the affected system to send malicious requests.

**Summary:**
CVE-2022-36975 is an SQL injection vulnerability in Ivanti Avalanche that can be exploited by sending a crafted network request to the server, enabling a remote attacker to bypass authentication. The vulnerability exists due to insecure SQL query construction within the `ProfileDaoImpl` class, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
