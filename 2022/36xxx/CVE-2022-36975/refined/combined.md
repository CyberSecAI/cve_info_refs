Release Information:
Product: AvalanchePremise\_6.2.0
Description: Avalanche Premise 6.2.0 for Windows
Version: v6.2.0.602
Notes: Avalanche 6.2.0 Release
Key New/Changed features Overview:
Enrollment
Enrollment rules now determine whether the enabler will use ANS or GCM as the notification service on android.
A new type of enrollment rule has been created called a reference Enrollment Rule (Global Enrollment Rule) has been added that allows rules to be added at regions and deployed to multiple SDservers. You may add a folder that will be created and deployed at the root of all SDservers below the rules region.
Broadcast to enroll
When a enroll.prf file has been placed on the device with âbroadcastâ as the server address, it will now perform a UDP broadcast to find a listening SDServer on the same subnet.
Multiple Smart Device Servers
The SDS node has been altered to have a local Inforail, SDServer, ANServer and File Store. In order to allow this, a SDServer profile has been created.
SDS Profile
The settings for the central SDS have been moved from the system settings page into a new Smart Device Server Profile. These include: APNS Cert, Google GCM Info, HTTPS Cert, SDS Public Address, Automatic Smart Device Check In, Smart Device Client Administrator Password.
SDS Profiles Inheritance has changed, they will aggregate settings instead of overwriting. This allows you to set things like APNS, GCM and wildcard HTTPS certs at a higher level and have them set at lower SDS in the tree. You can then set specific settings such as the SDS public address, or check in times at a locally applied SDS profile.
Device Folder Assignment setting allows the enrollment to be placed in a static folder or dynamically place based on folder selection criteria
UDP Service Discovery allows the SDS to listen for enrollment broadcasts from the enabler.
Central File Store
These settings allow you to point to a file share. Files can be uploaded and managed via the Central File Store. You can then use these files in Android manifest URL software payloads, Android file payloads and Android OS Update payloads.
Upon deployment of these payloads to an SDS the files will be cached in a file store local to the SDS.
Implemented Zebra MX Extensions
Now Android Agent applies StageNow config file "avamxmf.xml" placed specific location on SD card "/sdcard/Ivanti/MXMF" using MX framework. Log "MXMS configuration XML file applied successfully" will be displayed when MX config file applied.
