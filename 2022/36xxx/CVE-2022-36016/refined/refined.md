Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36016:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-36016. The GitHub security advisory for `GHSA-g468-qj8g-vcjc` explicitly mentions this CVE ID.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability lies within the `tensorflow::full_type::SubstituteFromAttrs` function, specifically in the `SubstituteForEach` subroutine.
   - The code used `DCHECK_EQ(t.args_size(), 3)` to verify that the `FullTypeDef& t` has exactly 3 arguments.
   -  `DCHECK` causes the program to crash when the condition is not met, instead of returning a status. This can cause a denial of service.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Lack of proper input validation:** The code uses a `DCHECK` (debug check) for input validation, which is not suitable for production environments. It should use a regular `if` condition to return an error status.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The `DCHECK` failure leads to a program crash (abort), creating a potential DoS vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service:** An attacker can trigger the `DCHECK` failure in `SubstituteForEach` by crafting a `FullTypeDef` with a number of arguments different than 3. This causes the program to crash and prevents it from processing further requests.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - The vulnerability is triggered when `tensorflow::full_type::SubstituteFromAttrs` receives a crafted `FullTypeDef` with incorrect arguments size. This suggests that the attack vector involves manipulating input data to the vulnerable function through TensorFlow API or model definitions that utilize full type information and for each loops.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs the ability to supply input data, model definitions or operations containing the malformed `FullTypeDef` to the affected TensorFlow component. This means they have to be in a position where they can influence the data processed by TensorFlow.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix replaces the `DCHECK` with a regular `if` check and returns an error status, preventing the crash.
- The commit `6104f0d4091c260ce9352f9155f7e9b725eab012` provides the fix by replacing the `DCHECK` with an `if` statement that returns an error status.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions before 2.10.0, and is patched in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "low."
- The advisory notes that no specific CWE is associated with this vulnerability.
