Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input before it is used in SQL queries. Specifically, the application directly incorporates user-provided data from HTTP GET parameters into SQL queries, which leads to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The application is vulnerable to multiple SQL injection flaws. These vulnerabilities are present in the following files:
    *   `/patient/doctors.php`
    *   `/patient/booking.php`
    *  `/patient/settings.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, including user credentials, personal information, and appointment details.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data in the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Full database access:**  The attacker can potentially gain full control over the database server by executing arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to further compromise of the system or server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests that inject malicious SQL code into vulnerable parameters:
    *   The `id` parameter in `/patient/doctors.php`, `/patient/booking.php` and `/patient/settings.php`.
    * The `action` parameter in `/patient/settings.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely without any prior authentication, provided they can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and SQL injection techniques. Tools like Burp Suite and sqlmap can be used for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Blind SQLi in `/patient/doctors.php`:** The provided PoC demonstrates a time-based blind SQLi using `SLEEP()` function, where the attacker can infer information by the time taken to load the page based on the injected query.
*   **SQLi in `/patient/booking.php`:** The PoC showcases multiple types of SQL injection, including boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based, and UNION query injections.
*   **SQLi in `/patient/settings.php`:** Similar to `/patient/booking.php`, the PoC demonstrates boolean-based blind, error-based, time-based, and UNION query injections.
*   **Exploitation Tools:** The content refers to using `sqlmap` to automate the SQL injection exploitation.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The vulnerable parameters are the `id` and `action` parameters in the URLs.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerable application is the "edoc-doctor-appointment-system" version 1.0.1, which is an open-source PHP application.
*   The vendor of the software is identified as `https://github.com/HashenUdara/edoc-doctor-appointment-system`.
* The content also includes detailed steps to reproduce these vulnerabilities, showing how to capture HTTP requests and exploit them with sqlmap.
