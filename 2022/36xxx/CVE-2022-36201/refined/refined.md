Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36201:

**1. Verification:**
   - The GitHub content explicitly mentions `CVE-2022-36201` and states:  `A Blind SQLi vulnerability was found in Doctor's Appointment System version 1.0`. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection (Blind SQLi). This means the application does not directly display the results of the SQL queries, making it harder to exploit. The attacker needs to infer information based on application response times or behavior.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   -  The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries. This allows malicious SQL code to be injected through the application's input fields and executed against the database.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   -  A successful Blind SQLi attack can allow an attacker to extract sensitive information from the database, which may include user credentials, personal data, or other confidential details.
   - Depending on the database permissions, an attacker might also be able to modify or delete data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   -  The attack vector is through the application's web interface where user inputs are passed to the underlying database. An attacker could manipulate form fields or URL parameters to inject malicious SQL queries.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to access the application's web interface or any other input points that could be manipulated to inject SQL.
   -  The attacker does not need to be authenticated but might need to interact with the application as a patient or any user depending on the vulnerable code.
   - The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads, along with the ability to interpret response timings/behaviors.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content from sourcecodester.com describes a "Doctor's Appointment System" which is the vulnerable application mentioned in the CVE description on GitHub.
- The sourcecodester content contains a comment thread where the developer is assisting users with issues and also provides the link to the github repository for the vulnerable application.
- One of the comments highlights a potential SQL injection vulnerability in the patient/schedule.php file
- The provided content confirms that the Doctor's Appointment System version 1.0 is vulnerable to Blind SQL injection.
