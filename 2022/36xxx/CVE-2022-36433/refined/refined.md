Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36433:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `short_content` and `full_content` fields within the blog post creation functionality of the Amasty Blog Pro plugin for Magento 2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the blog post content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of administrative users who access the blog post creation, preview, or saved blog post interfaces. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking/cookie theft
    *   Stealing sensitive data from the admin panel
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Defacing the admin panel
    *   Executing unauthorized actions within the admin interface

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the blog post creation functionality in the Amasty Blog Pro plugin. Specifically, the `short_content` and `full_content` parameters are vulnerable.
*   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into these fields during blog post creation.
*   The injected code is executed when an administrator views the blog post either through the preview functionality or by saving and viewing the post.
*   Vulnerable endpoints are `POST /admin/amasty_blog/posts/preview/key/{some_key}/?isAjax=true` and `POST /admin/amasty_blog/posts/save/key/{some_key}/back/edit`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to create or edit blog posts within the Magento 2 administration panel. This implies the attacker would require administrator-level privileges or access that allows the user to manipulate blog posts.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Amasty Blog Pro versions prior to 2.10.5.
*   The fix is to update to version 2.10.5 or newer.
