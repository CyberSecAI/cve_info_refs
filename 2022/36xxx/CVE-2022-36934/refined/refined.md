- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An integer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs during an established video call.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate or participate in a video call with the vulnerable user. The exact nature of the malicious payload is not described, however it is likely triggered by a malformed video packet/data during the video call session.
