The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `EditMacList` function where the `sscanf` function is used with a greedy matching pattern `%[^;];`. This pattern reads input until a semicolon is encountered. If the input size exceeds the buffer `V23` size allocated on the stack, it leads to a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to unbounded data copy using `sscanf` with a vulnerable format string.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DOS) by overflowing the stack. Furthermore, by crafting specific payloads, a stable root shell without authorization can be obtained.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with the `CMD` parameter set to `EditMacList` and the `param` containing a long string to trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface. The attacker would need to know the router's IP address and be able to access it, likely requiring network access to the router's network.
