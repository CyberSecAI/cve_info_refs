Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is an SQL injection in the `del.php` file of the Library Management System. The `M_Id` parameter is vulnerable, as it is used directly in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically through the `M_Id` parameter in the `del.php` script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker can use SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database. In this specific example, the attacker is able to leak the database name.
*   **Data Modification:** The vulnerability allows modification of the database.
*   **Data Deletion:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `del.php` file.
*   **Manipulated `M_Id` Parameter:** The `M_Id` parameter within the POST data is manipulated with SQL injection code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Application Structure:** Basic knowledge of the application structure (specifically, the location of `del.php` and the function of the `M_Id` parameter).

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable parameter is `M_Id` within the POST request.
*   The payload used to exploit the vulnerability is `delete=&M_Id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`.
*   The vulnerable file is `/LMS/librarian/del.php`.
