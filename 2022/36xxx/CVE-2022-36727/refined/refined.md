**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially:
*   Extract sensitive data from the database
*   Modify data within the database
*   Potentially gain control of the server

**Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a crafted POST request to `/LMS/staff/delete.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `bookId` parameter.
