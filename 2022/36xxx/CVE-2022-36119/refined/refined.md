Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the security vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is not explicitly detailed, but the text mentions "new vulnerabilities" identified through in-depth testing by a security research organization. The specific nature of these vulnerabilities is kept private to prevent exploitation until patches are widely available. It can be inferred that the vulnerabilities relate to how the Blue Prism Enterprise platform handles certain operations or data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The text vaguely refers to "vulnerabilities" that can be exploited under "very limited conditions". The vulnerabilities are critical enough to warrant immediate action, but are not fully detailed for security purposes. The vulnerabilities are present in all versions of SS&C Blue Prism Enterprise starting at version 6.4. 
- The provided text indicates a vulnerability related to CyberArk, which was resolved in version 6.10.5 of Blue Prism Enterprise. This detail suggests the vulnerability might be related to how Blue Prism interacts with CyberArk for credential management or secure data handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to "critical consequences". While the specifics are not detailed, this suggests significant impacts such as unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vectors are not explicitly stated, however, the content suggests that the vulnerabilities can only be exploited under "very limited conditions" and would require "several complex pre-requisites."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Successful exploitation requires the attacker to meet certain complex pre-requisites. Although specific attacker capabilities or positions are not stated, they would need:
    - To bypass logically secured networks.
    - To gain access to devices that can interact with Blue Prism components (e.g. RDP connections to interactive clients).
    - The attacker would need to establish connections that are not part of the allow-listed (approved) connections.

**Mitigation:**

- Blue Prism advises users to adhere to their Robotic Operating Model (ROM) practices. These include:
    - Setting up Blue Prism components in a logically secured network.
    - Limiting access to approved devices.
    - Ensuring inbound and outbound connections are allow-listed.
- Security patches were developed for all versions of SS&C Blue Prism Enterprise starting at 6.4 and were included in version 7.1.
- Specific to the CyberArk vulnerability, the fix is included in version 6.10.5.

**Additional Notes:**
- Blue Prism Cloud is not affected as it was built following security best practices.
- Full vulnerability details are withheld until adequate protections are available.

This content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, but the details are still limited to protect against exploitation.
