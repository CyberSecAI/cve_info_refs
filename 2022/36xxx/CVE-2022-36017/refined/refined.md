Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from missing input validation within the `Requantize` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code did not properly check the rank (number of dimensions) of the `input_min`, `input_max`, `requested_output_min`, and `requested_output_max` tensors. It expected scalar tensors (rank 0), but would segfault if it received tensors with non-zero rank.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper checks on the dimensions of input tensors.
*   **Segfault:** The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault (segfault) when the `Requantize` operation receives tensors with incorrect ranks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The segfault can be exploited to trigger a denial-of-service attack, potentially crashing or making the affected TensorFlow application unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow model or input data that provides the `Requantize` operation with `input_min`, `input_max`, `requested_output_min`, and `requested_output_max` tensors with non-zero rank.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow application that uses the vulnerable `Requantize` operation. This may involve providing a malicious model, crafted data, or modifying the input to a susceptible function.

**Additional Details from the Patch Information:**

The provided commit (785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0) addresses this issue by adding explicit checks using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar()` to verify that the input tensors are indeed scalars (rank 0).

The commit also includes fixes for similar input validation issues in other quantization ops:

*   `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsOp`: checks if `min` and `max` tensors are scalar.
*   `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannelOp`: checks if `min` and `max` tensors are vectors (rank 1) with the correct size.
*   `QuantizedBiasAddOp`: checks if `min_input`, `max_input`, `min_bias`, and `max_bias` tensors are scalar.
*  `QuantizedInstanceNorm`: checks if `x_min` and `x_max` tensors are scalar.

This indicates that the vulnerability was part of a wider class of input validation issues related to quantization operations within TensorFlow.
