- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Amasty Blog Pro plugin for Magento 2 uses `eval` unsafely in its preview functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The unsafe use of `eval` allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can perform XSS attacks on admin panel users, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the generated preview application response, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed when an administrator previews the blog post.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the data that is used to generate the preview. This might require some level of access or knowledge about how the preview functionality works.
