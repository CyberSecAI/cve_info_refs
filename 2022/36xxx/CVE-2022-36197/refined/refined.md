  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the BigTree CMS's failure to sanitize uploaded PDF files, allowing an attacker to embed malicious JavaScript code within a PDF that is later executed in the context of the application when viewed by an administrator or regular user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary File Upload",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's context. This may lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions. The XSS payload is stored persistently within the PDF file, which can lead to repeated attacks on any user who views this malicious file within the BigTree CMS.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the file upload functionality of BigTree CMS. An attacker uploads a specially crafted PDF file containing a JavaScript payload. When a user (administrator or regular user) accesses the file, the embedded JavaScript is executed.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the authorization to upload files within the BigTree CMS. The attacker also needs the capability to generate a malicious PDF file with embedded JavaScript."
