# H3C Magic NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 has a stack overflow vulnerability

## Overview

* Manufacturer's website information：<https://www.h3c.com/>

### Product Information

H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router, the latest version of simulation overview：

[![image-20220720194826789](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/H3C%20NX18%20Plus/17/img/image-20220720194826789.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/H3C%20NX18%20Plus/17/img/image-20220720194826789.png)

## Vulnerability details

The H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router was found to have a stack overflow vulnerability in the UpdateMacClone function. An attacker can obtain a stable root shell through a carefully constructed payload.

[![image-20220720211305469](/Darry-lang1/vuln/raw/main/H3C/H3C%20NX18%20Plus/17/img/image-20220720211305469.png)](/Darry-lang1/vuln/blob/main/H3C/H3C%20NX18%20Plus/17/img/image-20220720211305469.png)

In the `UpdateMacClone` function, the `param` we entered is formatted using the `sscanf` function and in the form of `%s`. This greedy matching mechanism is unsafe. As long as the size of the data we enter is greater than the size of `V15` and less than 0x200, it will lead to stack overflow.

## Recurring vulnerabilities and POC

In order to reproduce the vulnerability, the following steps can be followed:

1. Boot the firmware by qemu-system or other ways (real machine)
2. Attack with the following POC attacks

```

The picture above shows the process information before we send poc.

In the picture above, we can see that the PID has changed since we sent the POC.

The picture above is the log information.

By calculating offsets, we can compile special data to refer to denial-of-service attacks(DOS).

Finally, you also can write exp to get a stable root shell without authorization.
