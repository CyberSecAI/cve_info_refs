- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `sprintf` function is used to format user-supplied input (`sPort`) into a buffer. The size of the format string is not checked which leads to a stack buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack buffer overflow due to unbounded `sprintf` usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A stack overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address, allowing an attacker to gain a root shell without authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint with an overly long string in the `sPort` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router, which implies network access to the device.
