Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `delete_student` function within the `/tss/classes/Master.php` file of the Simple Task Scheduling System v1.0. The `id` parameter passed to this function is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries.
- The `id` parameter is directly used in the SQL query within the `delete_student` function without proper escaping.
- The vulnerability uses `updatexml` function to extract database information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: The attacker can retrieve sensitive data from the database, like database name, user information, etc.
    - Data modification or deletion: The attacker could modify or delete data.
    - Potential complete database compromise, depending on database user privileges.
- In this specific example, the attacker is able to leak the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the HTTP POST request to `/tss/classes/Master.php?f=delete_student`.
- The vulnerable parameter is the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- No specific authentication is mentioned as a prerequisite for exploiting the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter and the vulnerable file.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `/tss/classes/Master.php` with the function `delete_student` that takes the `id` parameter via a POST request.
- The SQL injection payload used in the example is:
    `id=3' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
- The payload uses `updatexml` along with a subquery `(select database())` to extract the database name.
- The vulnerable application is using the `xmapp-php5.6` version.
