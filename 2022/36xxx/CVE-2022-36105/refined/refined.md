Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from observable timing discrepancies during user authentication attempts in TYPO3 CMS. By measuring the response time of the system, an attacker can differentiate between existing and non-existing user accounts. This is because the system would take longer to respond for existing user accounts due to password verification processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy:** The system's response time varies depending on whether a user account exists, making it possible to enumerate valid user accounts via timing analysis. This is a type of information disclosure vulnerability.
- **CWE-203: Information Exposure Through Discrepancy:**  (Although the main CWE identified was 208, the description and impact align with CWE-203 as well, making it a more suitable weakness.) This weakness refers to the system providing different responses based on the provided input, in this case the existence of a user account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Enumeration:** An attacker can identify valid usernames within the system without needing valid credentials.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leaks information about the system by disclosing the presence of user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the network by sending authentication requests and measuring response times.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any prior access or valid user account.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any interaction from legitimate users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable TYPO3 system.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was addressed by introducing `MimicServiceInterface::mimicAuthUser`. This interface is implemented by authentication services to simulate the processing time that would normally occur during valid authentication requests, even for invalid usernames. This makes the response times similar regardless of whether a username is valid or not.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of TYPO3 CMS (7.0.0 to 11.5.15).
- Patched versions include 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32, and 11.5.16.
- The CVSS score is 4.9 (Moderate).
