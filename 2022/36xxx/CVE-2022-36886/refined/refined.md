Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36886:

**CVE-2022-36886**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The External Monitor Job Type Plugin does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF). The vulnerability arises because the plugin's HTTP endpoint for creating runs of external jobs can be accessed using GET requests, without requiring a POST request.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can create runs of external jobs, potentially leading to denial of service or other unwanted actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page or link that, when visited by a logged-in Jenkins user, triggers a request to the vulnerable endpoint, creating runs of an external job. The user's browser will automatically send the necessary credentials, allowing the attacker to bypass the CSRF protection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in Jenkins user into visiting a malicious web page or clicking a malicious link. No specific privileges within Jenkins are needed, but the user needs to have an active session with the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects External Monitor Job Type Plugin versions 191.v363d0d1efdf8 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in version 192.ve979ca\_8b\_3ccd, which requires POST requests for the affected endpoint.
*   The CVSS score is medium, as the impact is limited to the creation of unwanted external job runs.
