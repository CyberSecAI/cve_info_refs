Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in relation to CVE-2022-36056:

**Summary of Vulnerabilities**

The provided content details four vulnerabilities related to `cosign verify-blob`, where the tool incorrectly verifies artifacts under certain conditions:

1.  **Bundle Mismatch Causes Invalid Verification:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Cosign does not verify if the Rekor bundle payload references the provided blob during bundle verification.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper verification of the Rekor bundle content.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can craft a bundle with a mismatched Rekor entry that passes verification, allowing for the acceptance of invalid signatures.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulation of cosign bundle files.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to create or modify Cosign bundles.

2.  **Certificate Identities Are Not Checked in Some Cases:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Cosign ignores certificate email and issuer when verifying Rekor bundles with identity flags. GitHub Actions identity is never checked with bundle verification.
    *   **Weakness:**  Failure to properly validate certificate identities against provided flags.
    *  **Impact:**  Bypassing identity verification, allowing forgeries with certificates that don't match expected identities.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Use of crafted certificates with identity mismatches when providing offline Rekor bundles.
    *  **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or obtain a certificate with a mismatched identity.

3.  **Invalid Rekor Bundle Without the Experimental Flag Results in Successful Verification:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Cosign falls back to online Rekor log inclusion check without the experimental flag. This check is flawed and results in early exit and successful verification.
    *  **Weakness:**  Flawed fallback mechanism for verifying Rekor bundles.
    *   **Impact:**  Invalid Rekor bundles are accepted as valid.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Provision of invalid Rekor bundles during offline verification.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Ability to create or modify Cosign bundles to be invalid.

4.  **Invalid Transparency Log Entry Results in Successful Verification:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  Cosign exits early and succeeds unconditionally if an invalid transparency log entry is returned.
    *   **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation of transparency log entries fetched from Rekor.
    *   **Impact:** Invalid entries from the Rekor log will pass verification.
    *  **Attack Vector:**  Manipulation of Rekor log entries (if attacker can compromise Rekor).
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker would need to be in a position to manipulate Rekor to return crafted invalid entries.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Patches:** All vulnerabilities are fixed in Cosign version `1.12.0`.
*   **Workarounds:** Only Vulnerability 1 has a workaround (by extracting the signature and certificate and not using the bundle). The rest of the vulnerabilities do not have viable workarounds other than updating.
*   **Severity:**  Rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 5.5. The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low
*  **Privileges Required:** Low
*   **Scope:** Unchanged.
*   **Integrity:** High
*   **Confidentiality and Availability:** None
*   **Credits:** codysoyland, asraa, haydentherapper are credited with the discovery and analysis of these vulnerabilities.
*  The commit log `80b79ed` includes code changes to fix the issues.
