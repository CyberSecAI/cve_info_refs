Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the PHP code of the "edoc-doctor-appointment-system". Specifically, user-supplied data from HTTP GET requests is directly incorporated into SQL queries without adequate escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in several files:
    - `/patient/doctors.php`
    - `/patient/booking.php`
    - `/patient/settings.php`
- The vulnerability is present due to the failure to sanitize user input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database, potentially including patient information, doctor details, and administrative credentials.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
- **Account Takeover:** Attackers may be able to use the vulnerability to escalate privileges and gain access to administrative accounts.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution (Possible):** In some scenarios, advanced SQL injection techniques could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the server, though this is not explicitly stated in the provided document.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerabilities are triggered through specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable PHP files.
- **Manipulated URL Parameters:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into the `id` parameters, and `action` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** Attackers need a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the malicious injection payloads.
- **Web Browser or HTTP Client:** The attacker needs a web browser or a tool like Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests.

**Specific Vulnerability Details:**

1.  **`/patient/doctors.php` (Blind SQLi)**
    *   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
    *   **Attack Type:** Blind SQL injection
    *   **Payload Example:**  `http://ip/patient/doctors.php?action=view&id=1' AND (SELECT 7788 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))gIPf)-- MVmI`
    *  SQLmap is used to detect the vulnerability using a crafted request.
2.  **`/patient/booking.php` (SQLi)**
    *   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
    *   **Attack Types:** Boolean-based blind, Error-based, Time-based blind, UNION query
    *  SQLmap is used to detect the vulnerability using a crafted request.
3.  **`/patient/settings.php` (SQLi)**
    *   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `id`
    *   **Attack Types:** Boolean-based blind, Error-based, Time-based blind, UNION query
    *  SQLmap is used to detect the vulnerability using a crafted request.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided document uses SQLmap to confirm the existence and type of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- The document provides step-by-step instructions and screenshots on how to exploit these vulnerabilities using Burp Suite and SQLmap, making it a proof of concept.
- The document states that the vulnerable application is `edoc-doctor-appointment-system v1.0.1`.
- The application is based on PHP and uses MySQL.
- The document references a github repository `https://github.com/HashenUdara/edoc-doctor-appointment-system`
