| XXL-JOB is a distributed task scheduling framework, the core design goal is to develop quickly, learning simple, lightweight, easy to expand. Is now open source and access to a number of companies online product line. <https://www.xuxueli.com/xxl-job/en/> <https://github.com/xuxueli/xxl-job/>  A Escalation of Privileges vulnerability was discoverde in the opensource CMS.OK,follow my step see how to achieve the vulnerability!  1、You need to login the system(default admin account:admin/123456),you'll see six functions. 2、Next,click the "user management(用户管理)"function and create a low Privilege user named test. 3、Logout the admin account and login with test account.we'll find there has only four functions. 4、If we add "/jobgroup" to the URL end ,we can see the fifth function "Executor management(执行器管理)",even edit it!  So,we could achieve the vulnerability by four steps and execute admin function with low Privilege account. |
