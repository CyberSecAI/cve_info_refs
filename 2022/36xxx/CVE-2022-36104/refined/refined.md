{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2022-36104",
    "Description": "TYPO3 CMS is susceptible to denial of service. Requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error handler which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.",
    "Root cause": "A regression during TYPO3 v11 development reintroduced a vulnerability where an inaccessible error page amplified denial-of-service scenarios, causing recursive calls.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-405: Insufficient Resource Consumption",
      "CWE-674: Improper Handling of Recursion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by exhausting server resources.",
    "Attack vector": "Network-based attacks by requesting invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No specific capabilities or positions are required, the attacker only needs to send HTTP requests."
