The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `SetAPWifiorLedInfoById` function. The function uses `sscanf` with a `%[^;]` format specifier to parse user-supplied input. This greedy matching mechanism, combined with insufficient bounds checking, causes a stack buffer overflow. Specifically, if the input string provided through the `param` parameter in the POST request is larger than the buffer `V12`, a stack overflow occurs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow. The `sscanf` function, when used with a greedy matching specifier like `%[^;]` without proper size limitations, allows an attacker to write data beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve a denial-of-service (DoS) and potentially obtain a stable root shell. The provided information suggests the possibility of arbitrary code execution by crafting a specific payload to overwrite return addresses on the stack.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint. The `CMD` parameter is set to `SetAPWifiorLedInfoById`, and the `param` parameter contains a string that triggers the stack overflow by exceeding the buffer size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. No authentication seems to be required initially to trigger the overflow, however, the poc sends a cookie suggesting some prior login may be needed for a full exploit. The attacker is required to send crafted requests with the malicious payload that triggers the stack overflow vulnerability.
