Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-36881:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36881

**Vulnerability:** Missing SSH host key verification

**Affected Plugin:** Git client Plugin

**Affected Versions:** 3.11.0 and earlier

**Root Cause:** The Git client plugin does not perform SSH host key verification when connecting to Git repositories via SSH.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of SSH host key verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can be performed to intercept SSH connections to Git repositories. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain access to the repository or manipulate the code being checked out.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack by intercepting the network connection between the Jenkins server and the Git repository server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the Git repository server. This could be on the local network or on an internet route.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix in Git client Plugin 3.11.1 provides configuration strategies for host key verification, allowing administrators to select the most suitable option for their security needs.
