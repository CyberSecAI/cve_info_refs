Look at the code  The specific detection logic is in the filter method in SecurityUtil.java, so let's look at the code logic here  Briefly, the main thing here is to get the values of the request parameters, and then pass them one by one to the following detection logic  Since we just prompted for an XSS attack, we will follow directly into the method antixss to see the specific implementation logic Next you will come to Antixss.Java  ``` src/main/java/com/cloudwebsoft/framework/security/AntiXSS.java  ```  The antiXSS method is called by passing in the html to be detected and a true  Follow directly in to see  Check the \_antiXSS method, where the content is passed in is the content to be detected  Here is the specific detection logic, but I'm only looking at the `stripScriptTag` method here, because it is the content inside this method that is detected, and our focus is only on what parameters are detected  Mainly by means of regularity and case-insensitive because of `CASE_INSENSITIVE`  Pull the following when you can see, in fact, and or sleep is filtered, create a new test class, and adjust it to know  Remove AND  The statement is normal, put back and remove sleep, the statement is normal, so since this is the case, replace and with &&, you can  statement returns normally, then after returning here  Returning to SecurityUtil.java, it will enter the logic of SQL injection, following the `isValidSqlParam` method  Follow the `sql_inj` method  We have already bypassed the detection of and and need to bypass the code logic in the second box  The main logic here is to separate inj\_str using `|`, which will generate a list to inj\_stra[], and then iterate through the list, each loop will use the indexOf method to determine whether the value in inj\_stra[i] is in str, that is, if indexOf returns > 0 value exists, and vice versa, it does not exist, here you can also write a class tuned   In the sixth loop, which is when select is detected, then it is obvious that you need to bypass select Here I was going to try to use  ``` && extractvalue(1,concat('~',database())) ```  Unfortunately, `'~'` will be detected as XSS, so this method does not work  The && here needs to be converted to url encoding, otherwise this request will report 400  So we can only think of ways to select this keyword, here is a bypass of the payload  ``` id+%26%26+(/*!%53eLEct*/+1+FROM+(/*!%53eLEct*/(sleep(5)))a) ```  Tips: Here just by looking at the screenshot you may think that you can bypass it with SELECT capitalization, but in fact it will be converted to lowercase before calling the `sql_inj` method  So there is no way to capitalize to bypass  ``` POST /oa/visual/moduleList.do?op=&code=personbasic&orderBy=id+%26%26+(/*!%53eLEct*/+1+FROM+(/*!%53eLEct*/(sleep(5)))a)&sort=desc&unitCode=& HTTP/1.1 Host: 172.16.140.176:8088 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0 Accept: */* Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.8,zh-TW;q=0.7,zh-HK;q=0.5,en-US;q=0.3,en;q=0.2 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: close Cookie: JSESSIONID=A4CD4E79F3B246F5268600DDF907FA54; skincode=lte; name=admin; pwd=p5Bx7jxXNGCCEsQLv/rG4w==; cwbbs.auth=LkPkBkEkAkNmJmHmHhEmNmHmHmPmBmPmPmOhOhKmMmMhJlDlDiGlAlMlCiDiNlIiJlIlMlMlPlNl Content-Length: 15  page=2&limit=20 ``` Function implementation entrance First will get the get parameter code, if the code parameter is empty, then get the Get parameter moduleCode and assign it to code, if there is no moduleCode in the get parameter, then get the formCode and copy it to code, here the code parameter passed in is personbasic  Continue to the next page  Here is the OA developer's own implementation of the SQLBuilder class   Follow this method  Follow such as getModuleListSqlAndUrlStr method, then a sql str will be returned, continue down the line is the place that causes SQL injection  Follow up this listResult method  The statements will then be spelled out in the middle  The executeQuery statement is then executed  The difference between the above and the SQL statement is that one is the count spliced in and the other is the original passed in  This is followed by a return, which is executed here with a 5-second wait, so it causes an injection |
