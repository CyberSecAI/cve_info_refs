The provided content is related to CVE-2022-36605.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection vulnerability in the `orderBy` GET parameter within the `moduleList.do` endpoint. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before incorporating it into a SQL query.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection:  The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `orderBy` parameter in `moduleList.do`.

**Impact:**
- The attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract database information or perform other malicious actions via SQL injection, as demonstrated by the `sleep(5)` injection to cause a delay in response.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET parameter: The `orderBy` parameter in a GET request to `moduleList.do` is the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges and can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted GET request to the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The application implements a filter called `SecurityUtil.java` to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- The XSS detection logic is in `AntiXSS.java`.
- The SQL injection detection is in the `sql_inj` method of `SecurityUtil.java`.
- The application attempts to block keywords like `and`, `or`, and `sleep` for XSS protection and `select` for SQL injection.
- The attacker bypasses these filters by using `&&` instead of `and` and using `/*!%53eLEct*/` in place of `select`.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of the `executeQuery` method after the user-supplied parameters are incorporated into SQL query.
