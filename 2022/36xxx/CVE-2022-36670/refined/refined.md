The provided content describes a vulnerability in PCProtect Antivirus (prior to version 5.17.470) and IObit Malware Fighter 9.2 on Windows systems. It appears this content is related to CVE-2022-36670 as it is mentioned at the end of the article.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is insufficient anti-tampering protection of the services provided by PCProtect Antivirus and IObit Malware Fighter. This allows users with administrator privileges to modify or disable these security services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   Lack of tamper protection on service registry keys.
-   Vulnerable registry keys for PCProtect: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SecurityService`
-   Vulnerable registry keys for IObit Malware Fighter:
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\AdvancedSystemCareService15`
    `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IMFservice`

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   Disabling PCProtect Antivirus and IObit Malware Fighter, leaving the system unprotected.
-   Privilege escalation to SYSTEM level by modifying service parameters to point to a malicious executable, which can then run with SYSTEM privileges. This allows an attacker to establish persistence on the system.
-   Ability to launch arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

-   Local access to the machine with administrator privileges is required.
-   Modification of service registry keys to disable the service or point to a malicious executable.
-   Command line manipulation of registry keys using `reg delete` and `reg add` commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   Attacker must have local administrator privileges on the target machine.
-   Ability to modify the registry (add, delete or change keys/values).
-   Ability to create and execute a malicious payload (e.g., via msfvenom).
