Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36061:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue where read-only calls between smart contracts can inadvertently modify the state of the called contract. Specifically, if contract A calls contract B in read-only mode, any state changes made by contract B during that call are not rolled back, as they should be in a true read-only scenario.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect handling of read-only calls:** The core issue is that the system does not properly enforce the read-only nature of cross-contract calls, allowing state modifications to occur when they should be prohibited.
- **State alteration during read-only calls:** The system does not correctly prevent state changes in the called contract when the call originates as a read-only operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unexpected state changes:** The vulnerability can lead to contract states being modified in ways not intended by the smart contract developers, potentially breaking the logic and functionality of the contracts.
- **Unintended effects:** The unintended state changes could have various consequences, including incorrect balances, disrupted contract interactions, and other logical errors in the smart contract system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Inter-contract calls:** The vulnerability is exploited through interactions between smart contracts. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by initiating a read-only call from one contract to another.
- **Specifically crafted smart contracts:** Attackers would need to deploy and utilize smart contracts designed to exploit this behavior, by making read-only calls that cause modifications in the target smart contracts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to deploy smart contracts:** Attackers need the ability to deploy smart contracts on the affected network.
- **Ability to initiate contract calls:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate calls between their deployed contracts.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable contracts:**  Attackers need to know how to structure their calls to trigger the specific flaw in the VM.
