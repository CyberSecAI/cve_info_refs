Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insufficient UI warning provided by AVEVA Edge when handling APP files. The application allows the execution of arbitrary Visual Basic scripts embedded within these files. The user interface fails to adequately warn users about the potential danger of opening such files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient UI Warning:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient warning to the user about the potential risks associated with opening APP files.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution via Scripting:**  The vulnerability arises from the ability to embed and execute arbitrary Visual Basic scripts within APP files.
*   **Lack of input validation:** The application does not sufficiently validate the contents of the APP files, thus allowing arbitrary script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the AVEVA Edge process.
*   **Full Control of the Affected System:** Because the code executes within the context of the application, it would likely have the same rights as the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious APP Files:** Attackers can craft malicious APP files containing harmful Visual Basic scripts.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically the user opening a malicious APP file or visiting a malicious page that triggers the download and execution of such a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious APP Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify APP files to include their malicious scripts.
*   **Ability to Entice a User to Open a Malicious File:**  The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to open a malicious APP file or visit a malicious site. This could be through social engineering, malicious websites or other methods.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of APP files
*   The vulnerability is addressed in a security update
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Aaron Ferber of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative
*   AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP1 and all prior versions are affected by the vulnerability
*   CVE-2022-36970 is associated with CWE-357
