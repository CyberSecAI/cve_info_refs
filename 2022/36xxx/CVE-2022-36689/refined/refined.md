Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root Cause:** The `month` parameter in the `/isms/admin/?page=reports/waste` URL is vulnerable to SQL injection. The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input sanitization or validation for the `month` parameter.
- Direct use of the user-provided `month` parameter in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to:
   - Access sensitive database information, such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data.
   - Modify or delete data in the database.
   - Execute arbitrary commands on the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges.
- In this specific case, the attacker is able to retrieve the database name.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL with a crafted `month` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter (`month`) and the vulnerable URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Payload:**
The provided payload is:

```
/isms/admin/?page=reports/waste&month=2022-07%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,database(),9,10--+
```
This payload injects a SQL `UNION` statement that selects the database name by injecting  `database()` function, alongside other dummy values for columns not being selected. This demonstrates the ability to extract data from the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerable system is "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0 by oretnom23".
- The database name, `isms_db`, was revealed by the SQL injection.
- The exploit was tested on the URL: `/isms/admin/?page=reports/waste&month=`
