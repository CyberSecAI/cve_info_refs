# Redis string pattern matching can be abused to achieve Denial of Service

Moderate

[yossigo](/yossigo)
published
GHSA-jr7j-rfj5-8xqv
Feb 28, 2023

## Package

Redis
(N/A)

## Affected versions

All versions

## Patched versions

6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9

## Description

### Impact

Authenticated users can use string matching commands (like `SCAN` or `KEYS`) with a specially crafted pattern to trigger a denial-of-service attack on Redis, causing it to hang and consume 100% CPU time.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.0.18, 6.2.11, 7.0.9.

### Credit

The issue has been identified by Tom Levy.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)
* Email us at redis@redis.io

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
