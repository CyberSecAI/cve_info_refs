Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36021:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the inefficient implementation of string pattern matching within Redis, specifically how it handles the `*` wildcard character. The pattern matching algorithm exhibited exponential time complexity when processing specific pathological patterns which led to high CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The string matching logic had an exponential time complexity for certain input patterns.
- **Denial of Service:** The inefficient pattern matching could be exploited to cause a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** A specially crafted pattern used with string matching commands (e.g., `SCAN`, `KEYS`) can cause Redis to hang and consume 100% CPU time. This renders the Redis instance unavailable, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **String Matching Commands:** Exploitation occurs through Redis commands that use string matching, such as `SCAN` or `KEYS`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Redis server.
- **Ability to execute commands:** The attacker must be able to send commands to the Redis server, including those that perform string pattern matching.
