Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-36090.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper authorization check for inactive users within the XWiki platform, specifically in the `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-oldcore` component. Inactive users were still being authenticated and set in the standard context, and the checks for disabled users were only properly enforced in a limited number of areas (specifically `XWiki#prepareDocuments`). This left other areas, such as the REST API, vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The primary weakness is the lack of consistent authorization checks for inactive users across the platform. This allowed inactive users to bypass intended restrictions.
- **Inconsistent Handling of Inactive Users:** Inactive users were not consistently treated as unauthorized. They were still being authenticated, and the system failed to properly distinguish them from active users in many areas.
- **REST API Vulnerability:** The REST API lacked proper checks for inactive users, which allowed them to perform actions they should not have been authorized to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An inactive user could potentially escalate their privileges by making REST calls to modify their status (e.g. enabling themselves), effectively bypassing the intended security controls.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** Inactive users could perform unauthorized actions in extensions or other parts of the system where proper checks were not in place.
- **Data manipulation:** An inactive user could use the REST API to modify data (e.g. enabling themselves).
- **Access to protected resources:** Inactive users could potentially access protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network using REST API calls or other HTTP requests.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a user that has been marked as inactive or disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Account:** The attacker needs a user account on the XWiki platform that has been disabled or is awaiting email activation.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the XWiki server, typically using the REST API or other web interfaces.
- **Basic Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how the XWiki REST API or other components work to craft the appropriate requests.
