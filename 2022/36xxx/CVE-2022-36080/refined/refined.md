Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36080:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of HTML content generated from markdown files, leading to a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application was converting markdown files to HTML using `pypandoc`, which could include user-controlled content. Without proper sanitization, malicious scripts could be embedded in the markdown and executed when the resulting HTML was rendered in a user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability (CWE-79). The application failed to sanitize the HTML generated from user-provided markdown, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:

*   Capture user's session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   Execute malicious JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This could be used to redirect the user to a malicious site, perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive data, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is the inclusion of malicious HTML/JavaScript code within markdown files. These files are then processed by the application using `pypandoc`. The vulnerable code was present in the `wiki.py` file, where markdown files are converted to HTML.
*   An attacker could craft a markdown file containing malicious scripts and upload it to the server (or potentially modify existing files, depending on write access). When a user accesses the page displaying the converted HTML, the malicious script would execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify markdown files that are processed by the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker can be a malicious user who has permissions to edit markdown files.
*   The attacker may also need to be able to persuade a victim to visit the page with the malicious script, if they do not have permissions to edit files directly.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in `wikmd` versions prior to 1.7.0.
*   The fix implemented in version 1.7.1 involved using `lxml.html.clean.clean_html` to sanitize the generated HTML before serving it to the user. This sanitization step removes potentially malicious code.
*   The commit `259412c47d64d5b85980f95345179fbf05927798` introduces the fix, adding the `clean_html()` function after the markdown to HTML conversion.
*   The vulnerability is specific to the `wiki.py` file, which handles the markdown to HTML conversion.
