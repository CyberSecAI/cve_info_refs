Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36745:

**1. Verification:**

   - The provided content directly references CVE-2022-36745 and CVE-2022-36746, linking them to a specific commit in the LibreNMS project.
   - The CVE description in the GitHub Advisory database for CVE-2022-36745 indicates a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `print-customoid.php` component of LibreNMS.
   - This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

   - The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `print-customoid.php` file. Specifically, the page number parameter (`$_POST['page_num']`) was not correctly validated and sanitized before being used in the application.
   - This allowed a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page via the page number.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

   - The primary vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.
   - The code in `print-customoid.php`  failed to sanitize user-controlled input, which allowed the injection of malicious code.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

   - Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session when viewing a LibreNMS page using `print-customoid.php`.
   - This could lead to various malicious activities, including:
      - Session hijacking
      - Stealing sensitive information
      - Defacing the webpage
      - Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**5. Attack vectors:**

   - The attack vector is a network-based attack using HTTP POST requests to the `print-customoid.php` endpoint.
   - Specifically, the attacker injects the malicious script via the `page_num` parameter.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable LibreNMS instance.
   - No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability can be exploited via a normal user account.
   - The attacker needs some way to get a victim user to visit a link that executes their crafted malicious payload.

**7. Patch details:**

   - The vulnerability was fixed by casting the `$_POST['page_num']` value to an integer using `intval()`. This prevents the injection of Javascript via this parameter.
   - The fix can be found in commit `e5c91a0` of the librenms/librenms repository which is linked in the GitHub advisory.

**Summary:**

The provided content details a moderate severity XSS vulnerability (CVE-2022-36745) in LibreNMS's `print-customoid.php` file. The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of the `page_num` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript. The impact is a compromised user session and potential data theft or other malicious actions. The vulnerability was addressed by casting the page number to integer, preventing injection.
