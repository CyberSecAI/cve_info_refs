  "Verified": true,

    {
      "ID": "CVE-2022-36271",
      "Root cause": "The application is vulnerable to DLL hijacking. Specifically, the application is missing the 'iertutil.dll' file. This allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL with the same name in the application's execution path, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
      "Vulnerability": [
        "DLL Hijacking"
      ],
      "Impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with administrative privileges. The malicious DLL can also be used to establish persistence on the victim machine.",
      "Attack vector": "The attacker needs to place a malicious 'iertutil.dll' in the same directory as the vulnerable executable or a directory that the application searches during DLL loading.",
      "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to write files to the filesystem where the vulnerable application is located or a location it searches for DLL files."
