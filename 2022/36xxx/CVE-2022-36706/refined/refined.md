The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `id` parameter of the `manage_stockout.php` script.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The `id` parameter in the `manage_stockout.php` script is directly used in an SQL query without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting SQL queries to leak data.
- Database manipulation: An attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `manage_stockout.php` with a specially crafted `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- No prior authentication or special privileges are explicitly mentioned in the provided content.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable file: `/isms/admin/stocks/manage_stockout.php`
- Vulnerable parameter: `id`
- Payload example: `/isms/admin/stocks/manage_stockout.php?id=3' and length(database()) = 7--+`
- The example payload uses a boolean-based blind SQL injection technique to determine the length of the database name. The response changes based on whether the length condition is true or false
