Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-36280:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds memory write vulnerability exists in the `vmwgfx` driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `vmw_kms_cursor_snoop` function within `vmwgfx_kms.c`.
- Specifically, the `memcpy` operation in the vulnerable code does not properly validate the length of the copy, leading to out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local, unprivileged user can exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service (system crash).
- The out-of-bounds write corrupts memory, resulting in a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending crafted ioctl() calls to the `/dev/dri/renderD128` (or similar) device file used to communicate with the VMware graphics driver (`vmwgfx` module).
- Exploitation may involve a specifically crafted userland program to exercise the vulnerable ioctl, as indicated by the poc file in the bugzilla report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to open and send ioctls to the graphics device file, which may be possible for unprivileged users on some distributions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in upstream commit `4cf949c7fafe` ("drm/vmwgfx: Validate the box size for the snooped cursor").
- The issue was reported by ziming zhang (@ezrak1e) from Ant Group Light-Year Security Lab.
- The fix involves validating the `box` size before the `memcpy` operation to prevent writing past allocated memory.
