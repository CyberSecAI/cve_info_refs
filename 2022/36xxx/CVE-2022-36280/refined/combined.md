    the Intel iSMT SMBus 2.0 host controller driver may result in
    denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-3424

    Zheng Wang and Zhuorao Yang reported a flaw in the SGI GRU driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  On systems where this driver
    is used, a local user can explit this for denial of service (crash
    or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3545

    It was discovered that the Netronome Flow Processor (NFP) driver
    contained a use-after-free flaw in area_cache_get(), which may
    result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-3707

    Zheng Wang reported a flaw in the i915 graphics driver's
    virtualisation (GVT-g) support that could lead to a double-free.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2873

    Zheyu Ma discovered that an out-of-bounds memory access flaw in the
    Intel iSMT SMBus 2.0 host controller driver may result in denial of
    service (system crash).

CVE-2022-3545

    It was discovered that the Netronome Flow Processor (NFP) driver
    contained a use-after-free flaw in area_cache_get(), which may
    result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-3623

    A race condition when looking up a CONT-PTE/PMD size hugetlb page
    may result in denial of service or an information leak.

CVE-2022-4696

    A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in the io_uring
    subsystem.

CVE-2022-36280

    An out-of-bounds memory write vulnerability was discovered in the
    vmwgfx driver, which may allow a local unprivileged user to cause a
    denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-41218

    Hyunwoo Kim reported a use-after-free flaw in the Media DVB core
    subsystem caused by refcount races, which may allow a local user to
    cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.

CVE-2022-45934

    An integer overflow in l2cap_config_req() in the Bluetooth subsystem
    was discovered, which may allow a physically proximate attacker to
    cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2022-47929

    Frederick Lawler reported a NULL pointer dereference in the traffic
    control subsystem allowing an unprivileged user to cause a denial of
    service by setting up a specially crafted traffic control
    configuration.

CVE-2023-0179

    Davide Ornaghi discovered incorrect arithmetics when fetching VLAN
    header bits in the netfilter subsystem, allowing a local user to
    leak stack and heap addresses or potentially local privilege
    escalation to root.

CVE-2023-0266

    A use-after-free flaw in the sound subsystem due to missing locking
    may result in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2023-0394

    Kyle Zeng discovered a NULL pointer dereference flaw in
    rawv6_push_pending_frames() in the network subsystem allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service (system crash).

CVE-2023-23454

    Kyle Zeng reported that the Class Based Queueing (CBQ) network
    scheduler was prone to denial of service due to interpreting
    classification results before checking the classification
    return code.

CVE-2023-23455

    Kyle Zeng reported that the ATM Virtual Circuits (ATM) network
    scheduler was prone to a denial of service due to interpreting
    classification results before checking the classification
    return code.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.162-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
