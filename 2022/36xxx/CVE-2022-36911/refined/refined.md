Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36911:

**CVE-2022-36911:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `openstack-heat` plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation. Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** Attackers with `Overall/Read` permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL.
    *  **CSRF vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, allowing for CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with `Overall/Read` permissions can connect to an arbitrary URL.
    *   Through CSRF, an attacker could potentially trigger actions on the Jenkins instance via a crafted request.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permissions
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious request to the vulnerable form validation method in the plugin to perform actions on the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to have `Overall/Read` permissions on the Jenkins instance.
    *  The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim user to trigger the crafted malicious request (for CSRF).

**Summary:**
The `openstack-heat` plugin is vulnerable to CSRF and missing permission checks.  An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can connect to an arbitrary URL and, through CSRF, could be able to trick a user into making actions on the Jenkins instance.
