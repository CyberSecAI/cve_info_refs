Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-36961:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in a component of the SolarWinds Orion Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to manipulate SQL queries executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker could gain higher levels of access within the system than they are authorized to have.
- Remote Code Execution: The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via SQL injection. The specific vulnerable component is not stated, but it's within the Orion Platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated attacker. The attacker needs valid credentials to access the affected Orion Platform instance.
- The attacker must be able to send malicious SQL queries to the vulnerable component.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.0.
- The vulnerability affects Orion Platform versions 2022.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was addressed in SolarWinds Platform 2022.3.
- The CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  - **AV:A** (Attack Vector: Adjacent): The attacker must be on the same network segment as the target.
  - **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low): The attack is relatively easy to perform.
  - **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low): The attacker needs low-level privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
  - **UI:N** (User Interaction: None): No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
  - **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged): An exploited vulnerability cannot affect resources beyond its security scope.
  - **C:H** (Confidentiality: High): There is a high impact on confidentiality, meaning sensitive information could be exposed.
  - **I:H** (Integrity: High): There is a high impact on integrity, meaning data could be modified or corrupted.
  - **A:H** (Availability: High): There is a high impact on availability, meaning the system could become unavailable.
