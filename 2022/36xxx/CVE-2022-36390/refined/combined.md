I stumbled upon Event Calendar while searching for a reliable calendar plugin for my WordPress site, and I couldn’t be happier with my discovery.
Right off the bat, I was impressed by how easy it was to set up and customize the calendar to fit my needs. Even as someone with limited technical skills, I found the interface intuitive and straightforward to navigate.
What truly sets Event Calendar apart, though, is their exceptional tech support. I had run into a problem, their team was quick to respond and incredibly helpful in resolving y issue. Their dedication to customer satisfaction is truly commendable.
I also appreciate the flexibility Event Calendar offers. With a range of customizable options, I’ve been able to tailor the calendar to match the look and feel of my website perfectly.
Overall, Event Calendar has exceeded my expectations in every way. It’s a reliable, user-friendly solution for anyone in need of a quality calendar plugin for their WordPress site. If you’re in the market for such a tool, I can’t recommend Event Calendar highly enough.

Complex and unclear to use. Installed and created a test event, but can’t see how to show a calendar on a webpage. Looked for FAQs and User Manual but the links go to “Page can’t be accessed”. No response to reports to Support. Gave up and used another plugin.

The thing just worked beautifully. My calendar looked great, it was easy to set up, no fuss no muss, no “modify templates”, no “use this extension or add-on” to do anything worth doing. Thank you, guys!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
