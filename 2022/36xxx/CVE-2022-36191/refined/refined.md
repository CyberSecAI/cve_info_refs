Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the function `gf_isom_dovi_config_get` located in `isomedia/avc_ext.c`. The issue occurs at line 2490, specifically when accessing `entry->dovi_config` without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The code attempts to read from a memory location pointed to by `entry->dovi_config` without verifying if `dovi_config` is valid (i.e., not NULL). This leads to a read operation on an invalid memory address, resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash of the application (MP4Box) due to the heap-buffer-overflow. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, depending on the surrounding memory layout and the possibility of overwriting adjacent data structures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious MP4 file:** An attacker can craft a malicious MP4 file containing a specific "dovi config" that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the `MP4Box` tool. This is evident from the crash command provided: `./MP4Box -info poc1`, where `poc1` is the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide a crafted MP4 file:** The attacker needs the capability to create or modify an MP4 file to include a specific malformed DOVI configuration that will trigger the vulnerability.
- **Target uses MP4Box/GPAC:** The attacker needs a target system that uses the vulnerable version of GPAC and its MP4Box tool to process the crafted MP4 file.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided information includes a crash log using AddressSanitizer showing a read of size 8 at a wild pointer.
- The vulnerability is related to a previous issue ([\#1846](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/issues/1846)), suggesting a recurring pattern of similar vulnerabilities within the codebase.
- A patch has been committed (`fef6242`) to address the issue.
- Debian Security Advisory DSA-5411-1 lists this CVE as part of multiple vulnerabilities fixed in the updated package.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to a lack of proper null-pointer checking before accessing the `dovi_config` member in a sample entry, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow when processing specially crafted MP4 files.
