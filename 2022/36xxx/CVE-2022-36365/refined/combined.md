How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

### [Amazing plugin, just needed a CSS snippet to make it more fun](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/amazing-plugin-just-needed-a-css-snippet-to-make-it-more-fun/)

Thank you for this AMAZING plugin! It works really well.
I made the CSS snippet below to customize it a little bit. Btw, I noticed that when you’re filling a word, and then, erase a letter, the row is still green. With this snippet, the row is yellow so you know something’s wrong.
Hope this snippet will be useful for someone else! 🙂

Feature request: It would be great if, when you write the letters, you didn’t have to click ENTER to move to the next box. Right after you write a letter, you should be automatically redirected to the next box.
Thank you so much for this plugin!
Cheers,

Perfect for making crossword puzzles. I appreciate plugins like this which are completely contained within the wordpress site, as opposed to so many fake plugins that only hyperlink you to some other site where the actual puzzle is. Thanks for making and sharing!

Setup the crossword settings and added to my page. Only the clues showed up on the page, the actual crossword puzzle didn’t appear. Inspecting it I found there were empty script and style tags where the shortcode was supposed to be loading stuff, but it just wasn’t being loaded on the page.

I REALLY need Crosswords for our students, I wish there was a paid version of this plugin so they could include some characteristics I would like to have.
I would happily pay for this plugin, I’ve paid for others that don’t really work.
Thanks, great job, I hope you can keep it up.
