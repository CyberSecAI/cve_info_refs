Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36916:

**CVE-2022-36916**

*   **Vulnerability:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and missing permission check
*   **Affected Plugin:** Google Cloud Backup Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 0.6 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The Google Cloud Backup Plugin's HTTP endpoint does not enforce permission checks, allowing unauthorized users to request a manual backup. Additionally, the endpoint does not require POST requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   Missing permission check: The plugin fails to verify if the user has the necessary permissions to request a backup.
    *   CSRF vulnerability: The lack of POST request enforcement allows an attacker to forge a request to trigger a backup on behalf of another user.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with Overall/Read permissions can request a manual backup, potentially disrupting services or accessing sensitive data through the backup process.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   A remote attacker could craft a malicious request (due to CSRF) and trigger the backup process.
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read permissions on the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Overall/Read permission in Jenkins
    *   Ability to craft a malicious HTTP request (CSRF)

**Summary:**

The Google Cloud Backup Plugin lacks proper authorization checks on its HTTP endpoint for requesting manual backups. This, combined with the absence of CSRF protection, enables an attacker with Overall/Read permissions to trigger backups without explicit user consent or proper authorization, causing a medium-severity security issue.
