The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `month` parameter of the `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockin` endpoint, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly incorporates the `month` parameter into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which can lead to:
  - Database information disclosure (e.g., database name, table schemas, data).
  - Data manipulation (e.g., modification, deletion).
  - Potential for further system compromise if the database user has sufficient privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request to `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockin` endpoint.
- The malicious input is injected through the `month` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No other specific privileges or positions are mentioned.

**Technical Details**
- Vulnerable file: `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockin`
- Vulnerable parameter: `month`
- Example Payload: `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockin&month=2022-07%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,database(),9,10--+`
- This payload leverages `UNION SELECT` to extract database information.
