- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack overflow due to unbounded string formatting using `sprintf`. The value of `sPort` is used in an `sprintf` format string without proper size checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The `sPort` value, controlled by the attacker, can be excessively long leading to a write beyond buffer boundaries on the stack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution. The stack overflow allows hijacking of PC registers and can lead to a stable root shell.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` with a long string for the `sPort` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. No authentication appears to be required based on the provided PoC.
