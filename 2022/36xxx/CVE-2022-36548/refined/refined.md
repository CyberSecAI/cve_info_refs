Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36548 (based on the filename in the first document)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "name" field within the patient settings page of the edoc-doctor-appointment-system v1.0.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application does not sanitize user-supplied input before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the "name" field. This malicious script is then executed when a user views the account details, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal or modify user authentication information, such as session data.
*   **Data Modification:** The attacker could potentially modify user data and deface the application
*   **Redirection:** Users can be redirected to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web application interface.
*   **Input Field:** Specifically, the "name" input field within the patient account settings page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be logged in as a patient to access the settings page.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Input:** The attacker needs to know where to inject the malicious script.

**Technical Details:**
1.  The attacker logs into the application as a patient.
2.  The attacker navigates to the patient settings page.
3.  The attacker inputs malicious JavaScript code (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) into the "name" field.
4.  The application stores the malicious input in the database without sanitization.
5.  When the user views the account details page the stored script is executed.
