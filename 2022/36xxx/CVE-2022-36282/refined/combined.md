How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Installation

1. Upload `search-exclude` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Go to any post/page edit page and check off the checkbox `Exclude from Search Results` if you don’t want the post/page to be shown in the search results

## FAQ

### Does this plugin affect SEO?

No, it does not affect crawling and indexing by search engines.

The ONLY thing it does is hiding selected post/pages from your site search page. Not altering SEO indexing.

If you want posts/pages to be hidden from search engines you may add the following snippet to your `functions.php`:

```
function add_meta_for_search_excluded()
{
    global $post;
    if (false !== array_search($post->ID, get_option('sep_exclude', array()))) {
        echo '<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />', "\n";
    }
}
add_action('wp_head', 'add_meta_for_search_excluded');

```

Note: already indexed pages will remain indexed for quite a while. In order to remove them from Google index, you may use Google Search Console (or similar tool for other engines).

### Are there any hooks or actions available to customize plugin behaviour?

Yes.

There is an action `searchexclude_hide_from_search`.

You can pass any post/page/custom\_post ids as an array in the first parameter.

The second parameter specifies state of visibility in search. Pass true if you want to hide posts/pages,

or false – if you want show them in the search results.

Example:

Let’s say you want “Exclude from Search Results” checkbox to be checked off by default

for newly created posts, but not pages. In this case you can add following code

to your theme’s function.php:

```
add_filter('default_content', 'exclude_new_post_by_default', 10, 2);
function exclude_new_post_by_default($content, $post)
{
    if ('post' === $post->post_type) {
        do_action('searchexclude_hide_from_search', array($post->ID), true);
    }
}

```

Also there is a filter `searchexclude_filter_search`.

With this filter you can turn on/off search filtering dynamically.

Parameters:

$exclude – current search filtering state (specifies whether to filter search or not)

$query – current WP\_Query object

By returning true or false you can turn search filtering respectively.

Example:

Let’s say you need to disable search filtering if searching by specific post\_type.

In this case you could add following code to you functions.php:

```
add_filter('searchexclude_filter_search', 'filterForProducts', 10, 2);
function filterForProducts($exclude, $query)
{
    return $exclude && 'product' !== $query->get('post_type');
}

```

The plugin works excellent for what I need and I never had a problem so far. Some weeks ago an update came with a bug and thanks to this I lost all my exclude settings. I contacted the customer support and I can only say the best. They reacted quick and we could solve the problem together. I wouldn´t hestitate to contact them again in the future if there is another problem.

An upgrade of this plugin broke my site. Contacting support was easy and relatively fast.
Support was able to log in to my staging site and determine the issue was tied to my theme, so it was a special case. It took them a couple of weeks to put out a fix, but when they did, they contacted me to let me know it was available. The plugin works again as expected.
I appreciate the professionalism and the great plugin.
