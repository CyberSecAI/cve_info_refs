The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/isms/admin/stocks/manage_waste.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `id` parameter of `/isms/admin/stocks/manage_waste.php`.
- The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied `id` parameter before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries.
- The provided example demonstrates how an attacker can determine the length of the database name.
- Other attacks could allow the retrieval of complete tables or even modification of the data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the `/isms/admin/stocks/manage_waste.php` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `id` parameter in the GET request.
- No special privileges or access is mentioned other than the ability to reach the endpoint.
