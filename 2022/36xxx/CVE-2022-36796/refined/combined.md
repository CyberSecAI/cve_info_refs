How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

CallRail is here to bring complete visibility to the marketers who rely on quality inbound leads to measure success. Our customers live in a results-driven world, and giving them a clear view into their digital marketing efforts is a first priority for CallRail. We see the opportunities in surfacing and connecting data from calls, forms, chat and beyond — helping our customers get to better outcomes.

Our WordPress plugin allows you to learn detailed information about the source and web session of every caller from your website using a process called [Dynamic Number Insertion](https://www.callrail.com/leads/dynamic-number-insertion-2/). It also powers our form tracking tool, which gives you the power to attribute form submissions back to their source and learn about what the user did on your site before submitting the form.

* Learn more about [CallRail](https://www.callrail.com/).
* Check out our WP plugin [support documentation.](https://support.callrail.com/hc/en-us/articles/201011537)

## Installation

1. Sign in to your CallRail account and click the **Settings tab**.
2. Select the company you want from the dropdown menu.

### [Bad Performance](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/bad-performance-22/)

This plugin works, but months later, we looked at our server logs, and this URL below took so long to process that it took all our sites down for a couple of minutes. And it runs often.
/index.php?rest\_route=/Calltrk/v1/store
I would use the javascript route for adding call rail, not this plugin.

### [Callrail = Callfail](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/callrail-callfail/)

[Discount Web Designer](https://profiles.wordpress.org/discountwebdesigner/ "Posts by Discount Web Designer")
September 26, 2019

Constant integration issues with Adwords make our conversion data mostly useless. In Adwords this is a huge problem.
They recently lost 2/3 of our all time call recordings!!!!! This data was priceless and is unrecoverable.
Callrail’s support is some of the worst I have encountered and even during emergency situations they are not in a hurry to help. Calls to support go unanswered and if we get a callback it is often the next day by someone who has little knowledge.
We are finding a new company to work with and I would suggest others to do the same.
I will update this post with a full breakdown of all our callrail issues once we have migrated to a new provider. Too many to list at the current moment 🙁
