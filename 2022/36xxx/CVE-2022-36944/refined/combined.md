| files need formatting, and there's a `ReflectUtil` thing that needs addressing. otherwise, this is copied directly from 2.13. there's not a lot more I can do from a browser. hopefully it's not too much work for someone to address that one thing and run scalafmt (and probably squash the commits) |

# Install

## Install Scala with cs setup (recommended)

To install Scala, it is recommended to use `cs setup`,
the Scala installer powered by Coursier. It installs everything necessary to use the latest Scala release from a
command line:

* macOS
* Linux
* Windows
* Other

Run the following command in your terminal, following the on-screen instructions:

```
brew install coursier/formulas/coursier && cs setup
```

Alternatively for Apple Silicon, or if you don't use Homebrew:

On the Apple Silicon (M1, M2, â¦) architecture:

```
curl -fL https://github.com/VirtusLab/coursier-m1/releases/latest/download/cs-aarch64-apple-darwin.gz | gzip -d > cs && chmod +x cs && (xattr -d com.apple.quarantine cs || true) && ./cs setup
```

Otherwise, on the x86-64 architecture:

```
curl -fL https://github.com/coursier/coursier/releases/latest/download/cs-x86_64-apple-darwin.gz | gzip -d > cs && chmod +x cs && (xattr -d com.apple.quarantine cs || true) && ./cs setup
```

Run the following command in your terminal, following the on-screen instructions.

On the x86-64 architecture:

```
curl -fL https://github.com/coursier/coursier/releases/latest/download/cs-x86_64-pc-linux.gz | gzip -d > cs && chmod +x cs && ./cs setup
```

Otherwise, on the ARM64 architecture:

```
curl -fL https://github.com/VirtusLab/coursier-m1/releases/latest/download/cs-aarch64-pc-linux.gz | gzip -d > cs && chmod +x cs && ./cs setup
```

Download and execute [the Scala
installer for Windows](https://github.com/coursier/coursier/releases/latest/download/cs-x86_64-pc-win32.zip) based on Coursier, and follow the on-screen instructions.

JavaScript is disabled, click the tab relevant for your OS.

Follow the documentation from Coursier on [how to install and run `cs setup`](https://get-coursier.io/docs/cli-installation).

Testing your setup

Check your setup with the command `scala -version`, which should output:

```
$ scala -version
Scala code runner version 3.3.4 -- Copyright 2002-2022, LAMP/EPFL
```

If that does not work, close and reopen your terminal; otherwise, you may need to log out and log back in (or reboot) in order for the changes to take
effect.

If you are just beginning your journey with Scala,
we recommend that you read our getting started guide, which expands upon these details, teaching you how to build
your first Scala project:

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-8qv5-68g4-248j)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-8qv5-68g4-248j/dependabot)

## Package

maven

org.scala-lang:scala-library
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 2.13.0, < 2.13.9

## Patched versions

2.13.9

## Description

Scala 2.13.x before 2.13.9 has a Java deserialization chain in its JAR file. On its own, it cannot be exploited. There is only a risk in conjunction with LazyList object deserialization within an application. In such situations, it allows attackers to erase contents of arbitrary files, make network connections, or possibly run arbitrary code (specifically, Function0 functions) via a gadget chain.

### @lrytz **[lrytz](/lrytz)** commented [Aug 23, 2022](#issue-1347503059) • edited Loading

This PR ensures that LazyList deserialization will not execute an arbitrary `Function0` when being passed a forged serialization stream.

### Overview

The most important take-away is: **Deserializing untrusted data in a Scala (or Java) application is always a security risk.** This recommendation does **not** change after this PR is merged.

A forged serialization stream can be used to execute unrelated code, which can be exploited. The next section explains the case that is being addressed in this PR in detail. However, any class on an application's classpath with similar code can be exploited. Therefore, untrusted data should never be deserialized.

A presentation about the topic: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfE2OgUlKc>

### Technical details

The following details play together:

* `LazyList` has a `var lazyState: () => LazyList.State[A]` field, which is of type `Function0` in bytecode
* Serialization uses a "proxy" object with custom serialization / deserialization methods:
  + Evaluated elements of the lazy list are serialized first
  + Then the unevaluated tail of the lazy list is serialized using standard Java object serialization
* The deserialization method invokes `tail.prependedAll(init)` to reconstruct the lazy list (`init` are the evaluated elements)
* The `prependedAll` may invoke the `lazyState()` function of the `tail` object; this does not happen under normal circumstances, but a forged serialization stream can force the control flow into this situation
* The `lazyState` object is created when deserializing the `tail` object
  + On a typical application classpath, there are a lot of `Function0` subclasses; for example, every argument to a by-name parameter is encoded into a `Function0`
  + A forged serialization stream can contain any `Function0` instance for the `lazyState` field, for example one that interacts with the file system or the network

In this scenario, the invocation of the `lazyState` function happens before the deserialized `LazyList` is actually used (for example assigned to a local variable). So even if the `LazyList` object would lead to a `ClassCastException` later on, the custom `lazyState` function is already executed. In other words, a serialization stream containing a forged `LazyList` would lead to executing the `Function0` at any deserialization of the application, no matter what object type the application expects to read.

### Change in this PR

In this PR, we change the `LazyList` deserialization method to ensure that this process cannot evaluate the `state` of the lazy `tail`.

The forged `Function0` can still be executed later when evaluating the tail of the lazy list. However, this is only possible if the application actually expects a serialized `LazyList` and evaluates its tail. This makes an exploit much less likely.

why don't we use a `Builder[LazyList]` for `init` instead of an `ArrayBuffer`, and just call `lazyAppendedAll` on the result?

in fact, because `tail` is also a `LazyList`, I believe we can use `LazyBuilder` and just call `addAll` with `tail` as an argument, and we don't even rebuild the `LazyList` ever (not that I think it has a huge performance impact)

side note: there was a discussion at some point somewhere suggesting that no `Builder`s should be lazy (don't remember where), and that `LazyList.newBuilder` should return an eager `Builder` (probably for `List`) that calls `mapResult` to create a `LazyList`. On the off-chance that ever happens, we should explicitly create a `new LazyBuilder` rather than calling `LazyList.newBuilder` if we go with the change I suggested

to put it differently: evaluating `tail` there does not represent a fundamental flaw, shortcoming or gap in the design of `LazyList`, it represents a careless programming error likely due to copy-pasting

Looking at `LazyBuilder`, I actually think we'd run into the same issue. If we change the code to

```
      val tail = in.readObject().asInstanceOf[LazyList[A]]
      coll = lazyBuilder.addAll(tail).result()

```

we have

```
    override def addAll(xs: IterableOnce[A]): this.type = {
      if (xs.knownSize != 0) {
        ...

  override def knownSize: Int = if (knownIsEmpty) 0 else -1
...
  private[this] def knownIsEmpty: Boolean = stateEvaluated && isEmpty
...
  override def isEmpty: Boolean = state eq State.Empty

```

So calling `addAll` could evaluate the `state` lazy val, which calls the `lazyState` function.

Yeah, a forged serialization stream can have that field set to `true`

[@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz) I whipped up my own fix that uses `stateFromIteratorConcatSuffix`. I was going to push an alternate PR to consider, but I haven't figured out how to actually test that the fix works. Been having issues deserializing the lambda.

If you'd like to use my code, the only changes are to the `SerializationProxy` (below)

```
  final class SerializationProxy[A](@transient protected var coll: LazyList[A]) extends Serializable {

    private[this] def writeObject(out: ObjectOutputStream): Unit = {
      out.defaultWriteObject()
      var these = coll
      while(these.knownNonEmpty) {
        out.writeObject(these.head)
        these = these.tail
      }
      out.writeObject(SerializeEnd)
      out.writeObject(these)
    }

    private[this] def readObject(in: ObjectInputStream): Unit = {
      in.defaultReadObject()
      val init = new ListBuffer[A]
      var initRead = false
      while (!initRead) in.readObject match {
        case SerializeEnd => initRead = true
        case a => init += a.asInstanceOf[A]
      }
      val tail = in.readObject().asInstanceOf[LazyList[A]]
      coll = newLL(stateFromIteratorConcatSuffix(init.toList.iterator)(tail.state))
    }

    private[this] def readResolve(): Any = coll
  }
```

and to import `ListBuffer` instead of `ArrayBuffer`.

Edit: I think the only change is to `readObject`?

it feels weird to me to add a new method used just for this when we already have lazy methods. I think the main issue was using an `ArrayBuffer` (which is on me)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2129809#c0)  Avinash Hanwate    2022-09-26 10:23:36 UTC  ``` Scala 2.13.x before 2.13.9 has a Java deserialization chain in its JAR file. On its own, it cannot be exploited. There is only a risk in conjunction with LazyList object deserialization within an application. In such situations, it allows attackers to erase contents of arbitrary files, make network connections, or possibly run arbitrary code (specifically, Function0 functions) via a gadget chain.  <https://www.scala-lang.org/download/> <https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10118>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2129809#c1)  Avinash Hanwate    2022-09-26 10:23:55 UTC  ``` Created scala tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2129810](show_bug.cgi?id=2129810 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-36944 scala: deserialization gadget chain [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2129809#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2022-11-28 03:25:20 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

The following changes are highlights of this release:

### Regression

Library maintainers should avoid publishing libraries using Scala 2.13.9. Please use [2.13.10](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/v2.13.10) instead. 2.13.9 has a [regression](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues/12650) where binary-incompatible bytecode is emitted for case classes which are also value classes (`case class ... extends AnyVal`).

### Compatibility with Scala 3

* Tasty Reader: Add support for Scala 3.2 ([#10068](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10068))
* Tasty Reader: Restrict access to experimental definitions ([#10020](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10020))
* To aid cross-building, accept and ignore `using` in method calls ([#10064](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10064) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* To aid cross-building, allow `?` as a wildcard even without `-Xsource:3` ([#9990](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9990))
* Make Scala-3-style implicit resolution explicitly opt-in rather than bundled in `-Xsource:3` ([#10012](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10012) by [@povder](https://github.com/povder))
* Prefer type of overridden member when inferring (under `-Xsource:3`) ([#9891](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9891) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### JDK version support

* Make `-release` more useful, deprecate `-target`, align with Scala 3 ([#9982](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9982) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Support JDK 19 ([#10001](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10001) by [@Philippus](https://github.com/Philippus))

### Warnings and lints

* Add `-Wnonunit-statement` to warn about discarded values in statement position ([#9893](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9893) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Make unused-import warnings easier to silence (support filtering by `origin=`) ([#9939](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9939) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* Add `-Wperformance` lints for `*Ref` boxing and nonlocal `return` ([#9889](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9889) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Language improvements

* Improve support for Unicode supplementary characters in identifiers and string interpolation ([#9805](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9805) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

### Compiler options

* Use subcolon args to simplify optimizer options ([#9810](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9810) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))
* For troubleshooting compiler, add `-Vdebug-type-error` (and remove `-Yissue-debug`) ([#9824](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9824) by [@tribbloid](https://github.com/tribbloid))

### Security

* Error on source files with Unicode directional formatting characters ([#10017](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10017))
* Prevent `Function0` execution during `LazyList` deserialization ([#10118](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10118))

### Bugfixes

* Emit all bridge methods non-final (perhaps affecting serialization compat) ([#9976](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9976))
* Fix null-pointer regression in `Vector#prependedAll` and `Vector#appendedAll` ([#9983](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/9983))
* Improve concurrent behavior of Java `ConcurrentMap` wrapper

  ([#10027](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10027) by [@igabaydulin](https://github.com/igabaydulin))
* Preserve null policy in wrapped Java `Map`s ([#10129](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/10129) by [@som-snytt](https://github.com/som-snytt))

Changes that shipped in Scala 2.12.16 and 2.12.17 are also included in this release.

For the complete 2.13.9 change lists, see [all merged PRs](https://github.com/scala/scala/pulls?q=is%3Amerged%20milestone%3A2.13.9) and [all closed bugs](https://github.com/scala/bug/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2.13.9).

## Compatibility

As usual for our minor releases, Scala 2.13.9 is [binary-compatible](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/binary-compatibility-of-scala-releases.html) with the whole Scala 2.13 series.

Upgrading from 2.12? Enable `-Xmigration` while upgrading to request migration advice from the compiler.

## Contributors

A big thank you to everyone who's helped improve Scala by reporting bugs, improving our documentation, spreading kindness in discussions around Scala, and submitting and reviewing pull requests! You are all magnificent.

We especially acknowledge and thank A. P. Marki, also known as Som Snytt, who is responsible for an especially large share of the improvements in this release.

This release was brought to you by 27 contributors, according to `git shortlog -sn --no-merges @ ^v2.13.8 ^2.12.x`. Thank you A. P. Marki, Lukas Rytz, Seth Tisue, Jamie Thompson, Sébastien Doeraene, Scala Steward, Georgi Krastev, Jason Zaugg, Philippus, Balys Anikevicius, Gilad Hoch, NthPortal, Zhang Zhipeng, Arman Bilge, Dale Wijnand, Dominik Helm, Eric Huang, Guillaume Martres, Harrison Houghton, Krzysztof Pado, Michał Pałka, Zeeshan Arif, counter2015, jxnu-liguobin, mcallisto, naveen, philwalk.

Thanks to [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/scala) for their continued sponsorship of the Scala core team’s efforts. Lightbend offers [commercial support](https://www.lightbend.com/lightbend-platform-subscription) for Scala.

## Scala 2.13 notes

The [release notes for Scala 2.13.0](https://github.com/scala/scala/releases/v2.13.0) have important information applicable to the whole 2.13 series.

# This is Scala 2! Welcome!

This is the home of the [Scala 2](https://www.scala-lang.org)
standard library, compiler, and language spec.

For Scala 3, visit [scala/scala3](https://github.com/scala/scala3).

# How to contribute

Issues and bug reports for Scala 2 are located in [scala/bug](https://github.com/scala/bug). That tracker is also where new contributors may find issues to work on: [good first issues](https://github.com/scala/bug/labels/good%20first%20issue), [help wanted](https://github.com/scala/bug/labels/help%20wanted).

For coordinating broader efforts, we also use the [scala/scala-dev tracker](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues).

To contribute here, please open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#fork--pull) from your fork of this repository.

Be aware that we can't accept additions to the standard library, only modifications to existing code. Binary compatibility forbids adding new public classes or public methods. Additions are made to [scala-library-next](https://github.com/scala/scala-library-next) instead.

We require that you sign the [Scala CLA](https://contribute.akka.io/contribute/cla/scala) before we can merge any of your work, to protect Scala's future as open source software.

The general workflow is as follows.

1. Find/file an issue in scala/bug (or submit a well-documented PR right away!).
2. Fork the scala/scala repo.
3. Push your changes to a branch in your forked repo. For coding guidelines, go [here](https://github.com/scala/scala#coding-guidelines).
4. Submit a pull request to scala/scala from your forked repo.

For more information on building and developing the core of Scala, read the rest of this README, especially for [setting up your machine](https://github.com/scala/scala#get-ready-to-contribute)!

# Get in touch!

In order to get in touch with other Scala contributors, join the
#scala-contributors channel on the [Scala Discord](https://discord.com/invite/scala) chat, or post on
[contributors.scala-lang.org](https://contributors.scala-lang.org) (Discourse).

If you need some help with your PR at any time, please feel free to @-mention anyone from the list below, and we will do our best to help you out:

# Branches

Target the oldest branch you would like your changes to end up in. We periodically merge forward from older release branches (e.g., 2.12.x) to new ones (e.g. 2.13.x).

If your change is difficult to merge forward, you may be asked to also submit a separate PR targeting the newer branch.

If your change is version-specific and shouldn't be merged forward, put `[nomerge]` in the PR name.

If your change is a backport from a newer branch and thus doesn't need to be merged forward, put `[backport]` in the PR name.

## Choosing a branch

Most changes should target 2.13.x. We are increasingly reluctant to target 2.12.x unless there is a special reason (e.g. if an especially bad bug is found, or if there is commercial sponsorship).

The 2.11.x branch is now [inactive](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/451) and no further 2.11.x releases are planned (unless unusual, unforeseeable circumstances arise). You should not target 2.11.x without asking maintainers first.

# Get ready to contribute

## Requirements

You need the following tools:

* Java SDK. The baseline version is 8 for both 2.12.x and 2.13.x. It is almost always fine
  to use a later SDK such as 11 or 15 for local development. CI will verify against the
  baseline version.
* sbt

MacOS and Linux work. Windows may work if you use Cygwin. Community help with keeping
the build working on Windows and documenting any needed setup is appreciated.

## Tools we use

We are grateful for the following OSS licenses:

* [JProfiler Java profiler](https://www.ej-technologies.com/products/jprofiler/overview.html)
* [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/)
* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* [![Revved up by Develocity](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/966556624b480f57f0a5fe332b1d0089a2abe01d42af03c46af08f73f9244801/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f526576766564253230757025323062792d446576656c6f636974792d3036413043453f6c6f676f3d477261646c65266c6162656c436f6c6f723d303233303341)](https://develocity.scala-lang.org)

## Build setup

### Basics

During ordinary development, a new Scala build is built by the
previously released version, known as the "reference compiler" or,
slangily, as "STARR" (stable reference release). Building with STARR
is sufficient for most kinds of changes.

However, a full build of Scala is *bootstrapped*. Bootstrapping has
two steps: first, build with STARR; then, build again using the
freshly built compiler, leaving STARR behind. This guarantees that
every Scala version can build itself.

If you change the code generation part of the Scala compiler, your
changes will only show up in the bytecode of the library and compiler
after a bootstrap. Our CI does a bootstrapped build.

**Bootstrapping locally**: To perform a bootstrap, run `restarrFull`
within an sbt session. This will build and publish the Scala
distribution to your local artifact repository and then switch sbt to
use that version as its new `scalaVersion`. You may then revert back
with `reload`. Note `restarrFull` will also write the STARR version
to `buildcharacter.properties` so you can switch back to it with
`restarr` without republishing. This will switch the sbt session to
use the `build-restarr` and `target-restarr` directories instead of
`build` and `target`, which avoids wiping out classfiles and
incremental metadata. IntelliJ will continue to be configured to
compile and run tests using the starr version in
`versions.properties`.

For history on how the current scheme was arrived at, see
<https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/gp5JsM1E0Fo/discussion>.

**Building with fatal warnings**: To make warnings in the project fatal (i.e. turn them into errors), run `set Global / fatalWarnings := true` in sbt (replace `Global` with the name of a module—such as `reflect`—to only make warnings fatal for that module). To disable fatal warnings again, either `reload` sbt, or run `set Global / fatalWarnings := false` (again, replace `Global` with the name of a module if you only enabled fatal warnings for that module). CI always has fatal warnings enabled.

### Using the sbt build

Once you've started an `sbt` session you can run one of the core commands:

* `compile` compiles all sub-projects (library, reflect, compiler, scaladoc, etc)
* `scala` / `scalac` run the REPL / compiler directly from sbt (accept options /
  arguments)
* `enableOptimizer` reloads the build with the Scala optimizer enabled. Our releases are built this way. Enable this when working on compiler performance improvements. When the optimizer is enabled the build will be slower and incremental builds can be incorrect.
* `setupPublishCore` runs `enableOptimizer` and configures a version number based on the current Git SHA. Often used as part of bootstrapping: `sbt setupPublishCore publishLocal && sbt -Dstarr.version=<VERSION> testAll`
* `dist/mkBin` generates runner scripts (`scala`, `scalac`, etc) in `build/quick/bin`
* `dist/mkPack` creates a build in the Scala distribution format in `build/pack`
* `junit/test` runs the JUnit tests; `junit/testOnly *Foo` runs a subset
* `scalacheck/test` runs scalacheck tests, use `testOnly` to run a subset
* `partest` runs partest tests (accepts options, try `partest --help`)
* `publishLocal` publishes a distribution locally (can be used as `scalaVersion` in
  other sbt projects)
  + Optionally `set baseVersionSuffix := "bin-abcd123-SNAPSHOT"`
    where `abcd123` is the git hash of the revision being published. You can also
    use something custom like `"bin-mypatch"`. This changes the version number from
    `2.13.2-SNAPSHOT` to something more stable (`2.13.2-bin-abcd123-SNAPSHOT`).
  + Note that the `-bin` string marks the version binary compatible. Using it in
    sbt will cause the `scalaBinaryVersion` to be `2.13`. If the version is not
    binary compatible, we recommend using `-pre`, e.g., `2.14.0-pre-abcd123-SNAPSHOT`.
  + Optionally `set ThisBuild / Compile / packageDoc / publishArtifact := false`
    to skip generating / publishing API docs (speeds up the process).

If a command results in an error message like `a module is not authorized to depend on itself`, it may be that a global sbt plugin is causing
a cyclical dependency. Try disabling global sbt plugins (perhaps by
temporarily commenting them out in `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/plugins.sbt`).

#### Sandbox

We recommend keeping local test files in the `sandbox` directory which is listed in
the `.gitignore` of the Scala repo.

#### Incremental compilation

Note that sbt's incremental compilation is often too coarse for the Scala compiler
codebase and re-compiles too many files, resulting in long build times (check
[sbt#1104](https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/1104) for progress on that front). In the
meantime you can:

* Use IntelliJ IDEA for incremental compiles (see [IDE Setup](#ide-setup) below) - its
  incremental compiler is a bit less conservative, but usually correct.

### IDE setup

We suggest using IntelliJ IDEA (see
[src/intellij/README.md](/scala/scala/blob/2.13.x/src/intellij/README.md)).

[Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/) may also work, but we don't
yet have instructions or sample configuration for that. A pull request
in this area would be exceedingly welcome. In the meantime, we are
collecting guidance at
[scala/scala-dev#668](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/668).

In order to use IntelliJ's incremental compiler:

* run `dist/mkBin` in sbt to get a build and the runner scripts in `build/quick/bin`
* run "Build" - "Make Project" in IntelliJ

Now you can edit and build in IntelliJ and use the scripts (compiler, REPL) to
directly test your changes. You can also run the `scala`, `scalac` and `partest`
commands in sbt. Enable "Ant mode" (explained above) to prevent sbt's incremental
compiler from re-compiling (too many) files before each `partest` invocation.

# Coding guidelines

Our guidelines for contributing are explained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](/scala/scala/blob/2.13.x/CONTRIBUTING.md).
It contains useful information on our coding standards, testing, documentation, how
we use git and GitHub and how to get your code reviewed.

You may also want to check out the following resources:

* The ["Scala Hacker Guide"](https://scala-lang.org/contribute/hacker-guide.html)
  covers some of the same ground as this README, but in greater detail and in a more
  tutorial style, using a running example.

# Scala CI

[![Build Status](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ae26e1f60753a5a0d7f54c65203ca8c3937722aa4679de2b08aebc31cbd5b77d/68747470733a2f2f7472617669732d63692e636f6d2f7363616c612f7363616c612e7376673f6272616e63683d322e31332e78)](https://travis-ci.com/scala/scala)

Once you submit a PR your commits will be automatically tested by the Scala CI.

Our CI setup is always evolving. See
[scala/scala-dev#751](https://github.com/scala/scala-dev/issues/751)
for more details on how things currently work and how we expect they
might change.

If you see a spurious failure on Jenkins, you can post `/rebuild` as a PR comment.
The [scabot README](https://github.com/scala/scabot) lists all available commands.

If you'd like to test your patch before having everything polished for review,
you can have Travis CI build your branch (make sure you have a fork and have Travis CI
enabled for branch builds on it first, and then push your branch). Also
feel free to submit a draft PR. In case your draft branch contains
a large number of commits (that you didn't clean up / squash yet for review),
consider adding `[ci: last-only]` to the PR title. That way only the last commit
will be tested, saving some energy and CI-resources. Note that inactive draft PRs
will be closed eventually, which does not mean the change is being rejected.

CI performs a compiler bootstrap. The first task, `validatePublishCore`, publishes
a build of your commit to the temporary repository
<https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/artifactory/scala-pr-validation-snapshots>.
Note that this build is not yet bootstrapped, its bytecode is built using the
current STARR. The version number is `2.13.2-bin-abcd123-SNAPSHOT` where `abcd123`
is the commit hash. For binary incompatible builds, the version number is
`2.14.0-pre-abcd123-SNAPSHOT`.

You can use Scala builds in the validation repository locally by adding a resolver
and specifying the corresponding `scalaVersion`:

```
$ sbt
> set resolvers += "pr" at "https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/artifactory/scala-pr-validation-snapshots/"
> set scalaVersion := "2.12.2-bin-abcd123-SNAPSHOT"
> console

```

## "Nightly" builds

The Scala CI publishes these to
<https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/artifactory/scala-integration/> .

Using a nightly build in sbt and other tools is explained on this
[doc page](https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/nightlies.html).

Although we casually refer to these as "nightly" builds, they aren't
actually built nightly, but "mergely". That is to say, a build is
published for every merged PR.

## Scala CI internals

The Scala CI runs as a Jenkins instance on [scala-ci.typesafe.com](https://scala-ci.typesafe.com/),
configured by a chef cookbook at [scala/scala-jenkins-infra](https://github.com/scala/scala-jenkins-infra).

The build bot that watches PRs, triggers testing builds and applies the "reviewed" label
after an LGTM comment is in the [scala/scabot](https://github.com/scala/scabot) repo.

## Community build

The Scala community build is an important method for testing Scala
releases. A community build can be launched for any Scala commit, even
before the commit's PR has been merged. That commit is then used to
build a large number of open-source projects from source and run their
test suites.

To request a community build run on your PR, just ask in a comment on
the PR and a Scala team member (probably @SethTisue) will take care of
it. ([details](https://github.com/scala/community-builds/wiki#can-i-run-it-against-a-pull-request-in-scalascala))

Community builds run on the Scala Jenkins instance. The jobs are
named `..-integrate-community-build`. See the
[scala/community-builds](https://github.com/scala/community-builds)
repo.

| looked at this with Raphael just now and some work items remain:   * move the code to the `scala_2.11_2.12` folder (hopefully a separate 2.11 version won't be needed) * refactor to remove the duplication of `assertThrow*` |

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 36 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GNUToolchainF36](/wiki/Changes/GNUToolchainF36 "Changes/GNUToolchainF36")
* [FsVerityRPM](/wiki/Changes/FsVerityRPM "Changes/FsVerityRPM")
* [LIBFFI34](/wiki/Changes/LIBFFI34 "Changes/LIBFFI34")
* [Java17](/wiki/Changes/Java17 "Changes/Java17")

## Before the rebuild

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, January 19th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f36
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to the next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to the next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However, maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f36. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f36 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f36
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages are currently built from the source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-01-19 15:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

LazyList is not used in any of the Akka modules as a message, but if:

* Your application uses Java serialization for your messages (disabled by default since Akka 2.6.0 and not recommended)
* *and* you use LazyList as a message itself or a field in your messages sent between nodes and configured to allow deserializing with Java serialization (a relatively strange/unlikely type to use as messages)
* *and* have a cluster where an untrusted part would be allowed to connect to the cluster/Akka Remoting ports (also not recommended)

you could be at risk.

Making sure to update to Scala 2.13.9 seems like a good idea regardless.

### @lrytz **[lrytz](/lrytz)** commented [Aug 23, 2022](#issue-1347503059) • edited Loading

This PR ensures that LazyList deserialization will not execute an arbitrary `Function0` when being passed a forged serialization stream.

### Overview

The most important take-away is: **Deserializing untrusted data in a Scala (or Java) application is always a security risk.** This recommendation does **not** change after this PR is merged.

A forged serialization stream can be used to execute unrelated code, which can be exploited. The next section explains the case that is being addressed in this PR in detail. However, any class on an application's classpath with similar code can be exploited. Therefore, untrusted data should never be deserialized.

A presentation about the topic: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTfE2OgUlKc>

### Technical details

The following details play together:

* `LazyList` has a `var lazyState: () => LazyList.State[A]` field, which is of type `Function0` in bytecode
* Serialization uses a "proxy" object with custom serialization / deserialization methods:
  + Evaluated elements of the lazy list are serialized first
  + Then the unevaluated tail of the lazy list is serialized using standard Java object serialization
* The deserialization method invokes `tail.prependedAll(init)` to reconstruct the lazy list (`init` are the evaluated elements)
* The `prependedAll` may invoke the `lazyState()` function of the `tail` object; this does not happen under normal circumstances, but a forged serialization stream can force the control flow into this situation
* The `lazyState` object is created when deserializing the `tail` object
  + On a typical application classpath, there are a lot of `Function0` subclasses; for example, every argument to a by-name parameter is encoded into a `Function0`
  + A forged serialization stream can contain any `Function0` instance for the `lazyState` field, for example one that interacts with the file system or the network

In this scenario, the invocation of the `lazyState` function happens before the deserialized `LazyList` is actually used (for example assigned to a local variable). So even if the `LazyList` object would lead to a `ClassCastException` later on, the custom `lazyState` function is already executed. In other words, a serialization stream containing a forged `LazyList` would lead to executing the `Function0` at any deserialization of the application, no matter what object type the application expects to read.

In this PR, we change the `LazyList` deserialization method to ensure that this process cannot evaluate the `state` of the lazy `tail`.

The forged `Function0` can still be executed later when evaluating the tail of the lazy list. However, this is only possible if the application actually expects a serialized `LazyList` and evaluates its tail. This makes an exploit much less likely.

why don't we use a `Builder[LazyList]` for `init` instead of an `ArrayBuffer`, and just call `lazyAppendedAll` on the result?

in fact, because `tail` is also a `LazyList`, I believe we can use `LazyBuilder` and just call `addAll` with `tail` as an argument, and we don't even rebuild the `LazyList` ever (not that I think it has a huge performance impact)

side note: there was a discussion at some point somewhere suggesting that no `Builder`s should be lazy (don't remember where), and that `LazyList.newBuilder` should return an eager `Builder` (probably for `List`) that calls `mapResult` to create a `LazyList`. On the off-chance that ever happens, we should explicitly create a `new LazyBuilder` rather than calling `LazyList.newBuilder` if we go with the change I suggested

to put it differently: evaluating `tail` there does not represent a fundamental flaw, shortcoming or gap in the design of `LazyList`, it represents a careless programming error likely due to copy-pasting

Looking at `LazyBuilder`, I actually think we'd run into the same issue. If we change the code to

```
      val tail = in.readObject().asInstanceOf[LazyList[A]]
      coll = lazyBuilder.addAll(tail).result()

```

we have

```
    override def addAll(xs: IterableOnce[A]): this.type = {
      if (xs.knownSize != 0) {
        ...

  override def knownSize: Int = if (knownIsEmpty) 0 else -1
...
  private[this] def knownIsEmpty: Boolean = stateEvaluated && isEmpty
...
  override def isEmpty: Boolean = state eq State.Empty

```

So calling `addAll` could evaluate the `state` lazy val, which calls the `lazyState` function.

[@lrytz](https://github.com/lrytz) I whipped up my own fix that uses `stateFromIteratorConcatSuffix`. I was going to push an alternate PR to consider, but I haven't figured out how to actually test that the fix works. Been having issues deserializing the lambda.

If you'd like to use my code, the only changes are to the `SerializationProxy` (below)

```
  final class SerializationProxy[A](@transient protected var coll: LazyList[A]) extends Serializable {

    private[this] def writeObject(out: ObjectOutputStream): Unit = {
      out.defaultWriteObject()
      var these = coll
      while(these.knownNonEmpty) {
        out.writeObject(these.head)
        these = these.tail
      }
      out.writeObject(SerializeEnd)
      out.writeObject(these)
    }

    private[this] def readObject(in: ObjectInputStream): Unit = {
      in.defaultReadObject()
      val init = new ListBuffer[A]
      var initRead = false
      while (!initRead) in.readObject match {
        case SerializeEnd => initRead = true
        case a => init += a.asInstanceOf[A]
      }
      val tail = in.readObject().asInstanceOf[LazyList[A]]
      coll = newLL(stateFromIteratorConcatSuffix(init.toList.iterator)(tail.state))
    }

    private[this] def readResolve(): Any = coll
  }
```

and to import `ListBuffer` instead of `ArrayBuffer`.

Edit: I think the only change is to `readObject`?

it feels weird to me to add a new method used just for this when we already have lazy methods. I think the main issue was using an `ArrayBuffer` (which is on me)

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.
