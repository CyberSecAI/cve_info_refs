    "source": "github.com_66ef54bd_20250115_180736.html",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a Java deserialization issue in Scala's LazyList. By crafting a malicious serialization stream, an attacker can force the execution of arbitrary `Function0` during deserialization. This can lead to file deletion, network connections, or arbitrary code execution.",
    "affected_component": "LazyList",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the way `LazyList` is deserialized, where a forged serialization stream can cause the invocation of a `lazyState` function before the deserialized object is used. The `lazyState` can be set to any `Function0` instance, which an attacker can control.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through a crafted serialized `LazyList` object. An attacker needs to provide a malicious serialization stream during deserialization of a LazyList object.",
    "impact": "The impact of the vulnerability could include arbitrary file system changes, network connections, or potentially arbitrary code execution via a gadget chain. Specifically, the crafted Function0 could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
     "weakness": "CWE-502, Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted serialized LazyList object to the vulnerable system during deserialization. This can be achieved if the application deserializes user-controlled data.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was present because the `prependedAll` method may invoke the `lazyState()` function of the tail object in a way that can be controlled via a forged serialization stream. The fix prevents the evaluation of `state` during deserialization."
