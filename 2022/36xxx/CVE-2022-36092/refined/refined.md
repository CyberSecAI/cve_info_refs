Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-36092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of access rights when using the `login`, `register`, and `skin` actions in XWiki. Specifically, by using the `xpage` parameter in the URL, an attacker could specify a template, which bypasses normal access controls that should prevent users from viewing content they don't have permission to see. Additionally, the code was loading document data into the context even when the user didn't have view permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Bypass of Access Controls:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to bypass access control checks using the `xpage` parameter, which allows specifying a template to render a page. This bypass occurs because the system does not properly verify view rights before loading the document when using these specific actions.
2.  **Insecure Template Handling:** The system was not restricting template overrides for `login`, `register`, and `skin` actions. This allows an attacker to use these actions to render arbitrary pages using templates, including those not meant for public access.
3.  **Information Disclosure:** When a user attempted to access a page they did not have permission to view through these vulnerable actions, the system was still loading the document into the context. This makes the document content, title, and object properties accessible to the attacker, even though the user should be redirected to login.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the title, content, comments, and object properties of any document on a fully private wiki by exploiting this flaw. This is possible even if the user is not logged in and the wiki is configured to prevent unregistered users from viewing pages.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Private wiki data, which was intended to be inaccessible to unauthorized users, becomes available through this vulnerability.
*   **Circumvention of Privacy Settings:** The vulnerability effectively nullifies the privacy settings of the wiki by allowing unauthorized access to all content.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the network by crafting a specific URL using the `xpage` parameter.

For example:
`server>/xwiki/bin/login/Main/?xpage=view`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker does not need any specific user privileges or account access to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires only network access to the affected XWiki instance.

**Additional Notes:**
The vulnerability is fixed by disallowing template override and performing view rights checks before loading documents into the context. The commit logs also show that the `registerinline` template was explicitly allowed for `RegisterAction`.
The vulnerability also impacts the `delete` action which is described in the related issue XWIKI-18602

This vulnerability is classified as High severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
The vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2022-36092, and is tracked by the GitHub advisory GHSA-8h89-34w2-jpfm.
