Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36096:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of attachment filenames when displaying deleted attachments in the XWiki platform. Specifically, the application was not encoding HTML characters in the filename, which allowed the execution of malicious JavaScript embedded within the filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This means malicious JavaScript is stored within the application's data (the attachment filename) and executed when a user views the affected page.
*   **Improper Input Handling:** The system fails to sanitize user-provided input (filename) before displaying it in a web page context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the "Deleted Attachments" list.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can leverage the XSS to perform actions on behalf of the victim user, potentially including privilege escalation if the victim has elevated permissions. This could include modifying content or accessing sensitive information.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive data from the victim's browser.
*   **Account Takeover:** If the attacker is able to obtain session information, they may be able to impersonate the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a file with a malicious filename containing JavaScript.
*  **User Profile Modification**: The attacker needs write access to the user profile in order to upload the malicious attachment.
*   **Deleted Attachments View:** The XSS is triggered when a user visits the "Deleted Attachments" section of the XWiki platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to the user profile in order to upload a file with a malicious filename.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the XWiki instance over the network.
*   **Knowledge of XWiki:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the XWiki platform to know where the "Deleted Attachments" list is and where to upload files with malicious names.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, as another user needs to view the deleted attachments list to trigger the XSS.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability exists in XWiki versions >= 2.2-milestone-1
*   The vulnerability is fixed in XWiki versions 13.10.6 and 14.3
*   The vulnerability is located in the `XWiki.DeletedAttachments` page
*   The fix involves escaping the HTML characters of the attachment filename and document title by using `escapeHTML()` in the javascript code.
*   The CVSS score is 8.9 (High), and the CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:L`.
