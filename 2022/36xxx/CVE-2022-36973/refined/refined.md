Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `ProfileDaoImpl` class of the Ivanti Avalanche EnterpriseServer service.
- It arises from the construction of SQL queries using user-supplied strings without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability where crafted requests can influence the SQL queries executed by the application.
- **Authentication Bypass:** This SQL injection vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism of the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the Ivanti Avalanche system by circumventing the login process.
- **Data Access/Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could potentially allow attackers to access, modify, or delete sensitive data within the system's database, depending on the privileges available to the injected SQL query.
- **Complete compromise:** The information suggests the impact is high, given the potential for full access and control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable through network requests.
- **Crafted requests:** The attack involves sending malicious crafted requests that contain SQL injection payloads to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, no local access is required
- **No prior authentication:** The attacker does not need prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability, as the vulnerability itself allows for authentication bypass.
