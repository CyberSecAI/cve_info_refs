- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PukiWiki application contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts on the web browser of a user who accesses a site using the vulnerable PukiWiki application.
- **Attack vectors**: Network (the attacker can send a crafted request to the web server). The user interaction is required (the victim must visit a crafted page).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to inject malicious content into the PukiWiki application. This could be achieved by having an account and adding a crafted script within their data.
