- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Certain OpsCenter endpoints could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Leakage
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable OpsCenter endpoints on the network. The attacker needs to have low privileges, meaning they must be an authenticated user, but no high level privileges or special user permissions are required.
