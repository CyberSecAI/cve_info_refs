Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36976:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the execution of SQL queries composed from user-supplied strings within the `GroupDaoImpl` class. This means that user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By crafting a malicious request, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism of the Ivanti Avalanche system.
- **Potential Full System Compromise:** The advisory notes that a successful SQL injection can lead to an authentication bypass. Depending on the permissions of the database user, this may allow the attacker to conduct other malicious actions within the database, and therefore potentially achieve full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is network-accessible, meaning a remote attacker can exploit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability, as it is an authentication bypass vulnerability.
