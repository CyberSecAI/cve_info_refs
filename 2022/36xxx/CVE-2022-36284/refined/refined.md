Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**. This means the plugin directly uses user-provided IDs or references to access objects (like database entries or files) without sufficient authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **IDOR**: The plugin does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied IDs or object references.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassing Authorization:** A malicious actor could bypass authorization checks and gain access to resources they should not be able to access.
*  **Access Sensitive Files/Folders:** An attacker might be able to access sensitive files or folders.
*   **Interact with the Database:** An attacker could potentially interact with the database without proper authorization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through manipulation of IDs or object references within the plugin. This could be through direct manipulation of URLs or API requests, or other similar means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to interact with the plugin in a way that allows them to manipulate object references, which usually means they would need to be a logged-in user of the affected WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs some knowledge of the plugin's functionality to identify where and how to exploit the IDOR vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.8.0 of the plugin.
*   Patchstack gives the vulnerability a CVSS score of 6.4 and a low priority, stating that it is unlikely to be exploited.
*   The changelog for version 4.8.0 confirms that the main focus was on making it compatible with WooCommerce 6.6.0 and includes a fix for an issue that "Updating a non-affiliate user from admin resulting in affiliate request declined error on the registration form". This may be related to the IDOR vulnerability as user ID's could be directly accessed for changes.
