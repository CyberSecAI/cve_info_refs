Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the SQL injection vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the `month` parameter of the `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockout` endpoint.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   SQL injection vulnerability in the `month` parameter.

*   **Impact of exploitation**:
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries into the application's database.
    *   This allows the attacker to potentially leak sensitive information, modify data, or gain unauthorized access to the database.
    *   In the provided example, the attacker is able to use the `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the database name by manipulating the `month` parameter.

*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint, specifically by manipulating the `month` parameter.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
    *   No specific authentication seems required to exploit this vulnerability, but it does occur on an admin page, so it is possible that the application requires some level of authentication in order to access the vulnerable functionality.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided payload `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockout&month=2022-07%27%20union%20select%201,2,3,4,5,6,7,database(),9,10--+` demonstrates how to use a `UNION SELECT` statement to extract the database name.
*   The vulnerable software is identified as "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0 by oretnom23".
*   The specific file where the vulnerability is located is: `/isms/admin/?page=reports/stockout&month=`
* The database name is `isms_db`
