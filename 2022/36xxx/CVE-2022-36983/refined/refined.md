**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36983

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication prior to allowing access to the `SetSettings` class functionality within Ivanti Avalanche.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the absence of authentication checks before allowing access to the `SetSettings` class. This means that an attacker can directly access the functionality without providing any credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized System Modification:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to bypass authentication and potentially modify system settings, leading to unauthorized actions on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Based:** The attack is network-based and can be performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs to have network access to the affected Ivanti Avalanche installation.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass authentication checks and access the `SetSettings` class in Ivanti Avalanche, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of the system. The fix for this vulnerability is included in Avalanche version 6.3.4.
