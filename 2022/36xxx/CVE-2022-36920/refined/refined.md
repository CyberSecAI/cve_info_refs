Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36920:

**CVE-2022-36920**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Coverity Plugin (version 1.11.4 and earlier) does not perform a permission check on an HTTP endpoint. Additionally, the endpoint does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Missing permission check:** The plugin does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the affected HTTP endpoint.
    *  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.
    *   This allows the attacker to potentially capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
    *   The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger the vulnerable functionality through a malicious web page or link, without the user's direct interaction (if the user is logged in).

*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Network-based:** The attacker sends malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   **CSRF:** The attacker could trick a user into visiting a malicious page that triggers the request.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to obtain valid credentials IDs, likely through another vulnerability.
    *   For the CSRF attack, the attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into making the request.

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-36920 describes a combination of a missing permission check and a CSRF vulnerability in the Coverity Plugin. An attacker with Overall/Read permission and the knowledge of valid credential IDs can exploit this vulnerability to connect to an arbitrary URL and capture credentials, potentially through a CSRF attack on a logged in user.
