The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the kensite_cms project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the application constructs SQL queries when renaming database tables. Specifically, the `renameTable` function in `DBMapper.xml` uses string concatenation with the table's `name` and `oldName` parameters directly in the SQL query instead of using parameterized queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the `name` and `oldName` parameters, obtained from the `Table` object, are directly concatenated into the `rename ${oldName} to ${name}` SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: By injecting malicious SQL code through the `name` parameter, an attacker can potentially:
    - Access sensitive database information.
    - Modify or delete data.
    - Potentially gain control over the underlying database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/sys/table/update` endpoint.
- Malicious `name` parameter: The attacker crafts a malicious `name` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to access and call the `/sys/table/update` endpoint. This is stated as requiring an "ordinary user" login to the background.
