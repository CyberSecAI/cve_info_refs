Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `view_category.php` file of the "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0" where the `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input (`id` parameter) in a SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* An attacker can manipulate the SQL query to extract sensitive information from the database (as demonstrated in the example by leaking the database name's length).
* Further SQL injection attacks could lead to data modification, deletion, or even complete database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a GET request to the `/isms/admin/categories/view_category.php` endpoint.
* **`id` Parameter:** The `id` parameter in the URL is the injection point for the malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
* **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** An attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests.
* **SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious SQL queries.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerable system is "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0 by oretnom23."
* The specific file vulnerable to SQLi is `/isms/admin/categories/view_category.php`.
* The provided content demonstrates the use of `length(database())` to verify the vulnerability and extract data, showing it is a blind SQL injection.
* The system's database name is confirmed to have a length of 7 characters based on the screenshot provided.
