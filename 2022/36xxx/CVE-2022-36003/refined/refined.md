Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an improper size check in the `RandomPoissonV2` operation within TensorFlow. When provided with large input shapes and rates, the operation fails a `CHECK` that leads to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient input validation:** The `RandomPoissonV2` function doesn't properly validate or handle excessively large input shapes and rates. This can trigger a `CHECK` failure in the C++ backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a denial of service because the program crashes due to a `CHECK` failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing specific, large input shapes and rate tensors as arguments to the `RandomPoissonV2` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input shapes and rates passed to `RandomPoissonV2`.
- This could potentially be achieved by:
    - A malicious user providing crafted inputs to a TensorFlow model.
    - An attacker exploiting a vulnerability in the software which processes user inputs or interacts with Tensorflow.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
- The patch involves replacing `AppendShape` with `AppendShapeWithStatus` in `random_op.cc` and `random_poisson_op.cc` to handle shape overflow. This change is also mentioned in the commit message, "Fix size check for large input shape and rates."
- The commit ([552bfced6ce4809db5f3ca305f60ff80dd40c5a3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/552bfced6ce4809db5f3ca305f60ff80dd40c5a3))  fixes the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 and has been fixed in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by 刘力源 from the Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology.
