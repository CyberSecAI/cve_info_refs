  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data before including it in the HTML response.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the 'Author' field when editing book details, the injected script is then displayed on the edit_book_details.php page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator (or have the ability to edit book details). They also need to be able to craft and submit an HTTP POST request with malicious data."
