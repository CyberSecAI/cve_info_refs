The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the yimiYWOA software, specifically versions less than 6.1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation in the `/oa/setup/checkPool` endpoint, allowing for the injection of SQL queries.
- The application does not properly sanitize the `database` parameter in the request.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability, allowing for arbitrary SQL execution.
- Unauthorized access to the vulnerable endpoint, bypassing authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- In the provided example, the attacker extracts the database user via SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a POST request to the `/oa/setup/checkPool` endpoint with a crafted `database` parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax to craft malicious queries.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in versions less than 6.1 of the software due to a version check logic in `src/main/java/com/cloudweb/oa/controller/ApplicationController.java`.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by modifying the `database` parameter with a SQL injection payload e.g `database=test'and+(extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select+user()),0x7e)))--+`.
- The attacker needs to modify the version in both configuration file and in the database table `oa_sys_ver`.
