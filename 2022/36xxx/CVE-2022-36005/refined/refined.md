Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36005:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_gradient` and `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannelGradientOp` operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, these operations did not validate if the input tensors for `min` and `max` were of the correct rank (scalar for `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsGradientOp` and vector for `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannelGradientOp`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input validation: The code failed to ensure that the `min` and `max` tensors had the expected rank (scalar or vector), leading to a `CHECK` failure if tensors with incorrect shapes were passed.
- `CHECK` failure: When the invalid rank tensors were passed, the code triggered a `CHECK` failure which causes the program to terminate, thus leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By providing input tensors with incorrect ranks for `min` or `max`, an attacker could trigger a `CHECK` failure, leading to a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: An attacker could craft a TensorFlow model that uses `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_gradient` or  `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel_gradient` and pass non-scalar or non-vector tensors to the `min` or `max` arguments respectively.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide inputs to a TensorFlow model: The attacker needs to be able to provide the input tensors to the vulnerable TensorFlow operation. This could be done by creating a malicious model or by having control over the data that is fed into an existing model.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0.
- The fix involves adding rank checks to ensure that `min` and `max` tensors have the correct rank and size, as demonstrated in the provided commit diff.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a "Low" severity rating.
- Patched versions are 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
