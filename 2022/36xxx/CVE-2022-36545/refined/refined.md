The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `edoc-doctor-appointment-system` application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities exist.
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in database queries, making it vulnerable to various SQL injection attacks, including blind SQL injection, error-based SQL injection, time-based blind SQL injection and UNION query injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database, including patient information, doctor details, and appointment schedules.
- An attacker could possibly modify or delete data in the database.
- An attacker could potentially take control of the database server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and the server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are the following:
- `/patient/doctors.php` via the `id` parameter in the URL.
- `/patient/booking.php` via the `id` parameter in the URL.
- `/patient/settings.php` via the `action` and `id` parameters in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to access the web application.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the SQLi vulnerabilities present in /patient/doctors.php, but they will need to be logged in as a patient to exploit the vulnerabilities in the other two files.
