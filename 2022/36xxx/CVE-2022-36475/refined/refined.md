The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C B5 Mini B5MiniV100R005 router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `AddMacList` function uses `sscanf` with a greedy format specifier `%[^;];` to parse user input. This format specifier continues reading until a semicolon is encountered, which allows for a buffer overflow if the input exceeds the size of the destination buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability in the `AddMacList` function.
- Insecure use of `sscanf` with a greedy format specifier without proper bounds checking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to the crash caused by the stack overflow.
- Potential for remote code execution (RCE) by crafting a payload that overwrites the return address on the stack, enabling the attacker to gain a stable root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with the `CMD=AddMacList` parameter.
- The `param` value in the request contains a long string which triggers the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface (i.e., the attacker must have network connectivity to the device).
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability since a root shell can be obtained without authorization.
