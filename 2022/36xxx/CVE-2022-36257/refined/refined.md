The provided content relates to CVE-2022-36257.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input sanitization in the application's database queries. Several parameters in different files are vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application suffers from SQL injection vulnerabilities in the following files:
*   `UserDAO.java`: Parameters such as `user`, and `pass` are vulnerable.
*   `CustomerDAO.java`: Parameters such as `searchTxt` and `customercode` are vulnerable.
*   `Stocks.java`: Parameter `productcode` is vulnerable.
*   `SupplierDAO.java`: Parameter `searchTxt` is vulnerable.
*   `ProductDAO.java`: Parameter `searchTxt` is vulnerable.
*   `ConnectionFactory.java`: Parameters such as `username`, `password`, and `user` are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious SQL queries by manipulating the vulnerable parameters. This could lead to:
*   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
*   Data modification or deletion.
*   Complete compromise of the database.
*   Potential for further attacks on the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of user-supplied input fields that are used to construct SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the vulnerable parameters, either through the application's user interface or by directly manipulating requests sent to the application. This means the attacker would likely need to have network access to the application.
