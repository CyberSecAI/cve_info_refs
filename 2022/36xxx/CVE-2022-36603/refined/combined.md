\n is a newline. \0 is a NUL byte.

Hey Prototyped,

Ahh yes I see some parts where I used this language interchangeably and too loosely. You can actually use the characters interchangeably for some of these attacks (as in you can use either \n or \0 for many of them). Both will work and the shell will treat null characters as command separators on many of these embedded systems / ASICs.

Thatâ€™s not really an excuse for not using the terms appropriately though (only an explanation of what was going on in my head for this to happen, the truth is I had been trying both versions on different ASICs interchangeably and that bled into my writing a bit here). Iâ€™ve gone through and cleaned up / fixed how I was using these terms to clean this up (at least most of them, there were a lot of references so one or two may have slipped through but there were a couple of dozen of them I changed). Thanks for pointing this out!
