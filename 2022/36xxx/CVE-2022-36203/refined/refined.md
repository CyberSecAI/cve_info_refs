Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36203:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The GitHub content directly mentions `CVE-2022-36203` along with the description "A stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was found in Doctor's Appointment System version 1.0". This aligns with the general description of CVE-2022-36203 being a stored XSS vulnerability.

**2. Detailed Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the Doctor's Appointment System version 1.0 before storing and displaying it. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the system.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is stored within the application's database or file system and executed when other users access the affected area.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** If the injected script is designed to steal cookies or other session identifiers, an attacker can hijack a user's session.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** A malicious script could alter data displayed to users, potentially leading to misinformation or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Phishing:** The injected script could redirect users to a malicious phishing page designed to steal their credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** It could also be used to distribute malware to the victim's machine.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  **User Input:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code through user-accessible input fields. This could be any input field, such as a name field, comment, or any area where a user is allowed to enter text or potentially other types of data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user (patient, doctor, or admin) to inject malicious script. The exact position depends on the vulnerable input field available for the specific user role.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided content also includes information about other CVEs (CVE-2022-36201 and CVE-2022-36202), which are not related to CVE-2022-36203.
*   The source code of the application was found on sourcecodester.com and there is a discussion about the booking limit which does not work as intended.
*   The source code for the Doctor's Appointment System is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/HashenUdara/edoc-doctor-appointment-system](https://github.com/HashenUdara/edoc-doctor-appointment-system)
