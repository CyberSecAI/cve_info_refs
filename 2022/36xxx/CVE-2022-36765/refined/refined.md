Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36765:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `CreateHob()` function within the EDK2 firmware. This function attempts to align the requested HOB size to 8 bytes, performing the calculation `HobLength = (UINT16)((HobLength + 0x7) & (~0x7))`.  No checks are in place to prevent an overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: The lack of bounds checking on the `HobLength` calculation can lead to an overflow, resulting in a smaller HOB being created than requested.
- Out-of-bounds (OOB) read/write: Due to the smaller HOB size, subsequent operations might write outside the allocated buffer. This leads to out-of-bounds read or write operations (OOB R/W).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could lead to out-of-bounds read and write operations on the heap.
- This can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability needs to be triggered during the PEI (Pre-EFI Initialization) phase of the UEFI boot process.
- An attacker needs to find a way to manipulate the input to `CreateHob()` to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability in the PEI phase.
- An attacker would need to have the ability to control the parameters supplied to the `CreateHob()` function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in EDK2 versions <= 202311.
- Patches are available via the provided bugzilla link.
- The issue was reported by xVL00PeR.
- The CVSS score is 7.0, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:H. This indicates:
  - Attack Vector: Local (L)
  - Attack Complexity: High (H)
  - Privileges Required: Low (L)
  - User Interaction: None (N)
  - Scope: Changed (C)
  - Confidentiality Impact: Low (L)
  - Integrity Impact: Low (L)
  - Availability Impact: High (H)
