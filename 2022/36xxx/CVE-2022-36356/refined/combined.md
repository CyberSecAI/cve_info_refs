Ideal to convert your museum items to the wordpress database.
This makes is possible to keep te registration of the museum items up to date on a payable solution.
I converted the data to nationaalcarnavalsmuseum.com and created a solution for the volunteers to add/update the database.
Everyone (in the Netherlands) can search in the data now.
Works still perfect with wordpress 6.0.

Takes some getting used to but an excellent engine to show (part) of your Adlib collection on the internet

The plugin looks very nice, but is incompatible with newest WP release.
I beg the author to actualize it.

## Changelog

#### 4.2

Improvement: Updated dependencies, modernised codebase. Now requires WordPress 6.2 and PHP 8.1

Security: HPSpreadsheet to fix a vulnerability

Security: Fixed several escaping security vulnerabilities

Improvement: Implement WordPress coding standards

#### 4.1

Security Fix: some unescaped output to HTML

Improvement: Implement PSR-4 autoloader for classes

#### 4.0

Update: We now require PHP 7.3 and WordPress 5.2+ for the sake of testing ability on supported software.

#### 3.6

New: SWCE Improvements

#### 3.5

New: Code standard changes

New: Improvements to internationalization efforts

New: CSV2 supports a taxonomy field which can contain comma seperated values.

Fix: Fixes a bug with CSV2 which means new objects could be created each import, rather than updating existing ones.

Deprecated: In Version 4.0, we will require at least PHP 7.2, and then track PHP’s supported versions going forward (until security fixes end) as detailed [on php.net](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)

#### 3.3.0

New: Support CLI cron imports to get around fast-cgi timeouts on some budget hosting. run `php wp-content/plugins/<plugin_folder>/cron.php`

New: CSV2/3.0.0 moves more of the logic out of providers and into CultureObject Core, meaning Version 4 can make writing a provider much easier.

Deprecated: PHP < 5.5 support. We require at least PHP 5.5.

Fix: Support WordPress Multisite. If you were using < 3.0.0 on multisite (you probably weren’t, as it didn’t really work!), you will need to reconfigure Culture Object on each site.

#### 2.2.0

Fix: Support WordPress 4.5

Fix: an issue with EMU imports with some JSON files

#### 2.1.3

Revert to old PHP syntax so we work on PHP 5.3 (but please, please upgrade to PHP 5.6 or PHP 7)

Fix: Remove debug-disablement of taxonomy imports for CultureObject.

#### 2.1.1

Fix: A bug with view files trying to load a file that didn’t exist.

#### 2.1.0

Change: Move provider settings into it’s own submenu

New: CSV Provider

#### 2.0.0

Change: Change menu option to a standalone utility menu item, rather than putting it inside the general settings

New: [CollectionSpace](http://www.collectionspace.org) provider

API New: 2 new functions, cos\_get\_field() and cos\_the\_field() provide abstracted access to imported data. This is the recommended way to access Culture Object data from v2.0.0 onwards, as we can provide begin to implement context handlers in future releases, especially as WordPress 4.4 introduces a new taxonomy metadata API, which will remove some of complexities we’re currently having to implement.

API New: Providers can add an execute\_init\_action method which is attached to a WordPress [init action hook](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/init). This can be to register additional post types or taxonomies will your import process to write against, or do to additional hook registration to allow for things like nonce checks or password security functions.

API New: Support for providers to automatically import images into the WordPress media library (currently only supported by CollectionSpace, but coming to other providers soon!)

API New: Support for field remapping. (currently only supported by CollectionSpace, but coming to other providers soon!)

Providers can now provide a list of fields which are available to be remapped. If enabled, and the theme declares support for “cos-remaps” via [add\_theme\_support](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_theme_support) a list of all fields will be shown in the Culture Object settings page, and can be overridden by the user. As a theme developer, you should use cos\_get\_remapped\_field\_name(‘key’) in order to get the remapped name for a field.
