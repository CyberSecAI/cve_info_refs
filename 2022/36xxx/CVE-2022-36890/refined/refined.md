Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36890:

**CVE-2022-36890**

*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal
*   **Affected Plugin:** Deployer Framework Plugin
*   **Affected Versions:** 85.v1d1888e8c021 and earlier
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin does not restrict the name of files in methods implementing form validation.
*   **Weakness:** Improper input validation. Specifically, the plugin does not sanitize or validate the file paths provided during form validation.
*  **Attack Vector:** An attacker can craft a malicious file path in a form validation request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs `Item/Read` permission.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with `Item/Read` permission can check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.
*   **More Details:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to probe the file system of the Jenkins controller by sending requests with different file paths, effectively listing the file system of the controller.
*   **Fix:** Deployer Framework Plugin version 86.v7b\_a\_4a\_55b\_f3ec ensures that only files contained inside the expected directory can be accessed.

In summary, CVE-2022-36890 is a path traversal vulnerability where an attacker can probe for the existence of files on the Jenkins controller by manipulating file paths in form validation requests due to a lack of input validation within the Deployer Framework Plugin.
