Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `delete_waste` function of the `Master.php` file within the Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0. The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **SQL Injection:**  The `id` parameter in the `delete_waste` function is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
    
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, such as database name, table names, and user credentials. The provided payload demonstrates how to use `updatexml` to leak the database name.
- **Data Manipulation:** By crafting specific SQL injection payloads, an attacker could modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/isms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_waste`.
- **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Knowledge of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable file is `/isms/classes/Master.php`.
- The specific vulnerability is in the `delete_waste` function.
- The `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.
- The exploit uses `updatexml` to extract database information.
- The provided payload is: `id=3' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
