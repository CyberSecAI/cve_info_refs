- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection in the `update_user.php` file of the Clinic's Patient Management System v1.0. The `id` parameter in the URL is vulnerable to SQL injection because it is not properly sanitized before being used in a database query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability is present in the `/pms/update_user.php?id=` parameter
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific case, the provided payload demonstrates how to extract the database name.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests to `/pms/update_user.php` with a manipulated `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No specific position or capabilities beyond network access are mentioned.
