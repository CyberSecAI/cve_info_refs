Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36011:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a null dereference within the `mlir::tfg::ConvertGenericFunctionToFunctionDef` function in TensorFlow. This occurs when the function encounters an empty function attribute name.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Null Dereference:** The core issue is a null dereference when accessing `namedAttr.first` if it is an empty string during function attribute processing.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The code lacks validation for empty function attribute names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a crash by providing a crafted input with empty function attribute names. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition, causing the TensorFlow process to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `mlir::tfg::ConvertGenericFunctionToFunctionDef` function which processes function attributes.
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input that results in empty function attributes during the conversion process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a TensorFlow model with a function containing an empty attribute name which is then converted to MLIR via `mlir::tfg::ConvertGenericFunctionToFunctionDef`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit `1cf45b831eeb0cab8655c9c7c5d06ec6f45fc41b` addresses this vulnerability by adding a check for empty attribute names and returning an error if one is encountered.
- The vulnerability has been classified as "Low" severity.
- The fix has been included in TensorFlow versions 2.10.0, 2.9.2, 2.8.3, and 2.7.4.
