The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Simple Task Scheduling System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `/tss/admin/schedules/view_schedule.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database. The provided example uses the `length(database())` function to determine the length of the database name, demonstrating the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- An attacker may be able to modify or delete data in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessed via an HTTP GET request to `/tss/admin/schedules/view_schedule.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of SQL.
