Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `mlir::tfg::ConvertGenericFunctionToFunctionDef` function, specifically how it handles empty edge names during the import of TensorFlow functions. The function fails to properly validate input and return values which causes a crash due to an assertion failure when empty strings are used as edge names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of input validation:** The code did not check for empty strings in `ret_val.second` (result names) and `input` (node inputs) before using them, leading to a crash when these are empty.
*   **Assertion Failure**: The code doesn't properly handle cases where input and output edge names are empty, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker providing specially crafted TensorFlow models with empty edge names can cause the TensorFlow process to crash, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted TensorFlow Models:** An attacker can create malicious TensorFlow models which contain function definitions with empty strings for input or result names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted TensorFlow model to a system that uses the affected version of TensorFlow.

**More details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/ir/importexport/functiondef_import.cc` file.
*   The fix involves adding checks for empty input and result names, returning an `InvalidArgument` error when found, instead of crashing.
*   The commit `ad069af92392efee1418c48ff561fd3070a03d7b` patches this issue.
*   The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0, and it is patched in 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2 and 2.10.0.
*   The vulnerability is rated as **Low** severity.
