The provided content discusses two distinct memory-related issues in the `swfmill` software, as identified by AddressSanitizer:

**1. Allocation Size Too Big**

*   **Root Cause:** The software attempts to allocate a very large memory chunk, exceeding the maximum supported allocation size by the system.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** A lack of proper input validation or bounds checking allows the software to request an unreasonably large memory allocation.
*   **Impact:** The program crashes due to the allocation failure.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious SWF file could be crafted to trigger this allocation with a large size.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to provide a specially crafted SWF file to the vulnerable `swfmill` software for processing.

**2. Alloc-Dealloc Mismatch**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory block allocated with `operator new[]` is deallocated using `operator delete` (or vice-versa). This indicates a memory management error.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Incorrect memory management practice, specifically mismatched allocation/deallocation methods, leading to a heap corruption.
*   **Impact:** The program crashes due to heap corruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious SWF file can be crafted to trigger this memory mismatch.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to provide a specially crafted SWF file to the vulnerable `swfmill` software for processing.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided issue report includes example commands and AddressSanitizer outputs, showing where the crashes occur within the `swfmill` source code.
* The report also includes links to the specific example SWF files that can reproduce the issues.
* These issues are triggered during the processing of SWF files by `swfmill` when parsing or writing XML representations of the SWF file, specifically in `SWF::UnknownOpCode::parse` and `SWF::UnknownTag::writeXML`
* The issues were found using AddressSanitizer.
* The issue report also mentions the user is using a development version of llvm and swfmill.
