{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2022-36079",
    "description": "Internal fields (keys used internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields (user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and protected fields are removed by Parse Server from query results and are only returned to the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints, these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server returns a response object.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to use internal and protected fields as query constraints, which allows for enumeration and guessing of sensitive data, despite these fields being removed from query results.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Information exposure through query parameters"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact is that an attacker can potentially perform brute force guessing of user-sensitive data by crafting specific query constraints, thereby revealing information that should be protected.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through network requests by crafting specific queries to enumerate sensitive information.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They require the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.",
     "additional_info": "The fix requires a master key to use internal and protected fields as query constraints. A workaround using a 'beforeFind' cloud trigger to manually remove the query constraints is also provided."
