Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36647

**Root Cause:**
- A global buffer overflow occurs in the `parse_sequence_header()` function within the `davs2` video decoder. Specifically, the vulnerability is located at `source/common/header.cc:269`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `FRAME_RATE` array. The index used to access `FRAME_RATE` is derived from `seq->head.frame_rate_id - 1`. If `seq->head.frame_rate_id` is manipulated such that the resulting index is outside of the valid bounds of the `FRAME_RATE` array, an out-of-bounds read will occur.
- This out-of-bounds read is a global buffer overflow because the `FRAME_RATE` array is a global variable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The immediate impact is a crash due to the global buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service.
- The ASAN crash log shows that the out-of-bounds read occurs at address `0x555555956808`, which is located outside of the allocated memory for the `FRAME_RATE` array and near the `BETA_TABLE` array.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted AVS2 bitstream that contains an invalid `frame_rate_id` value in the sequence header. This crafted bitstream is then fed to the `davs2` decoder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted video file to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file.

**Additional Notes**
- The issue was identified by the user `arayzw` and fixed in commit `b41cf11`.
- The issue was assigned a CVSS score of 5.5, with an attack vector of local, low complexity, no privileges required, and user interaction being required, with a high impact to availability.
- The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-120 (Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input).
- The provided exploit PoC is a file named `poc1.avs`.
