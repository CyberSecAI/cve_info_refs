The provided content details a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C GR-1200W router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `addactionlist` function of the H3C GR-1200W router firmware. The `sscanf` function is used with the format specifier `%[^;]` to parse the `param` input. This format specifier matches any character except a semicolon, which leads to a greedy matching behavior. If the input data size exceeds the buffer size `V44`, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `addactionlist` function.
- Insecure use of `sscanf` with a greedy matching format specifier `%[^;]`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by overflowing the stack.
- An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address on the stack with a controlled value, leading to a stable root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=addactionlist` and a specially crafted `param` value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the H3C GR-1200W router's web interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router.

**Additional details:**

- The affected firmware version is `MiniGRW1A0V100R006` or earlier.
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) HTTP request demonstrating the stack overflow.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to gain a stable root shell on the device.
- The content shows images of the process information before and after the exploit is sent.
- The content describes how offset calculation can be used to cause denial of service.
