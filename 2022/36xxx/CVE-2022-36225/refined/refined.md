*   **Root Cause:** The EyouCMS v1.5.8 application lacks proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The application's column management function and member management functions (adding/deleting members) are vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This is evidenced by the successful use of a CSRF proof-of-concept (POC) to add test data.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request to the vulnerable application. This can be achieved through various methods like embedding the request in a malicious website, email, or other forms of social engineering.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTTP request targeting the vulnerable functionality of the application.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request.
