Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue.
*   The `name` parameter in the Pollers > Broker Configuration section of Centreon version 22.04.0 is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** User-supplied input is not properly sanitized or encoded when stored and later rendered in the web interface. Specifically, the `name` parameter in the broker configuration allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected page.
*   This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking by stealing cookies.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacement of the Centreon interface.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of Centreon.
*   Specifically, by navigating to `Pollers -> Broker Configuration` and adding a new broker configuration with a malicious payload in the "Name" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to the Centreon web interface.
*   The attacker must have the necessary privileges to access and modify the `Pollers > Broker Configuration` settings.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable page is located at `/centreon/main.get.php?p=60909`.
*   The specific payload used for testing is: `test"><body onload=prompt(document.cookie)>`

This payload demonstrates the ability to execute arbitrary Javascript (in this case displaying the cookies via `prompt(document.cookie)`) when the configuration is loaded in the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, which confirms the vulnerability.
*   The content specifies the tested version as Centos 7 with Centreon 22.04.0, which may be the only vulnerable version.
*   The content refers to the Centreon download site, but doesn't indicate if the vulnerability is fixed in newer releases.
