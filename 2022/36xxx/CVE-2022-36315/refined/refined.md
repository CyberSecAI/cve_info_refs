Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how Firefox handles Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks when a resource is preloaded using `<link rel="preload">` and then subsequently loaded via a `<script>` tag. Specifically, if a resource is preloaded with a stronger hash algorithm (e.g., SHA-512), a subsequent request for the same resource using a weaker algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) with an incorrect hash can bypass SRI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SRI Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass SRI checks.  Firefox incorrectly trusts a preloaded resource's integrity metadata for subsequent requests that have different (and weaker) integrity checks.
*   **Incorrect Hash Verification:** The browser fails to verify the integrity of the resource against the hash specified in the `<script>` tag, if a preloaded resource is available with a stronger hash.
*   **Subset Check Issue**: Firefox also only checks if the subset of hashes in the current SRI metadata is contained in the other SRI metadata. Therefore a load with an incorrect hash will be accepted as long as the preload also contains the wrong hash in addition to at least one correct hash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** An attacker who can inject a `<link rel="preload">` tag with a crafted resource and a strong hash could potentially force the browser to load that resource.  If the attacker is also able to influence the page to load the same resource via a `<script>` tag with a wrong, weaker hash, the malicious script would be executed, bypassing the intended security measures and possibly leading to arbitrary code execution within the website's context.
*   **Data Corruption:**  A successful bypass can allow an attacker to replace a legitimate resource with a malicious one.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Injection:** The primary attack vector is injecting a malicious `<link rel="preload">` tag into a web page. This could be achieved via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Preload abuse**: The preload mechanism is abused by providing a valid resource with a strong hash, and then loading the same resource with a wrong hash using a `<script>` or `<link>` tag.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Injection Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML (specifically the `<link rel="preload">` tag) into a target web page.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Resource:** The attacker must be able to host the malicious script that will be loaded, and have it available to the browser.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Hiroshige Hayashizaki.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the preload request uses the same hash and algorithm as the subsequent request, rather than merely checking the algorithm strength.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 103.
*   The fix was also backported to Firefox ESR 102.1.

In summary, CVE-2022-36315 is a low-severity vulnerability that can lead to a Subresource Integrity bypass via preload cache abuse if the attacker can inject a preload link into the page.
