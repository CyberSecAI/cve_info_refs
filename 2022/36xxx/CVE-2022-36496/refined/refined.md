- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `SetMobileAPInfoById` function of the H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router firmware due to the insecure use of `sscanf` with a greedy matching format specifier (`%[^;]`).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Stack overflow: The `sscanf` function with the format `%d%[^;];` reads data into a fixed-size buffer (`V7`). If the input string after the initial integer and up to the next semicolon is larger than the buffer, a stack buffer overflow occurs.
    - Insecure input handling: Lack of proper bounds checking when processing the input data within the `SetMobileAPInfoById` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the device to crash by sending an oversized input string that overwrites the stack, leading to process termination and service disruption.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): By carefully crafting the overflowed data, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical values on the stack and gain control of the execution flow, potentially leading to a stable root shell.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - HTTP POST request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specifically crafted POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint. The `CMD` parameter is set to `SetMobileAPInfoById` and the `param` parameter contains the malicious input string.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This would typically mean being on the same network as the device or having network access through other means (e.g., public-facing management interface).
    - Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters: The attacker needs to know the specific HTTP request parameters and format to exploit the stack overflow.

The provided content offers a detailed explanation and proof-of-concept of the stack overflow vulnerability, including:
