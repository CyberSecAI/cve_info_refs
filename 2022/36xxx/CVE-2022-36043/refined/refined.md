Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36043:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a double-free error within the `rz_bin_reloc_storage_free()` function in `bobj.c`, specifically when handling relocations generated by the QNX binary plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Double-free: The same memory is being freed twice, leading to memory corruption.
- Improper resource management: The code fails to properly track and manage memory allocated for relocations within QNX binaries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Exploiting the double-free can lead to memory corruption, which in turn can be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
- Program crash: As demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output, the immediate effect is a crash due to the double free

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious QNX Binary: An attacker needs to craft or modify a QNX binary that, when opened by a user via the vulnerable version of Rizin, triggers the double-free.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or modify QNX binaries.
- The attacker needs to have the victim user open the crafted QNX binary using a vulnerable version of Rizin.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located in `librz/bin/bobj.c:142`.
- The vulnerability was discovered during fuzzing.
- The issue was reported in GitHub issue #2964 and fixed by commit `a3d50c1ea185f3f642f2d8180715f82d98840784`.
- The fix involves changes in `librz/bin/p/bin_qnx.c`.
- The affected versions are <= 0.4.0 of rizin and the vulnerability is fixed in 0.4.1.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
