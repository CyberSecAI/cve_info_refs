The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Library Management System v1.0 by kingbhob02.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `RollNo` parameter within the `/LMS/staff/delstu.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or complete compromise of the database. In this specific instance, the attacker is able to leak the database name using the updatexml function.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through an HTTP POST request to `/LMS/staff/delstu.php` with a crafted `RollNo` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and understand SQL injection techniques.
