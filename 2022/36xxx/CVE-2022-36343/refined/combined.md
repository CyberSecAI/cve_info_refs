How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

**Enable SVG, WebP, and ICO Upload**

By default, WordPress does not allow uploading file formats like SVG, WebP, and ICO (in some hostings) citing security reasons. These files are becoming very popular and in fact, are recommended by popular web speed scan platforms like Google PageSpeed Insights or Gtmetrix to resolve the serve images in nextgen formats. Thus, this FREE PLUGIN will enable you to upload these files.

Simply install the plugin and your WordPress website now can easily accept media in SVG, WebP, and ICO format. You will also have an option to disable some or all images format (of the three) as required.

Dear All,
Here are the brief updates we’ve made to our plugins:
We have resolved all the security issues raised for the plugins, and they now eliminate all vulnerabilities.
We have removed the notices that appeared during plugin installation—everything has been resolved.
We have moved the plugin under “Settings,” removing unnecessary additions to the WordPress admin sidebar.
We will continue to make frequent updates to address any issues in the future.Thank you for your support 🙂

### [Enable SVG, WebP & ICO Upload <= 1.0.4 – Arbitrary File Upload](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/enable-svg-webp-ico-upload-1-0-4-arbitrary-file-upload/)

The Enable SVG, WebP & ICO Upload plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in versions up to 1.0.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site’s server which may make a potential remote code execution.
More information on the threat intel on the Wordfence website.

The plugin does what it should. But as long as why it needs to take up space in the admin panel. Until this item will be moved to the Settings submenu, I will unfortunately leave a bad review here because I find it unnecessary to have it in admin menu.
