Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36899:

**CVE-2022-36899**

*   **Root Cause:** The Compuware ISPW Operations Plugin defines a controller/agent message that retrieves Java system properties. The plugin does not restrict execution of this message to agents.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing access control:** The plugin fails to enforce restrictions on which processes can execute the controller/agent message used for retrieving Java system properties.
    *   **Agent-to-controller security bypass:** This allows an agent to request the execution of the controller/agent message on the controller, potentially exposing sensitive data.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has control over a Jenkins agent process can retrieve Java system properties from the Jenkins controller. This could expose sensitive information about the Jenkins controller environment.

*  **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to have control of a Jenkins agent process to send the crafted message to the Jenkins controller. This message would then execute on the controller, extracting the Java system properties and returning them to the agent.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to control a Jenkins agent process.
    *   The targeted Jenkins instance must be running Jenkins 2.318 or earlier, or LTS 2.303.2 or earlier.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specific to older Jenkins versions and is not exploitable in later versions due to changes made to agent-to-controller communication.
* The advisory also mentions that the fix for this vulnerability involves restricting the controller/agent message to not be executed by agents on the controller.
