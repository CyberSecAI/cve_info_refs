# Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection') and Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query ('LDAP Injection') and Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic in api/routes/posts.js

High

GHSA-3pv7-25cc-mjvv
Aug 19, 2022

## Package

npm

api/routes/posts.js
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

1.0.1

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

*If a database query (such as a SQL or NoSQL query) is built from user-provided data without sufficient sanitization, a malicious user may be able to run malicious database queries.*

### Patches

*Yet to be patched.*

### Workarounds

*Most database connector libraries offer a way of safely embedding untrusted data into a query using query parameters or prepared statements.*

*For NoSQL queries, make use of an operator like MongoDB's `$eq` to ensure that untrusted data is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object.*

### References

* *Wikipedia: [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)*
* *MongoDB: [$eq operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/eq)*
* *Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)*
* *Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html)*
* *Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-943](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/943.html)*
