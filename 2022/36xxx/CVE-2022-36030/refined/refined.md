- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands, LDAP queries, and data query logic within `api/routes/posts.js`. This arises when user-provided data is incorporated into database queries without adequate sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code suffers from SQL Injection (CWE-89), LDAP Injection (CWE-90), and Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic (CWE-943).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious users can inject arbitrary database queries. This could allow them to bypass security measures, modify or steal sensitive data, or even compromise the entire database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting malicious code into user-provided data that is subsequently used to construct database queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input that reaches the vulnerable database query construction logic in `api/routes/posts.js`.
