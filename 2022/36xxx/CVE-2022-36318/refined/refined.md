Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `nsDirectoryIndexStream` component, specifically in how it serializes directory indexes into plaintext. This component was found to be echoing URL parameters, such as query strings, directly into the output when displaying directory listings for `chrome://` URLs as source text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **URL Parameter Reflection:** The primary vulnerability is the reflection of URL parameters in the plaintext output. This could potentially lead to information disclosure, as sensitive data included in the URL could be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious URL with specific parameters. When a user views the source of the directory listing, the reflected parameters might reveal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker could construct a special URL with query parameters and convince the user to visit it.
- **Viewing Source:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the source code of a directory listing for `chrome://` URLs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to visit a crafted `chrome://` URL, particularly in scenarios where viewing the source of the page is relevant, as this reveals the vulnerability. No specific privileges are required besides being able to craft/share such a URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by modifying the `nsDirectoryIndexStream.cpp` to strip query parameters for `file`, `jar` or `chrome` URLs when generating the plaintext output. This prevents the reflection of potentially sensitive data passed through URL parameters.
- This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 103, Firefox ESR 91.12, Firefox ESR 102.1, and Thunderbird 91.12 and 102.1.
- The bug report explicitly states that the previous fix for a similar issue was only for HTML output, not the plaintext output.
- The bug report also mentions the fix is a small change to non-critical code, and that a manual test by QA is needed, which was done.

In summary, CVE-2022-36318 is a moderate severity vulnerability related to the reflection of URL parameters in plaintext directory listings within Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird, potentially leading to information disclosure.
