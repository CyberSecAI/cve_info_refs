The provided content relates to CVE-2022-36303.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of the 'type' parameter of uploaded files within the `UploadHandler.php` file. The file type is directly taken from user-controlled input and is later reflected back in the JSON response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS because the file type is not sanitized before being included in the JSON response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code by manipulating the 'type' field of an uploaded file. When the server echoes this unsanitized data in the JSON response, it allows for the execution of malicious code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a file with a crafted 'type' field containing malicious JavaScript.
- **JSON Response:** The server includes the unsanitized `type` field in the JSON response sent to the client.
- **Browser Execution:** The client's browser executes the malicious JavaScript contained in the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file's metadata, specifically the `type` field, during upload.
