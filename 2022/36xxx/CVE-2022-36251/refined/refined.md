The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Clinic's Patient Management System version 1.0.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it in the `patients.php` page. Specifically, the `address` field is echoed directly to the page without any form of encoding or validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed in the browsers of other users when they access the patients page. This could lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending a crafted POST request to `patients.php`, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `address` field which will be stored in the database.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit a POST request to the `/pms/patients.php` endpoint to inject the malicious script. They also need to know that the application is vulnerable and how to craft the malicious request with the payload that will execute on the victim's browser.
