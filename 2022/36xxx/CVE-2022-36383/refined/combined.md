This is a nice little Word Search plugin with basic functionality and a sleek user-interface for your end-user.

This is without a doubt the best word finder plugin out there. But there are some bugs.
Global options don’t work, wordsearch always have uppercase and lowercase mixed even when turned of… and I can’t disable the fact that a user is able to change the level size himself.

Everything looks great but there’s so much more to do in order to make this plugin usable. Basically there’s no way to play this on a computer. You can keep trying, and all of a sudden a word may be marked but 99% of the time no matter how much you try you cannot mark/strike/select a word. I didn’t try on mobile though. This is a great plugin concept but it needs to be usable. Hope the developer would take a little bit more time on this.

### [Very good!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/very-good-4606/)

Hi, just downloaded and set up on my WP site – works really well. Can I constructively suggest a minor development? As it stands the words you are searching for are always displayed. Can I suggest two options:
1) In the setup an option to not display the the words at all and they need to find them without being prompted to make it a bit harder
2) perhaps tied into this a counter that starts with the number of words they need to find and counts down to success.
3) Could be there is a toggle switch which by default doesn’t show the words but the user can toggle it on to show they words they are looking for – by doing so works for the differing levels that will be doing the challenge
Thanks again for a great plugin!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
