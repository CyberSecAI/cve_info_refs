Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `FileDumpController` in TYPO3 CMS, used to display stored files from the backend in both backend and frontend contexts, is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS). The vulnerability exists because the controller does not properly sanitize or escape the file content when rendering it for display.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is that the `FileDumpController` is susceptible to stored XSS. This means an attacker can upload a file containing malicious script code, which will then be executed in the browser of any user who views the file via the vulnerable controller.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization/Output Encoding:** The core issue is the absence of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the `FileDumpController` when processing and displaying files. This lack of security measures allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP) Bypass:** Files served via the `FileDumpController` bypass the web server's CSP settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the file through the `FileDumpController`.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Defacement:** Malicious scripts could alter the visual appearance of the affected TYPO3 page.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers might be able to extract sensitive information from the user's browser or the application's data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** An attacker needs to upload a file containing the malicious XSS payload to the TYPO3 CMS.
- **File Access via `FileDumpController`:** Users who view this file through the `FileDumpController` (either in the backend or frontend) will trigger the XSS vulnerability, which will execute the malicious JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Backend Access:** The attacker requires a valid backend user account to upload the malicious file. This position is needed to inject the malicious payload.
- **User Interaction (Indirect):** The attacker needs a user to interact with the malicious file via the `FileDumpController` to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in both backend and frontend contexts.
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a moderate severity with a CVSS score of 5.0.
- The fix involves updating to TYPO3 versions 7.6.58 ELTS, 8.7.48 ELTS, 9.5.37 ELTS, 10.4.32, or 11.5.16, which implement a fix applying a hardcoded Content Security Policy (CSP).
- The commit `bd58d2f` mitigates the vulnerability by applying a content-security-policy to the file to be dumped.
- The content-security-policy is applied based on the file extension. For PDFs the policy is: `default-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'none'; object-src 'self'; plugin-types application/pdf;` For other extensions the policy is `default-src 'self'; script-src 'none'; style-src 'none'; object-src 'none';`.

This vulnerability has been assigned CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).
