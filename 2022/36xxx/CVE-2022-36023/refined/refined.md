Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36023:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Hyperledger Fabric peer gateway service did not properly validate the fields of a signed proposal before extracting channel and chaincode information. This lack of validation allowed a malformed proposal to cause the peer service to crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation (CWE-20). Specifically, the gateway service was vulnerable to malformed proposals due to missing checks on proposal fields before using the data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful attack can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the peer node. This would render the peer unavailable and potentially disrupt network operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- A gateway client application can send a malformed request to a gateway peer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to a Hyperledger Fabric gateway peer. This could be an internal user or a malicious actor able to reach the peer's endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding validations to the gateway APIs to signal malformed proposals and return an error to the gateway client instead of crashing the peer.
- The fix was included in Hyperledger Fabric version 2.4.6 and backported to 2.5 and 2.4 branches.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Haosheng Wang of OPPO ZIWU Security Lab.
