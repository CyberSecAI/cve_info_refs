Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2022-36609:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection

**Root cause:** The `id` parameter in the `/pms/update_patient.php` script is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input (`id` parameter) before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Direct SQL Query Construction:** The application directly constructs SQL queries using user-supplied input, leading to the injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could use SQL injection to retrieve sensitive database information, including usernames, passwords, and other data related to patients and clinics.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify or delete data within the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exposed through an HTTP GET request by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `/pms/update_patient.php` script.
*   The attacker needs to understand basic SQL injection techniques.

**Technical details:**
* The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
* The database name is `pms_db`.
* The payload used is: `/pms/update_patient.php?id=-1%20union%20select%201,2,database(),4,5,6,7--+`
* The exploit allows an attacker to extract information like the database name (as shown by the `database()` function call).
