Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of an authorized user to update the `filename_disk` value in the `directus_files` table to a folder path. When this manipulated path is accessed through the `/assets` endpoint, it can cause the Directus process to terminate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `filename_disk` value, allowing users to input a folder path instead of a valid filename.
*   **Path Traversal/Manipulation:**  The ability to set `filename_disk` to a directory allows path manipulation that breaks expected application behavior when retrieving the asset.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to the termination of the Directus process, resulting in a denial of service. This can disrupt the application's availability and impact users relying on the service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **API endpoint:** The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `/assets` endpoint after modifying the `filename_disk` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the privilege to update the `filename_disk` field in the `directus_files` table. The advisory recommends that non-admin users should not have this permission.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker only needs low privileges to perform the attack, as long as they have the ability to update the `filename_disk` field.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.5.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.15.0.
*   The advisory suggests a workaround which is to restrict the permission to update `filename_disk` to trusted admins only.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2022-36031.
*   No CWEs (Common Weakness Enumerations) were provided in this security advisory.
