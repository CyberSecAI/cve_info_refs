The provided content relates to CVE-2022-36477.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a stack overflow in the `AddWlanMacList` function of the H3C B5 Mini B5MiniV100R005 router firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `sscanf` function is used with a greedy matching mechanism (`%u;%[^;];%[^;];`) to parse input data. This is insecure because if the input data exceeds the buffer size of `V5` or `V13`, a stack overflow occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve a stable root shell by exploiting the stack overflow with a carefully crafted payload. Additionally, the vulnerability can be used to cause a denial-of-service (DOS) attack by overwriting offsets.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=AddWlanMacList` and a long string in the `param` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the router's web interface. The specific request in the POC targets the `192.168.0.124` address, indicating that the attacker needs to be on the same network segment or have routing access to the router.
