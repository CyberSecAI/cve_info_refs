  "CVE-2022-36088": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "GoCD installations outside of the default location on Windows do not adequately restrict file permissions allowing local malicious users to modify executables and components.",
    "root_cause": "The NSIS installer for GoCD, when installing outside of the default location, does not properly set file permissions, leaving the installation directory and its contents with overly permissive permissions for the 'Everyone' user group.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate file permission restrictions on Windows installations outside of the default location."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user with local access can modify executables or components of the GoCD installation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the Windows machine where GoCD server or agent is installed."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs local access with low privileges. User interaction required, to install GoCD outside of `Program Files` directory",
    "patches": [
      "GoCD 22.2.0 and later includes the AccessControl plugin to correctly set permissions upon installation."
