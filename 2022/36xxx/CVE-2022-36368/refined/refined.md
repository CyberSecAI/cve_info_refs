{
  "CVE-2022-36368": {
    "Description": "The web user interface of IPFire provided by IPFire Project contains multiple stored cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input in the web interface, specifically in `mail.cgi` and `proxy.cgi`. This allows an attacker with administrative privileges to inject malicious scripts through email recipient fields and domain lists, which are then executed in the browser of another administrative user.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-79",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of another user, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data theft, or other malicious activities. Because the XSS is stored, the injected code can be triggered every time an administrator views the malicious data.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the IPFire system to inject malicious content. The attack requires user interaction (another administrator viewing the injected content).",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was reported by Satoshi Horikoshi and coordinated by JPCERT/CC. The fixes are included in IPFire 2.27 - Core Update 170. The affected versions are IPFire versions prior to 2.27 - Core Update 170. The vulnerability exists in `mail.cgi` and `proxy.cgi` due to improper input validation. Specifically, the email recipient field in `mail.cgi` and domain lists in `proxy.cgi` were not correctly validated. The CVSS v3 base score is 4.8, and the CVSS v2 base score is 3.5."
