Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the `Operation Log` functionality of ZKSecurityBio v4.1.3. The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the `Time` field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `Time` field, attackers can manipulate the database queries.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input sanitization, allowing special characters like single quotes to be injected, which is a typical SQL injection attack vector.
*   **Bypassable Filter:** While there was an attempt to filter input, the filter was bypassable using simple techniques like replacing spaces with comments (`/**/`).
*   **Vulnerable PostgreSQL Instance:** The application installs its own PostgreSQL instance which is vulnerable to the `COPY FROM PROGRAM` RCE trick.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server through the PostgreSQL database using the `COPY FROM PROGRAM` command. This allows the attacker to fully compromise the system.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** The SQL injection could also be used to access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The article mentions a prior privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2022â€“36634) that could be chained with this exploit for wider impact, though details are not fully specified.
*  **Physical Access Control Bypass:** While not the primary goal, the article notes the application is for "physical access control," implying doors could potentially be opened by an attacker who gains access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the ZKSecurityBio application. Specifically, the `Operation Log` functionality within the `System` menu.
*   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `Time` field.
* **Stacked Queries:** The attacker uses stacked queries, terminating the original query to inject additional commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server running ZKSecurityBio.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic SQL injection knowledge to craft and inject the malicious payloads.
*   **Application Knowledge:**  Some understanding of the ZKSecurityBio application's structure, particularly the vulnerable endpoint, was helpful. The attacker used application logs to construct a successful attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found during a Red Team exercise.
*   The researchers performed testing both on a live target and within a controlled environment.
*   The vendor was notified and has reportedly addressed the vulnerability.
*   The `COPY FROM PROGRAM` exploit leverages a vulnerable function in PostgreSQL that allows it to execute arbitrary system commands, leading directly to the RCE.
