The provided content discusses a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in wellcms version 2.2.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks CSRF protection when creating new users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability, specifically when adding a new user in the "manage users" section.
- The application doesn't validate the origin of the request, allowing an attacker to forge requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create a new user with administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The victim, while logged into the application, is tricked into visiting the malicious page, which triggers the forged request in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and the required parameters for adding a user.
- The attacker must be able to host the malicious page or otherwise trick a user into accessing the page while they are authenticated to the wellcms application.
