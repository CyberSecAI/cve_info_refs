The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C NX18 Plus NX18PV100R003 router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `EditWlanMacList` function uses `sscanf` with the format string `%u;%[^;];%[^;];` to parse user-provided input. The `%[^;]` format specifier performs a greedy match, reading input until a semicolon is encountered, without any length checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to uncontrolled buffer copy using `sscanf`.
- Insecure use of `sscanf` with unbounded string input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) by crashing the device.
- Potential to achieve a stable root shell by crafting a specific payload.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD=EditWlanMacList` parameter.
- The `param` value contains the overflowing data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the router.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and HTTP endpoint.
- Although not explicitly mentioned, it is implied that the attacker needs network access to the router.
