The provided content is related to CVE-2022-36695.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `delete_stockin` function within the `/isms/classes/Master.php` file of the "Ingredients Stock Management System v1.0" application. The `id` parameter, which is used in a SQL query, is directly taken from user input without sufficient validation or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the unsanitized `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: An attacker can use SQL injection to extract database information by exploiting the vulnerable parameter and using functions like `database()`.
- Unauthorized database access: An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data from the database if the application is connected to a privileged account.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the `/isms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_stockin` endpoint.
- Malicious payload within the `id` parameter: The attacker injects a malicious SQL query through the `id` parameter (e.g., `id=3' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to send HTTP POST requests: The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with a malicious payload to the vulnerable endpoint.
