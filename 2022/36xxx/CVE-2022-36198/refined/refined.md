Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the PHP code of the Bus Pass Management System. The application directly uses user-supplied input within SQL queries without any filtering or escaping, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (SQLi).  The following files are vulnerable:
* `buspassms/admin/view-enquiry.php`
* `buspassms/admin/pass-bwdates-reports-details.php`
* `buspassms/admin/changeimage.php`
* `buspassms/admin/search-pass.php`
* `buspassms/admin/edit-category-detail.php`
* `buspassms/admin/edit-pass-detail.php`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Bypass authentication and authorization.
*   Access sensitive data, including user information, pass details, and potentially administrative credentials.
*   Modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption or loss.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
*   Gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests (GET or POST) to the vulnerable PHP files with malicious SQL code injected into the input parameters:
*   `viewid` parameter in `buspassms/admin/view-enquiry.php`
*   `fromdate` and `todate` parameters in `buspassms/admin/pass-bwdates-reports-details.php`
*   `editid` parameter in `buspassms/admin/changeimage.php`
*   `searchdata` parameter in `buspassms/admin/search-pass.php`
*   `editid` parameter in `buspassms/admin/edit-category-detail.php`
*   `editid` parameter in `buspassms/admin/edit-pass-detail.php`
The PoCs provided show the use of `' or true-- -` to test for the vulnerability, a standard technique for detecting SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   No specific privileges or authentication are required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities. The injection points are directly accessible without any prior authentication.
