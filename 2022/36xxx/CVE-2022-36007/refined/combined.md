vuln-fix: Partial Path Traversal Vulnerability

```
This fixes a partial path traversal vulnerability.

Replaces `dir.getCanonicalPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalPath())`, which is vulnerable to partial path traversal attacks, with the more secure `dir.getCanonicalFile().toPath().startsWith(parent.getCanonicalFile().toPath())`.

To demonstrate this vulnerability, consider `"/usr/outnot".startsWith("/usr/out")`.
The check is bypassed although `/outnot` is not under the `/out` directory.
It's important to understand that the terminating slash may be removed when using various `String` representations of the `File` object.
For example, on Linux, `println(new File("/var"))` will print `/var`, but `println(new File("/var", "/")` will print `/var/`;
however, `println(new File("/var", "/").getCanonicalPath())` will print `/var`.

Weakness: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Severity: Medium
CVSSS: 6.1
Detection: CodeQL & OpenRewrite (<https://public.moderne.io/recipes/org.openrewrite.java.security.PartialPathTraversalVulnerability>)

# Partial Path Traversal in com.github.jlangch:venice

Moderate

[jlangch](/jlangch)
published
GHSA-4mmh-5vw7-rgvj
Aug 12, 2022

## Package

maven

com.github.jlangch:venice
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<= 1.10.16

## Patched versions

1.10.17

## Description

### Impact

A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths.

Assuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ "/Users/foo/resources" ]`

When passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine:

`(load-resource "test.png")` => loads the file "/Users/foo/resources/test.png"

`(load-resource "../resources-alt/test.png")` => rejected, outside the load path

When passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths:

`(load-resource "/Users/foo/resources/test.png")` => loads the file "/Users/foo/resources/test.png"

`(load-resource "/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png")` => loads the file "/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png" !!!

The latter call suffers from the *Partial Path Traversal* vulnerability.

This issue’s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `"/Users/foo/resources"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `"/Users/foo/resources-alt"`, but not from `"/Users/foo/images"`.

Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.16 are affected by this issue.

### Patches

Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.17, if you are on a version < 1.10.17

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the functions that can be used in Venice with a sandbox. If it is appropriate, the functions `load-file` and `load-resource` can be blacklisted in the sandbox.
