The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C B5 Mini B5MiniV100R005 router.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SetAPWifiorLedInfoById` function, where the `sscanf` function is used with the `%[^;]` format specifier to parse user input (`param`). This format specifier performs a greedy match, reading characters until a semicolon is encountered. If the input string is larger than the buffer allocated for `V11`, it results in a stack buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to insecure use of `sscanf` with a greedy format specifier.
- Lack of input validation or size limits, allowing an attacker to write past the bounds of the buffer `V11`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Overwriting the return address on the stack can crash the device.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By crafting a specific payload, attackers can gain a stable root shell on the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint. The request includes the `CMD=SetAPWifiorLedInfoById` and a long string as the `param` value to cause the buffer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, typically requiring network access to the device.
- The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to trigger the vulnerability.
