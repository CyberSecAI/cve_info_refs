Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied inputs when constructing SQL queries in the Java application. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection Vulnerability in several Java files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the underlying database.
- This could lead to data breaches, data modification, privilege escalation, or denial of service (depending on database privileges).

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Attackers can inject malicious SQL code through user-controlled parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable application's user interfaces.
-  The attacker needs to be able to input data that is used to create SQL queries.

**Affected Files (More details than CVE description):**
-   `UserDAO.java`
-   `Stocks.java`
-   `SupplierDAO.java`
-   `ProductDAO.java`
-   `CustomerDAO.java`
-   `ConnectionFactory.java`

**Vulnerable parameters (More details than CVE description):**
-   `UserDAO.java`: parameters such as `user`, `pass`
-   `CustomerDAO.java`: parameters such as `searchTxt`, `customercode`
-   `Stocks.java`: parameter `productcode`
-   `SupplierDAO.java`: parameter `searchTxt`
-   `ProductDAO.java`: parameter `searchTxt`
-   `ConnectionFactory.java`: parameters such as `username`, `password`, `user`

**Example PoC (More details than CVE description):**
-   Set value of parameters like `user`, `pass`, `searchTxt`, `customercode`, `productcode`, `username`, `password` in any of the affected files to  `' <SQL Query>--` to achieve SQL injection.
