The provided content relates to CVE-2022-36258.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization and the use of string concatenation when building SQL queries in multiple Java classes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple Java classes:
*   `UserDAO.java`: Parameters like 'user', 'pass' are vulnerable.
*   `CustomerDAO.java`: Parameters such as 'searchTxt', 'customercode' are vulnerable.
*   `Stocks.java`: Parameter 'productcode' is vulnerable.
*   `SupplierDAO.java`: Parameter 'searchTxt' is vulnerable.
*   `ProductDAO.java`: Parameter 'searchTxt' is vulnerable.
*   `ConnectionFactory.java`: Parameters such as 'username', 'password', and 'user' are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
*   Bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   Retrieve sensitive data from the database.
*   Modify or delete data in the database.
*   Potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server, depending on the database system and its configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the vulnerable parameters in the Java classes listed above. By injecting malicious SQL code into these parameters, an attacker can manipulate the database queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have the ability to provide input to the application through these vulnerable parameters. This likely means they have to be a user of the application or have direct access to the application, such as through its API, a web form, or similar input mechanism.
