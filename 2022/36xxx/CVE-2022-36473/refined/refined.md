The content provided describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C B5 Mini B5MiniV100R005 router.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Edit_BasicSSID_5G` function uses `sscanf` with a `%[^;]` format specifier to parse input into a buffer. This greedy matching mechanism, combined with insufficient bounds checking, allows an attacker to write past the allocated buffer, causing a stack overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack overflow due to insecure use of `sscanf` with an unbounded format specifier.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Denial-of-service (DoS) can be achieved by overwriting the return address on the stack and crashing the device.
    - Ability to obtain a stable root shell, by overwriting the return address with shellcode.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP POST request to `/goform/aspForm` with a crafted `param` value within the `CMD=Edit_BasicSSID_5G` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface.
    - It is implied that the attacker needs some form of authentication to access the vulnerable endpoint.
