## FAQ

### Images fail to loading

* Are you using Hostgator? Simply contact their support via phone or live chat to report mod security blockage. Send them the faulty link to a thumbnail.
* If you are not on Hostgator but getting 403 errors then try adding these lines to your .htaccess file in the WordPress installation folder. Revert the modification if it has no effect and contact the hosting’s support.

SecFilterEngine Off

SecFilterScanPOST Off

* Are you on Bluehost’s Optimized Hosting for WordPress? Make sure you turn off Varnish caching. It empties query strings.
* Open your .htaccess file and ensure you do not have this line in it:

php\_value mbstring.func\_overload 2

* Or something like this:

RewriteRule wp-content/plugins/(.\*.php)$ – [R=404,L]

* Make sure you have GD library. A possible error is “GD Library Error: imagecreatetruecolor does not exist – please contact your webhost and ask them to install the GD library”.
* iThemes Security (formerly Better WP Security) settings > System Tweaks > Configure Settings > Disable PHP in Plugins – Off. Also, System Tweaks > Filter Suspicious Query Strings – Disable.
* Sucuri Security plugin > 1-Click Hardening – Do not use it.
* WP All in ONE Security: WP Security > Firewall > Additional Firewall Rules (tabs at top of page) > Bad Query Strings – Untick.

  AND/OR WP Security > Firewall > 6G Blacklist Firewall Rules (tabs at top of page) > Enable 6G Firewall Protection – Untick.

### The layout doesnt’ look correct

Check the console of the browser and look if you see errors, if case please open a support ticket in our forum.

### Can I import galleries from other plugins?

Currently galleries made with Envira, FooGallery, Instagram, NextGen, JetPack, Modula, etc cannot be imported.

Can we do something with this issue?
Description
The Gallery PhotoBlocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the init() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete or copy photo galleries via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
Gallery PhotoBlocks <= 1.2.8 – Cross-Site Request Forgery

It is so easy to use with the freedom to size every picture as you wish. I also like the lightbar, so visitors can watch your pictures full size. Really great!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
