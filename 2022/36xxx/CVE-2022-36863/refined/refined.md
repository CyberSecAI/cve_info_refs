Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36863:

**1. Verification:**

   - The content mentions `SVE-2022-1079(CVE-2022-36863): A heap-based overflow vulnerability in libSDKRecognitionText.spensdk.samsung.so library` and describes it accurately.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a heap-based overflow vulnerability within the `GetCorrectDbLanguageTypeEsPKc` function of the `libSDKRecognitionText.spensdk.samsung.so` library.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Heap-based buffer overflow**: The vulnerability arises from a lack of proper boundary checks when handling data within the `GetCorrectDbLanguageTypeEsPKc` function. This can lead to writing beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - A successful exploit can cause a memory access fault, leading to a crash or potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - A local attacker can trigger the vulnerable code by crafting specific input to the library.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - The attacker needs local access to the device and the ability to influence the input to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is classified as having a "Moderate" severity.
-   The affected versions include devices running Android Q(10), R(11), and S(12).
-   The vulnerability was reported on April 28, 2022, and privately disclosed.
-   The fix involves adding proper boundary check logic to prevent the buffer overflow.
-   The patch was included in the SMR Sep-2022 Release 1.

In summary, CVE-2022-36863 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that can be exploited locally to cause a crash or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution in vulnerable Samsung devices. The patch adds proper validation to mitigate this risk.
