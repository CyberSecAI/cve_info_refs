Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36078:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way the `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` library handles slice decoding.
- When decoding data into a structure containing slices, the library directly reads the length of the slice from the input data without proper size validation. This allows an attacker to specify an extremely large size value.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unchecked Size Value:** The library doesn't validate the length of slices before allocating memory, which can lead to the allocation of an excessive amount of memory.
- **Memory Allocation Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is specifically a memory allocation vulnerability (CWE-789).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:** An attacker can cause the program to allocate an extremely large slice which consumes excessive amounts of memory, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The excessive memory allocation can crash the program due to lack of available memory, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Crash:** The allocation of very large memory can lead to program instability and crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Untrusted Input:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing data from untrusted sources (e.g., blockchain data) where the attacker can control the data.
- **Crafted Data:** The attacker crafts the input data to include a large value which is used as the length of a slice.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to control the input data that is decoded by the vulnerable library.
- The attacker can be an external entity providing the input data (e.g. interacting with a service using the library).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` prior to `v0.7.1`.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when calling `dec.Decode(&val)`, `binary.UnmarshalBorsh(&val, data)`, or `binary.UnmarshalBin(&val, data)`.
- The fix implemented in `v0.7.1` adds checks to limit the size of slice allocations.
- A workaround is to implement a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that validates the slice length prior to allocation.

In summary, CVE-2022-36078 is a memory allocation vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by crafting input data to allocate excessive amounts of memory through the `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` library.
