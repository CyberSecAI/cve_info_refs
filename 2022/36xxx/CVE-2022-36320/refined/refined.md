Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36320:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Memory safety bugs were present in Firefox 102, which could lead to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is memory corruption due to unspecified memory safety bugs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact is rated as "high". Successful exploitation of these memory safety bugs could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is not explicitly defined, but the vulnerability lies within the Firefox codebase itself. This would likely involve a malicious actor crafting specific input or exploiting browser behavior to trigger memory corruption.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to interact with the Firefox browser in a way that triggers the vulnerable code paths. This may involve crafting a malicious website, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the way the browser handles specific data.

**Additional Notes:**
