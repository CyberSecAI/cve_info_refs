Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `del.php` file. Specifically, the `M_Id` parameter, which is used in a SQL query, is not sanitized and is directly inserted into the SQL query, creating an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability in the `del.php` file. The code is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user input in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Database Information Disclosure: An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. The provided exploit demonstrates the ability to determine the name of the database.
- Potential for Data Manipulation: Depending on the database privileges, the attacker can further modify the database, potentially deleting or inserting data.
- Complete system compromise: By exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, an attacker can potentially gain access to the underlying operating system, or other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a malicious POST request to the `/LMS/admin/del.php` endpoint with a crafted `M_Id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
- Understanding of SQL: The attacker must have a basic understanding of SQL and SQL injection techniques to craft the malicious payload.
- Knowledge of application path: The attacker needs to know the endpoint that is vulnerable. In this case, it's `/LMS/admin/del.php`.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit uses `updatexml` function to extract data, which is a common technique for SQL injection attacks.
- The provided payload shows how to determine the database name.
- The vulnerable application is identified as "Library Management System v1.0 by kingbhob02"
