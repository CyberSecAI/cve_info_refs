Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-36358:

**Root Cause:**
The WordPress plugin "SEO Scout: Content Optimization, Keyword Research, Rank Tracking + SEO Testing" (identified as `ab-rankings-testing-tool` ) is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to potentially force a logged-in user to perform unintended actions on the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could lead to an attacker forcing a privileged user (e.g., an administrator) to execute actions they did not intend.
- Specific impact varies depending on the plugin's functionality, but it could potentially lead to changes in website content, settings, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into initiating the request. This can be achieved through social engineering tactics like sending phishing emails with malicious links.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the target website.
- They need to be able to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges into executing a crafted request.
- The attacker needs a user with the right permissions on the site to be logged in to perform actions, since this vulnerability is CSRF, not related to authentication bypass.
