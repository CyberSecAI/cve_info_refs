Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-36965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the Quality of Experience (QoE) application's input fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts can be stored within the application's data.
*   **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious scripts are injected into the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page, potentially executing within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the QoE application. This can lead to:
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** If an administrator views the injected malicious script, an attacker may gain higher level access in the SolarWinds Platform.
    *   **Data Theft:** Attackers might be able to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information from users who interact with the affected application.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Attackers might use the vulnerability to redirect users to malicious websites or force downloads of malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Attackers could alter the appearance or content of the affected application, damaging the credibility of the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves the injection of malicious scripts through the QoE application's input fields. An attacker needs to input their malicious payload in the vulnerable field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated session to access the vulnerable QoE application and interact with the input fields.
*   **User Interaction:**  While the vulnerability is stored, the attacker would need another user to interact with the injected payload to be executed.
