Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36095:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of CSRF token validation when adding or removing tags on XWiki pages through specific URL requests. While the CSRF token was included in the form, it was not being validated on the server-side, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is a CSRF vulnerability. The application fails to validate the CSRF token, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests to add or remove tags from XWiki pages on behalf of a logged-in user, without the user's consent or knowledge.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized tag manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to add or remove arbitrary tags on XWiki pages. This can lead to data manipulation and defacement of the content of the wiki.
- **Potential for further attacks:** While the immediate impact is tag manipulation, this could potentially be used as a stepping stone for more severe attacks, depending on how tags are used within the XWiki application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can craft a malicious request and trick a logged-in XWiki user into executing it, for example by embedding a link or an image in a malicious website or email.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction. The victim needs to be logged into the XWiki application and click on a malicious link or load a malicious page that contains the forged request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Knowledge of XWiki structure:** The attacker needs to understand the structure of XWiki's URL parameters for tag manipulation.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to be able to generate malicious HTTP requests that the victim will inadvertently trigger.
- **Ability to deliver the attack:** The attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious request to a logged-in victim. This could be through phishing, malicious websites, or other means.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the `documentTags.vm` template was not properly validating the CSRF token when handling tag addition and removal requests.
- The issue was found to be present in XWiki versions up to 13.10.5 and 14.3.
-  A patch is available in XWiki versions 13.10.5 and 14.3
- A workaround was provided by modifying the documentTags.vm template.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 4.3
- The vulnerable requests use the `xpage=documentTags` parameter with `xaction=add` or `xaction=delete`.
- The fix involves checking the validity of the `form_token` parameter before modifying the tags.
