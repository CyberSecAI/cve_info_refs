Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `edoc-doctor-appointment-system` application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-provided input in the patient search functionality, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. Malicious scripts provided by the attacker are reflected back to the user through the search functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal or modify authentication information of the user, such as session cookies.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially modify data, deface the web page, or redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input to the search field in the patient module (`/patient/index.php`).
- **Reflected Payload:** The malicious JavaScript payload is embedded in the search query and is reflected back in the response, executing in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject malicious script:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the search field of the vulnerable application, which usually can be done by crafted URL or form data manipulation.
- **Target User Access:** The target user needs to visit the crafted URL or utilize the malicious form data that injects the malicious script into the search field within the vulnerable page to be exploited.
