Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36046

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by specific requests to the Next.js server which causes an `unhandledRejection`.
- This `unhandledRejection` can crash the server process in certain Node.js versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unhandled Promise Rejection: The core issue is an unhandled promise rejection within the Next.js server. This means that an asynchronous operation failed, and the error was not caught properly, leading to the unhandled rejection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Server Crash: The most significant impact is that the Next.js server can crash. In Node.js versions where unhandled rejections cause the process to exit, this can lead to service disruptions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Specific HTTP Requests: The vulnerability is triggered by sending specific requests to the Next.js server. The details of exactly which requests are not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Next.js server.
- Understanding of Trigger Conditions: An attacker would need knowledge of the specific requests that trigger the vulnerability, which are not specified in the provided text.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Environment:**
    - Node.js versions above v15.0.0 with strict `unhandledRejection` handling.
    - Next.js version v12.2.3.
    - Using `next start` or a custom server.
- **Not Affected Environments:**
    - Deployments on Vercel.
    - Environments where `next-server` isn't being shared across requests.
- **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in Next.js version 12.2.4.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an unhandled promise rejection in Next.js v12.2.3 that can be triggered by specific HTTP requests. If the server runs on a Node.js environment with strict unhandled rejection exiting (v15.0.0 and above), the server crashes.
