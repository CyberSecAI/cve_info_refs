The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the H3C B5 Mini B5MiniV100R005 router.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `SetAP5GWifiById` function uses `sscanf` with the `%[^;]` format specifier to parse user-provided input (`param`). This greedy matching mechanism reads data until a semicolon is encountered, without proper bounds checking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing user-supplied input in the `SetAP5GWifiById` function.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial-of-service (DoS): By overflowing the stack, an attacker can cause the device to crash, preventing normal operation.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker can gain a stable root shell by crafting a specific payload that overwrites return addresses on the stack.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD` parameter set to `SetAP5GWifiById` and the `param` parameter containing a string that exceeds the buffer size on the stack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device. This usually implies network access to the device. The attacker also needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.
