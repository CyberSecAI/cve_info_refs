Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-36532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation during file uploads in Bolt CMS versions 5.1.12 and below. While the CMS restricts direct uploads of `.php` files, it allows other extensions like `.txt`. However, the file edit functionality allows modification of the file path, including renaming the extension of the file after upload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Upload:** The CMS allows uploading files with non-executable extensions.
*   **File Path Manipulation:** The file editing functionality does not properly sanitize the file path, allowing users to rename the extension of files, which bypasses the initial upload restrictions.
*   **Lack of Extension Validation on File Rename:** When editing a file the extension is not checked allowing a rename to a php file extension.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a file with a non-executable extension (like .txt) containing PHP code and then renaming it to a `.php` file, an attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File Upload:** Attacker uploads a file with a non-executable extension (e.g. .txt) with malicious PHP code.
*  **HTTP Request Interception:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP request while editing a file.
*   **File Rename:** The attacker modifies the HTTP request by manipulating the `file` parameter to change the file extension to `.php` during a file edit/save action.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** The attacker can access the renamed `.php` file through a browser request, executing the embedded PHP code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Bolt CMS instance.
*   **Editor Role (`ROLE_EDITOR`):** The user account must have the `ROLE_EDITOR` privilege, which grants access to the file management and editing functionality.
*   **Web Browser:** The attacker needs a web browser or similar tool to interact with the Bolt CMS interface and intercept/modify HTTP requests.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Bolt CMS version 5.1.13.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) script was created and published by Lutra Security to demonstrate the vulnerability.
