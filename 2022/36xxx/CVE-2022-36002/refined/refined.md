Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `Unbatch` operation in TensorFlow not properly validating the input `id`. It expects a scalar value for `id`, but if a non-scalar tensor is provided, it leads to a `CHECK` failure, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of the `id` input within the `Unbatch` operation. It does not verify if the input is scalar, leading to the crash.
- **Denial of Service:**  The `CHECK` failure triggers a program termination, which can be exploited by providing a non-scalar `id` to the `Unbatch` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit can crash the TensorFlow program/service using the `Unbatch` operation, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Input Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a non-scalar tensor as input for the `id` parameter to the `tf.raw_ops.Unbatch` or `batch_ops.unbatch` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the TensorFlow `Unbatch` operation.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or to be local to the system. They just need to be able to supply the malformed input.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 and also affects versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x, and 2.9.x.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the input `id` is indeed a scalar.
- The fix was included in commit `4419d10d576adefa36b0e0a9425d2569f7c0189f`.
- Patched versions are 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
