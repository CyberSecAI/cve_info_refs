- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Connection handler in Hazelcast and Hazelcast Jet allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access and manipulate data in the cluster with another authenticated connection's identity. This is due to improper handling of connections leading to connection caching issues.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper connection handling, leading to an unauthenticated user being able to use an authenticated connection's identity.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can access and manipulate data within the cluster with the identity of an authenticated connection.
- **Attack vectors:** Network based attacks
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Hazelcast or Hazelcast Jet cluster via the network, no authentication is required.
