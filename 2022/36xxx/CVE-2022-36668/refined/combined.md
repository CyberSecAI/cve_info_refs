 [![](/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images/mayuri_k/Dashboard.jpg?itok=tjNYkmtw)](/sites/default/files/images/mayuri_k/Dashboard.jpg)

This is **Garage Management System** using **PHP/MySQL** with Source Code the project is available for free download. Garage management software helps you to manage all your vehicles, cars, and motorcycles. It provides you with a complete garage management solution that enables you to check the status of your vehicles and motorcycles, tracks their billing, monitor their usage, and generate reports on the usage on a daily basis or date durations. You can use this software to manage your vehicles on the go in the most hassle-free and convenient way. It also gives you advanced features that will help you in managing your vehicle during servicing in the garage. If you are planning to buy one of the best garage management software then you can go with my Advance garage management software which is the next version of this software.

**Here is the Login Form Design of the Garage Management System**

![](/sites/default/files/images/mayuri_k/login%20form_0.jpg) The automobile industry is one of the most important industries in the world. It is responsible for generating a lot of revenue and creating jobs. The automobile industry is going through a transformation phase, which will result in significant changes to the way cars are sold and used.

The automotive industry has been changing rapidly over the past few decades, with new technologies, new business models, and new regulations coming into play. This has resulted in a number of challenges for all stakeholders involved with this sector: car manufacturers; car dealers; consumers; government agencies that regulate vehicle safety standards; and software companies that develop automobile software (e.g., navigation systems). As such, there are many areas where automotive technology can be applied to improve productivity or efficiency: autonomous driving systems (e.g., self-driving cars);

**Here is the Billing Form Design of Garage Management Software**

![](/sites/default/files/images/mayuri_k/billing.jpg)

This software is meant for the owners of garages who are thinking about making their workshop repair service center computerized. This software can be installed easily on your computer and laptop without any installation issues only they must have knowledge of the basic configuration of PHP project. The advantage of this software is that it comes with both modes i.r cloud-based infrastructure or you can use with offline i.e localhost that helps you to use it offline without any internet connection.

Garage management software is a very useful tool to optimize the process of managing your workshop. In this Workshop management software, we can see Garage Management Software (GMS) working. GMS is used by garage owners and garage managers to manage their workshops in a more efficient way. It is also used by companies that want to increase their productivity and reduce costs.

**Video Demo of Garage management system in PHP**

We should not think of these GMS as a replacement for human garage managers. They just provide assistance to the garage owners and garage managers by automating some tasks that they need to do on a daily basis like maintaining records of parts and their categories, generating job cards, invoicing, and printing.

Note: Due to the size or complexity of this submission, the author has submitted it as a .zip file to shorten your download time. After downloading it, you will need a program like Winzip to decompress it.

Virus note: All files are scanned once-a-day by SourceCodester.com for viruses, but new viruses come out every day, so no prevention program can catch 100% of them.

FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, PLEASE:

1. Re-scan downloaded files using your personal virus checker before using it.

2. NEVER, EVER run compiled files (.exe's, .ocx's, .dll's etc.)--only run source code.
