Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A bug in Grafana's role-based access control (RBAC) migration process. When RBAC is enabled, Grafana migrates legacy access control permissions to RBAC permissions. This migration process incorrectly grants additional access to folders/dashboards that previously only had Admin permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows users with lower privileges (Editors and Viewers) to gain unauthorized access to folders/dashboards that were intended to be restricted to Admin users only.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The RBAC migration logic fails to properly map legacy access controls, leading to unintended access being granted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized users can view sensitive information in dashboards and folders.
- **Integrity compromise:** Unauthorized users can modify or delete dashboards/folders.
- **Availability Impact:** The unauthorized modification or deletion of dashboards/folders may impact the availability of services which rely on these resources.
- The provided CVSS score is 6.4 (Moderate) on a v3.1 scale

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- Exploitable by a user with low privileges

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a valid user account with low privileges (Editor or Viewer).
- The attacker must be on a Grafana instance where RBAC was enabled at least once, and there are folders/dashboards with only Admin grants.
- No user interaction is required for successful exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability affects Grafana instances using role-based access control (RBAC).
- The vulnerability is present in Grafana versions >= 8.5.0 and < 8.5.13, >= 9.0.0 and < 9.0.9, >= 9.1.0 and < 9.1.6.
- Patched versions are 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6.
- A workaround exists where affected folder/dashboard permissions can be manually corrected.
