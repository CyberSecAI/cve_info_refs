## Privilege escalation ([CVE-2022-36062](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p978-56hq-r492 "CVE-2022-36062"))

### Summary

On August 29 we have received a bug report for Grafana role-based access control (RBAC) and confirmed a vulnerability in the Grafana. This vulnerability impacts folders/dashboards with Admin only permissions and where RBAC was ever enabled at least once.

When RBAC is enabled, Grafana runs migrations which translate legacy access control permissions into RBAC permissions. The migrations contain a bug, which grants additional access to folders/dashboards which only had Admin role grant, resulting in a privilege escalation where Editors can edit and Viewers can view the folder/dashboard which they should not have access to.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).

### Impacted versions

All Grafana installations where the [RBAC](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/) was at least enabled once and there are folders/dashboards with only Admin grant.

### Solutions and mitigations

To fully address [CVE-2022-36062](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p978-56hq-r492 "CVE-2022-36062") please upgrade your Grafana instances. They are only required if you have ever enabled RBAC and have dashboards/folders where Admin is the only permission..

If you can’t upgrade, as a workaround when impacted folder/dashboard is known, the additional permissions can be removed manually.

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).

### Timeline

Here is a timeline starting from when we originally learned of the issue.

* 2022-08-27: External report received about a bug in Grafana role-based access control.
* 2022-08-30: The bug is confirmed as a vulnerability.
* 2022-08-31: Mitigation is applied to Grafana Cloud.
* 2022-08-31: Release timeline determined: 2022-09-06 for private customer release, 2022-09-20 for public release.
* 2022-09-06: Private release.
* 2022-09-20: Public release.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

## Privilege escalation ([CVE-2022-36062](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p978-56hq-r492 "CVE-2022-36062"))

### Summary

On August 29 we have received a bug report for Grafana role-based access control (RBAC) and confirmed a vulnerability in the Grafana. This vulnerability impacts folders/dashboards with Admin only permissions and where RBAC was ever enabled at least once.

When RBAC is enabled, Grafana runs migrations which translate legacy access control permissions into RBAC permissions. The migrations contain a bug, which grants additional access to folders/dashboards which only had Admin role grant, resulting in a privilege escalation where Editors can edit and Viewers can view the folder/dashboard which they should not have access to.

The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.4 Moderate (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).

### Impacted versions

All Grafana installations where the [RBAC](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/roles-and-permissions/access-control/) was at least enabled once and there are folders/dashboards with only Admin grant.

### Solutions and mitigations

To fully address [CVE-2022-36062](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p978-56hq-r492 "CVE-2022-36062") please upgrade your Grafana instances. They are only required if you have ever enabled RBAC and have dashboards/folders where Admin is the only permission..

If you can’t upgrade, as a workaround when impacted folder/dashboard is known, the additional permissions can be removed manually.

Appropriate patches have been applied to [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
