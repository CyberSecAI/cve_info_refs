  "CVE-2022-36982": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files on affected installations of Ivanti Avalanche. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the AgentTaskHandler class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored session cookies, leading to further compromise.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path before using it in file operations within the AgentTaskHandler class.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary file read, disclosure of stored session cookies, leading to further compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote network access.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs to bypass authentication, which is possible, and provide a malicious path.",
     "Additional details": "The advisory indicates that authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability but the existing authentication can be bypassed."
