This vulnerability allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files on affected installations of Ivanti Avalanche 6.3.3.101. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the AgentTaskHandler class. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored session cookies, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-15967.
