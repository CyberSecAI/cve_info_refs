# Recovery codes abuse

Moderate

[drakkan](/drakkan)
published
GHSA-54qx-8p8w-xhg8
Sep 1, 2022

## Package

gomod

sftpgo
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= v2.2.0, < v2.3.4

## Patched versions

v2.3.4

## Description

### Impact

SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP (Time-based One Time Passwords) as a seconday authentication factor. Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost, stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP.

In SFTPGo versions from v2.2.0 to v2.3.3 recovery codes can be generated before enabling two-factor authentication.

An attacker who knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on the account at a later time.

### Patches

Fixed in v2.3.4.

Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it.

### Workarounds

Regenerate recovery codes after enabling two-factor authentication.

### References

[#965](https://github.com/drakkan/sftpgo/issues/965)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-36071

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

| **Area** Web Client MFA /web/client/mfa  **Summary** Not sure if this is the expected behaviour, but a user required to use MFA has the option to generate recovery codes even before configuring and enabling it on account . This option is available after logging in with username / password. This means an attacker that knows the user's password could potentially generate a bunch of recovery codes bypassing 2FA after it enabled on account at a later date.  **Steps to reproduce as Admin** As an Admin create a new account for a user with a password but enable requirement for MFA.  **Steps to reproduce the behavior user:**  The user logs into the webclient and will get this page  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8626343/187489807-fc73806c-9d63-4bbe-b0fe-dc49dcc2f094.png)  on all other options when the user clicks they get image above  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8626343/187489980-d6a82579-0515-4b48-a388-9004c80095fa.png)  Scroll to bottom and click Generate codes and store it for later.
