Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36885:

**CVE-2022-36885**

*   **Root Cause:** The GitHub Plugin does not use a constant-time comparison when checking the equality of provided and computed webhook signatures.
*   **Weaknesses:** Non-constant time comparison of webhook signatures.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially use statistical methods to obtain a valid webhook signature. This could allow them to potentially bypass signature verification and execute actions that would normally be protected by the signature.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network access to the Jenkins instance where the vulnerable GitHub Plugin is installed.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Jenkins webhook endpoint exposed by the Github plugin.
    *   The attacker needs to have some knowledge about the expected structure and generation of webhook signatures in order to craft appropriate requests to exploit the vulnerability.
    *  The attacker requires low privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in GitHub Plugin versions 1.34.4 and earlier.
*   The fix is available in version 1.34.5 which uses a constant-time comparison for webhook signature validation.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is low (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)
