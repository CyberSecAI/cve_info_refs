Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-36900:

**Vulnerability:** Agent-to-controller security bypass in Compuware zAdviser API Plugin

**Root Cause:**
The Compuware zAdviser API Plugin defines a controller/agent message that retrieves Java system properties. The plugin does not restrict the execution of this message to agents, allowing it to be triggered from the controller itself.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lack of proper access control: The plugin fails to restrict the execution of the Java system property retrieval message to agents, which is the intended behavior. This allows a controller process to trigger the message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers who have control over an agent process can retrieve Java system properties from the Jenkins controller. These properties could potentially contain sensitive information about the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control an agent process connected to the Jenkins controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to control the execution of processes running on a Jenkins agent, which can be achieved through various means depending on the environment, such as exploiting vulnerabilities on the agent machine or gaining control via compromised credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, as well as LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Compuware zAdviser API Plugin 1.0.4 and later by preventing the controller from executing the message.
