{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The jsoup library's cleaner incorrectly sanitizes crafted XSS attempts when `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` is enabled. This occurs because the Java URL class used to resolve relative URLs treats control characters in the URL as part of a relative path and does not sanitize them, while browsers may normalize and execute javascript URLs, leading to an XSS opportunity.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-87)"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful XSS attack can lead to disclosure of sensitive information or modification of data on websites that use the vulnerable jsoup library to sanitize HTML input when they have enabled the `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option and have no Content Security Policy in place. An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the HTML, which is then executed by the victim's browser.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious javascript URLs within the href attribute that contains control characters, bypassing the sanitation checks performed by jsoup, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to submit crafted HTML containing javascript URLs with control characters. The target application must be using jsoup with the `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option enabled, and must not have an appropriate Content Security Policy defined to prevent javascript execution. The attacker needs no specific privileges on the system other than the ability to post content on the vulnerable site, and requires some user interaction to be triggered."
