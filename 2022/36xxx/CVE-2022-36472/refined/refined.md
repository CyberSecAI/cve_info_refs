Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack overflow vulnerability exists in the `SetMobileAPInfoById` function of the H3C B5 Mini B5MiniV100R005 router. The vulnerability is caused by using `sscanf` with a greedy matching format string `%[^;]`. This format string reads all characters until a semicolon is encountered, without any size limitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack Overflow:** The `sscanf` function writes the parsed input to a buffer `V16` on the stack. Since the input (`param`) is read greedily until a semicolon, if its size exceeds the buffer's capacity, a stack overflow occurs.
*   **Unsafe input handling**: The function uses `sscanf` without a size limit, making it vulnerable to buffer overflows.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the stack, an attacker can cause a crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** With further crafting of the overflow payload, a stable root shell can be obtained without authorization, which means the attacker could gain complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/aspForm` endpoint with the `CMD` parameter set to `SetMobileAPInfoById` and a crafted `param` value that causes a stack overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the H3C router, as the attack vector is through HTTP requests.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint/parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint (`/goform/aspForm`) and the vulnerable parameter (`CMD=SetMobileAPInfoById`).

**Additional Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The provided content shows the specific vulnerable function (`SetMobileAPInfoById`) and the vulnerable code snippet (`sscanf(V8, "%[^;]", V16)`).
*   A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit is provided in the form of a crafted HTTP POST request.
*   The attacker can cause a DoS or gain a root shell on the router by sending the crafted POST request.
*   The exploit works by sending an overly long string of 'A's as the 'param' value, causing the `sscanf` function to overflow the buffer.
