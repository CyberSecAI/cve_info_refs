Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36222:

**CVE-2022-36222**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded default administrative credentials in specific firmware versions of the Nokia Fastmile device.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary weakness is the presence of a hardcoded password (`Nq+L5st7o`) for the 'admin' user account. This allows anyone with knowledge of these credentials to gain administrative access.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device's web interface. This access can be used to modify settings, potentially disrupting network operation or gaining further access to the device itself by leveraging other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface's login page. An attacker needs to input the username 'admin' and the hardcoded password.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to reach the web interface of the Nokia Fastmile device. This could mean being on the same network as the device, or potentially through remote access if such access is exposed.
    *   The attacker must have knowledge of the hardcoded 'admin' password.
    *   The vulnerability is present in firmware versions 3TG00118ABGA17 and below.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The blog post provides specific firmware versions affected, including:
    *   3TG00118ABGA17
    *   Older versions below 3TG00118ABGA17.
*   The blog also mentions that versions after 3TG00118ABGA17 appear to use a different password (`F1P3@s+6!H`), although the author couldn't fully validate it.
*   The author notes that this vulnerability is no longer available in firmware versions with U-Boot Aug-09-2022--20:45:33 or later (specifically patch version 3TG00118ABGA31).
