The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Library Management System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of the `bookId` parameter in the `/LMS/librarian/delete.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists in the `bookId` parameter when deleting a book.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by manipulating the `bookId` parameter.
- In this specific example, the attacker is able to extract the database name using the `updatexml` function and `select database()` query. This can be used to leak sensitive information from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/LMS/librarian/delete.php`, manipulating the `bookId` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned, implying that the vulnerability might be accessible to unauthorized users.
