How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

#### Important disclaimer

This plugin loads JavaScript libraries from external amCharts CDN which is a free **service** provided by amCharts.

amCharts provides their libraries completely free without any caps to functionality on a sole condition, that small contribution is automatically displayed on all chart produced by amCharts library. The contribution comes from amCharts libraries/service and is not added by this plugin.

Related links:

\* [Free usage terms / license of the amCharts library](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts4/blob/master/dist/script/LICENSE)

\* [amCharts privacy policy](https://www.amcharts.com/privacy-policy/)

#### What is it?

Ever tried getting JavaScript content into your WordPress posts or pages? Yeah, that’s impossible. WP strips down all

the JavaScript.

This makes adding JavaScript Charts and Maps a hassle.

Developed and maintained by amCharts staff, this plugin solves the problem by allowing you to create chart code snippets, that then subsequently can be inserted into the

posts or pages as a shortcode. (helpful button in TinyMCE is also there)

You can also use a built-in PHP function to invoke the chart anywhere in your template:

```
<?php amcharts_insert( $chart_id ); ?>

```

The plugin has also many helpful functions:

* Easy switching between CDN-hosted or local chart/map libraries storage
* Setting defaults per chart type
* Automatically locating installed libraries and available resources

## Screenshots

  Plugin configuration. Either use amCharts-hosted free libraries or your own. Set default code per chart/map type.

  Easily create new charts or maps using presets right from the Admin menu.
* [![](https://ps.w.org/amcharts-charts-and-maps/assets/screenshot-3.png?rev=886655)](https://ps.w.org/amcharts-charts-and-maps/assets/screenshot-3.png?rev=886655)

  Modify resources, HTML or JavaScript portion of the chart. Or apply defaults right from the edit screen.

  Insert chart easily into body of the post or page using button from the rich editor tool belt. The charts are inserted as Wordpress shortcodes.

  Select from the available charts or maps. No coding required.

  Embed a chart created in Live Editor directly into your posts or pages.

  The chart shortcodes are replaced with the actual charts when page renders.

## Installation

Use WordPress Plugin page to search and install the amCharts plugin.

If you choose to install in manually, make sure all the files from the downloaded archive are placed into your `/wp-content/plugins/amcharts/` directory.

## FAQ

### Does this plugin work with the free/commercial versions of amCharts libraries?

Yes. You can either set the plugin to use publically available libraries loaded from www.amcharts.com or from your local server.

### Which version of amCharts library does the plugin use?

Plugin will use amCharts 5 when installed anew. You are able to switch between versions in plugin’s settings.

### Will I be able to visually edit settings and data?

No. This plugin allows editing a code directly in WordPress admin as well as inserting the charts into posts or pages using shortcodes.

It’s not a fully fledged chart/map editor. It’s a plugin designed to get your chart/map code into WordPress easily.

### Do I need to include any JavaScript libraries in my theme code?

Nope. The plugin will take care of that for you. The required JavaScript libraries will be included in the footer of the page automatically.

Plugin will include only those libraries that are actually required to render the chart. If no charts are there on the page, no additional libraries will be included.

Let’s keep the footprint small 😉

### Can I insert a chart directly from my PHP code rather than shortcode?

Yes. Use the following PHP code:

```
<?php amcharts_insert( $chart_id ); ?>

```

Or, you can retrieve the chart object using following function:

```
<?php amcharts_get( $chart_id ); ?>

```

This will return an object with the following properties:

* title – a chart title
* post – a reference to original WP post object
* resources – a list of resource urls
* html – HTML code
* javascript – JavaScript code

### Can I pass custom parameters to chart code via shortcode?

Yes, starting from version 1.0.7.

Any parameter prefixed with “data-” will be passed into chart code via global AmCharts.wpChartData object.

I.e.:

```
[amcharts id="pie-1" data-file="data1.csv" data-sort="asc"]

```

The above shortcode will insert the following code **before** actual chart code:

```
AmCharts.wpChartData = {
  "file": "data1.csv",
  "sort": "asc"
}

```

You can then reference those passed variables in your chart code. I.e.:

```
alert( AmCharts.wpChartData.file );

```

### Are there any filters available?

Yes:

* amcharts\_shortcode\_data ( $data – parsed data passed in via data-\* parameters of the shortcode, $atts )
* amcharts\_shortcode\_resources ( $resources – text data from resources box, $atts )
* amcharts\_shortcode\_libs ( $libs – array of resouces, $atts )
* amcharts\_shortcode\_javascript ( $javascript – JavaScript portion of the chart, $atts )
* amcharts\_shortcode\_html ( $html – HTML portion of the chart, $atts )

### Is this plugin WPML-compatible?

Yup. It fully supports WPML. You can create language-specific versions of the charts and maps. The plugin will automatically select proper language when displaying it.

Yes, you need to work a little harder to get things going than with other plugins, but the output is so much better! I can’t imagine a diagram that can’t be done with Amworks. Keep up the great work 🙂

Have used Amcharts for my static sites. Briliiantly designed. Same concepts applied here for WordPress. However, since the charts are defined using JS and Amcharts object lib, there is a definite learning curve.

I used the free version of this at first, was able to create the chart and most importantly, use the dataloader to load some REST API web services I had created. They look and feel good, and the users really dig the charts!
