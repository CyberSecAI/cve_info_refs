Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `mlir::tfg::GraphDefImporter::ConvertNodeDef` function. This function is responsible for converting TensorFlow NodeDefs to MLIR operations.
- Specifically, the function didn't validate if the `node.op()` (the operation name of the node) was empty before attempting to use it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Null-dereference:** When a NodeDef with an empty `op` name is encountered, the code attempts to use `node.op()` without checking for emptiness, leading to a null-dereference, and a crash, instead of throwing an error.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacks proper input validation to ensure that required fields, such as the operation name, are present in the NodeDef.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious actor could craft a TensorFlow graph with NodeDefs that have empty operation names. When this graph is processed by the vulnerable `GraphDefImporter::ConvertNodeDef` function, it would result in a program crash. This can be exploited to cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Graph Defs:** An attacker needs to provide a malformed TensorFlow graph definition containing NodeDefs with missing operation names.
- **Import process:** The vulnerability is triggered during the process of importing or converting a GraphDef using the `mlir::tfg::GraphDefImporter`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply a custom TensorFlow GraphDef to a system that uses the vulnerable version of TensorFlow, specifically using the affected `mlir::tfg::GraphDefImporter`.
- No special privileges are needed, and the attack can be done on the application layer.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/ir/importexport/graphdef_import.cc` file.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure `node.op()` is not empty before accessing it.
- The fix commit is `a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5`
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.10.0, 2.9.2, 2.8.3, and 2.7.4

In summary, CVE-2022-36013 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in TensorFlow caused by a missing input validation in GraphDef importer function that leads to a crash due to null-dereference. The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious crafted GraphDef with an empty `op` name field.
