Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Kirby Panel's improper handling of HTML rendering within the `multiselect` field's dynamic options. Specifically, the Panel used HTML rendering for the raw option value instead of escaping it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code within the Panel's context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute malicious JavaScript code within the browser of a victim who is using the Kirby Panel.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** With the ability to execute JavaScript, attackers with Panel access can potentially escalate their privileges, especially if they target an admin user's session.
*  **Data theft**: Attackers might be able to steal sensitive information
*   **Other JavaScript-Powered Attacks:** The injected JavaScript could be used to perform a variety of other attacks, depending on the specific functionality of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Options Source:** An attacker needs to influence the data source for the multiselect options. This could be achieved by:
    *   Modifying content of sibling pages
    *   Compromising API endpoints that provide options
*   **Panel Access:** In some scenarios, attackers may need Panel access or they may trick users to enter malicious data in frontend forms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Influence Over Options Source:** The attacker must have some means of controlling the source of options used in the `multiselect` field.
*   **Low privileges in the system:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a low privilege user.
*   **No user interaction required:** The exploitation does not require user interaction.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to target the system.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is specific to the multiselect field.
* The issue was fixed in Kirby version 3.5.8.1 by replacing `v-html` with `v-text`
* The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9, marked as "moderate".
