## ðŸš¨ Security release

### [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from content entered in the tags and multiselect fields](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-rv3r-vqjj-8c76)

**Severity:** high (CVSS score 7.1)

The tags and multiselect fields allow to select tags from an autocompleted list. The tags field also allows to enter new tags or edit existing tags. Kirby already handled escaping of the autocompleted tags, but unfortunately the Panel used HTML rendering for new or edited tags as well as for custom tags from the content file.

This allowed **attackers with Panel access** to store malicious HTML code in a tag. The browser of the victim who visited the modified page in the Panel will then have rendered this malicious HTML code.

It also allowed **self-inflicted XSS attacks** in the tags field (meaning that malicious code is executed in the browser of the user who entered it). This could be used in social engineering attacks where a victim is convinced by an attacker to enter malicious code into a tags field.

**Visitors without Panel access** could *only* use this attack vector if your site allows changing the content of a tags or multiselect field from a frontend form (for example user self-registration or the creation of pages from a contact or other frontend form). If you validate or sanitize the provided form data, you are already protected against such attacks by external visitors.

You are also *not* affected by these vulnerabilities if your site doesn't have untrustworthy users with Panel access or a way to modify field values from the frontend or if you don't use the tags or multiselect fields.

**Note:** The fixes for these vulnerabilities have the side effect that every value in the tags and multiselect fields is displayed with double escaping (e.g. the `&` character is displayed as `&amp;`) when dynamic options are enabled, while dynamic options themselves are displayed with triple escaping. We will fix the double/triple escaping issues with a refactoring of the options fields (tags, multiselect, checkboxes, radio, select and toggles) in Kirby 3.8.

### [Cross-site scripting (XSS) from dynamic options in the multiselect field](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-3f89-869f-5w76)

**Severity:** medium (CVSS score 5.9)

The multiselect field allows to select tags from an autocompleted list. Unfortunately, the Panel in Kirby 3.5 used HTML rendering for the raw option value.

This allowed **attackers with influence on the options source** (e.g. content of sibling pages or an API endpoint) to inject HTML code. If a page in the Panel that uses the manipulated multiselect options was visited by a victim and the victim opened the autocomplete dropdown, the victim's browser will then have rendered this malicious HTML code.

You are *not* affected by this vulnerability if you don't use the multiselect field or only use it with options that cannot be manipulated by attackers.

# Cross-site scripting (XSS) from dynamic options in the multiselect field

Moderate

GHSA-3f89-869f-5w76
Aug 24, 2022

## Package

composer

getkirby/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

<=3.5.8

## Patched versions

3.5.8.1

## Description

### Introduction

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that allows to execute any kind of JavaScript code inside the Panel session of the same or other users. In the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.

Such vulnerabilities are critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users. They can escalate their privileges if they get access to the Panel session of an admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible.

### Impact

The multiselect field allows to select tags from an autocompleted list. Unfortunately, the Panel in Kirby 3.5 used HTML rendering for the raw option value.

This allowed **attackers with influence on the options source** (e.g. content of sibling pages or an API endpoint) to inject HTML code. If a page in the Panel that uses the manipulated multiselect options was visited by a victim and the victim opened the autocomplete dropdown, the victim's browser will then have rendered this malicious HTML code.

You are *not* affected by this vulnerability if you don't use the multiselect field or only use it with options that cannot be manipulated by attackers.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [Kirby 3.5.8.1](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8.1). Please update to this or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases) to fix the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

We recommend to update to the patch release. If you cannot update immediately, you can work around the issue by disabling the multiselect field. This can be done by uncommenting this field from all your blueprints.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
