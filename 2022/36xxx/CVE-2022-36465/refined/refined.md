The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in TOTOLink A3700R router firmware version V9.1.2u.6134_B20201202.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `sprintf` function used to format user-supplied input (`pppoeUser`) into a string. The size of the format string is not limited, which leads to a stack buffer overflow when the input string is too long.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow due to unbounded string formatting.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution (RCE). An attacker can hijack program control flow, overwrite the return address, and gain a root shell.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi` endpoint.
- The `pppoeUser` parameter in the request is used as the source of the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable router.
- No authentication is required initially to trigger the vulnerability, however the content mentions the possibility of gaining a stable root shell without authorization after the initial exploitation.
