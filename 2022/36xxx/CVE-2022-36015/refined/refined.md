{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `RangeSize` function when calculating the size of a range, due to the use of `int64_t` to represent the size which can overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Integer Overflow: The code calculates the range size using a formula that can result in a value exceeding the maximum limit of `int64_t`, leading to an overflow."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "The overflow leads to a crash, as the calculated size is used to allocate a tensor. The program will terminate unexpectedly.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing start, limit, and delta values to the `RangeSize` function that would result in a calculated size larger than the maximum value of `int64_t`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control or influence the input parameters (start, limit, delta) to the `RangeSize` function."
