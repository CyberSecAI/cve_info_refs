Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-36221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the `command_web_app.cgi` script. This script passes user-supplied input directly to the `cat.sh` script, which, after checking if the target is a pipe, outputs the contents of the file specified in the user input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `command_web_app.cgi` script does not sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `cat.sh` script only checks if the file is a pipe, and does not validate the path, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read the contents of any file on the router's filesystem that the web server process has permissions to access.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability can be used to disclose sensitive information from configuration files or any other readable files on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `command_web_app.cgi` endpoint with a file path containing path traversal sequences.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessed through the web interface of the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user of the web interface. It's mentioned that full admin is not required, but a valid user account is needed.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device's web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The content specifically mentions that the usefulness of this vulnerability is dependent on the existence of pipes on the router that contain sensitive information and that it is accessible to authenticated users only.
- The content provides an example of the attack using the path traversal sequence `../../../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` in the web interface.
