Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a null-dereference in the `mlir::tfg::TFOp::nameAttr` function within TensorFlow's graph definition importer. Specifically, the function `GraphDefImporter::ArgNumType` doesn't handle null type list attributes correctly when importing a GraphDef, leading to a crash. The code was using `dyn_cast` which returns a null pointer when the cast fails, rather than `dyn_cast_or_null` which returns null but allows for a check before dereferencing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** The primary weakness is the possibility of dereferencing a null pointer when a type list attribute is null.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate that type list attributes are not null before attempting to use them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability will lead to a crash of the TensorFlow process. This results in a denial of service, preventing the program from executing correctly.
- **Unintended Program Termination:**  The vulnerability can unexpectedly terminate programs that use the affected code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious GraphDef Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious GraphDef file containing null type list attributes designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Input Manipulation:** Attackers can control the input, and provide a crafted graph definition that would result in the null attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input to TensorFlow:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted GraphDef to the vulnerable TensorFlow process. This could be via a user-supplied file, a network interface, etc.
- **Understanding of GraphDef Structure:** The attacker must understand the structure of GraphDef files and the use of type list attributes to construct the exploit.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Versions:** TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 are affected, specifically those in the 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9 release lines.
- **Patches:** The issue was patched in commit `3a754740d5414e362512ee981eefba41561a63a6` and `a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5`.
- **Fix:** The fix involves changing `dyn_cast` to `dyn_cast_or_null` in `GraphDefImporter::ArgNumType` to handle null type list attributes gracefully and preventing the null pointer dereference.
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as low severity due to the limited impact of a crash (as opposed to code execution).

**Summary of Patches:**
- **Commit `3a754740d5414e362512ee981eefba41561a63a6`:** This commit addresses the null dereference issue by changing `dyn_cast<ArrayAttr>` to `dyn_cast_or_null<ArrayAttr>` and similarly for `IntegerAttr` and `TypeAttr` within the `GraphDefImporter::ArgNumType` function. This change ensures that null attribute values are handled properly and not dereferenced.

- **Commit `a0f0b9a21c9270930457095092f558fbad4c03e5`**: This commit adds a check to ensure that NodeDefs have a valid op name before processing it in `GraphDefImporter::ConvertNodeDef`. This resolves an additional issue where an empty node `op` field would cause a crash

In essence, the vulnerability was a result of improper handling of potentially null type attributes during the import process. The fix ensures that such cases are handled safely, preventing a crash.
