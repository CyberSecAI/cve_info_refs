- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) due to lack of authorization checks. The application doesn't properly verify if the user is authorized to access the requested data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  -  IDOR vulnerability.
  -  Lack of authorization checks when accessing data via API calls.
  -  Lack of rate-limiting, enabling brute force attempts.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - Unauthorized access to personal data of other parents and children.
  - Full visibility into sensitive information processed by the application, potentially violating GDPR.
- **Attack vectors**:
  - Interception of API calls via a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite).
  - Manipulation of ID values within the API requests.
  - Brute-forcing of valid IDs due to lack of rate limiting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker must have an authenticated account to make API requests.
  - The attacker should be able to intercept network traffic (using a proxy) and modify the requests.
