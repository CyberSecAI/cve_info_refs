Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-36969

**Root Cause:** Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references within the `LoadImportedLibraries` method of AVEVA Edge.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The software improperly processes XML documents, allowing an attacker to include external entities. This means the XML parser can be tricked into accessing external resources by specifying a URI in the crafted document.
*   **Improper Input Validation:**  The software doesn't properly validate or sanitize XML input, allowing it to process malicious XML content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the XXE vulnerability to force the application to read and embed content from local files and possibly remote resources into the XML document being processed. This allows an attacker to extract sensitive data from the host system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability could potentially be used to cause a DoS by targeting an extremely large file, forcing the application to consume excessive resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker crafts a malicious XML document that contains an external entity reference.
*   **User Interaction:** The target user must open or process the malicious document. This indicates that the application has to be tricked into loading a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file for the target to open.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required. The victim must open a crafted malicious file or visit a malicious webpage.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the `LoadImportedLibraries` method.
*   AVEVA has released an update (HF 2020.2.00.40) to address this vulnerability along with other vulnerabilities
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Piotr Bazydlo (@chudypb) of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS score of 6.6.
