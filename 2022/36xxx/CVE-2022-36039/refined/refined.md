Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds write in the `dex.c` file of the Rizin project when parsing DEX (Dalvik Executable) files. Specifically, two separate out-of-bounds write issues were identified:

1.  **`dex.c:89:13`**: A heap out-of-bounds write of 1 byte occurs in the `dex_string_new` function. This happens when processing string data within the DEX file.
2.  **`dex.c:905:35`**: A heap out-of-bounds write of 1 byte occurs in the `dex_resolve_library` function. This happens when processing library paths within the DEX file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write on the heap. This occurs because the code attempts to write a byte outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker could craft a malicious DEX file that triggers the out-of-bounds write, potentially overwriting sensitive data on the heap and hijacking program control.
*   **Crash:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the Rizin application, as demonstrated by the provided AddressSanitizer output.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious DEX File:** The primary attack vector is through a crafted malicious DEX file. A user opening this file with a vulnerable version of Rizin would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting a Malicious DEX File:** An attacker needs the ability to craft a specially crafted DEX file which exploits the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious DEX file with the vulnerable Rizin software.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered through fuzzing.
*   The issue was fixed in commit `1524f85` and is present in Rizin versions <=0.4.0
*   The vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2022-36039 and GitHub Security Advisory ID GHSA-pr85-hv85-45pg.
*   The `dex.c` file is responsible for parsing DEX files.
