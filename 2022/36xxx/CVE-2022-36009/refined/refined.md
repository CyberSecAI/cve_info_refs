Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-36009:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect parsing of the `"events_default"` key within `m.room.power_levels` events in the `gomatrixserverlib` library. The library was not correctly parsing this field, resulting in a default power level of zero being applied, regardless of the configured value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Incorrect Parsing:** The primary weakness is the failure to correctly parse the `"events_default"` field in the `m.room.power_levels` event, leading to a default value being used instead.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** Due to the incorrect parsing, the effective power levels for events were not being accurately determined. This could lead to scenarios where events are incorrectly authorized (allowed when they should be rejected) or rejected (denied when they should be allowed) by Dendrite servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Incorrect Event Authorization:**  Events could be incorrectly authorized or rejected. Specifically, if an administrator set `"events_default"` to a value other than the default (0), the server could incorrectly allow or reject messages if the client is using an outdated version.
*   **Potential for Privilege Escalation/Bypass:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the advisory, incorrect power level handling can lead to privilege escalation scenarios or bypasses depending on the specific configuration within the room and the intended access control.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Manipulation of `m.room.power_levels` events:** An attacker who can manipulate or send a crafted `m.room.power_levels` event (either directly or through a malicious client) could potentially trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to send Matrix events:** An attacker would need to be able to send or manipulate Matrix events within a room. This could be an attacker who is a member of the room or an attacker who is able to compromise the server.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware that the server is using a vulnerable version and the impact of the incorrect parsing of `"events_default"`.

**Additional Information:**
*   The fix is present in `gomatrixserverlib` commit `723fd49`
*   The affected versions of `gomatrixserverlib` are <= `6a49c18`
*   Dendrite version <= 0.9.2 are affected, with a patch in 0.9.3

This is a moderate severity issue as it may cause incorrect authorization, but only if the power levels are configured to values other than the defaults.
