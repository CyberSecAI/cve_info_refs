Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the `createProduct.php` file of the Garage Management System. The application does not properly validate the type of file being uploaded, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation, specifically within the "Product Image" section when adding a product.
- **Lack of File Type Validation:** The system does not properly check the file type, allowing the upload of a PHP file, which can then be executed on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the application and server, including data theft, data manipulation, and denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web interface:** The attacker can use the web interface of the application to upload the malicious file.
- The specific vulnerable functionality is located in `add-product.php`, under `Add Product` -> `Product Image`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs access to the web interface of the Garage Management System.
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality. Specifically, the content states the attacker needs to log in as 'mayuri.infospace@gmail.com/rootadmin'.
