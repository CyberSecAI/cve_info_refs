- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly concatenates user-provided IP addresses into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Blind SQL Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain complete control of the database server, depending on the database privileges and the nature of the data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker sends a crafted IP address via the `x-forwarded-for` header which gets incorporated in the SQL query.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the application and to manipulate HTTP headers such as `x-forwarded-for`.
