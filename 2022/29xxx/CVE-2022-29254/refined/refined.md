{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a lack of sufficient validation during the payment completion process in the Silverstripe Omnipay library. Specifically, for gateways that use intermediary states (like `isNotification()` or `isRedirect()`), it's possible to prematurely mark payments as complete without actual payment processing if the payment identifier or success URL is exposed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of payment completion",
      "Exposure of payment identifier or success URL in some cases"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to mark payments as completed without actually paying, leading to financial losses for the affected application or business.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
      "Exploiting intermediary payment gateway states"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept or obtain the payment identifier or success URL. This may be possible through flawed 3DSecure implementations, or by other means of network interception.",
	"additional_details": "The vulnerability is mitigated by most payment gateways hiding the payment identifier/success URL from users but some issuing banks may expose this data through flawed 3DSecure implementations. Patches were released for versions 2.5.2, 3.0.2, 3.1.4, and 3.2.1 of the `silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay` composer package."
