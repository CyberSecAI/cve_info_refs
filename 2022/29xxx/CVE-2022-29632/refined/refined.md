```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The file upload functionality in the `uploadpic` method of `apiuploadcontroller` does not authenticate users and allows users to define the file suffix.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated file upload",
    "Lack of file extension validation",
    "Arbitrary file upload"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious HTML files containing JavaScript, which can potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a POST request to `/course/api/upload/pic` with a crafted multipart/form-data request containing a malicious file. The attacker can set the filename and content-type of the uploaded file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No prior authentication is needed."
