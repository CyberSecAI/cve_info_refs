{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A segmentation fault occurs in the `strlen-avx2.S` component of the Bento4 library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code has a vulnerability that leads to a segmentation fault, possibly due to an issue in memory access or pointer handling during string length calculation.",
      "The specific vulnerability is related to how the `strlen-avx2.S` function handles input, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds memory access or dereferencing an invalid pointer."
    ],
    "impact": "A segmentation fault results in the program crashing, leading to denial of service (DoS). This could disrupt operations or prevent the intended use of the application using the Bento4 library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when the `mp42hls` tool is executed with a crafted input file (`poc`).",
      "The input file is passed to the `strlen` function and causes it to crash due to an invalid memory access."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to provide a crafted input file to `mp42hls`.",
      "The attacker needs to execute `mp42hls` tool using a specific command line option `--encryption-iv-mode fps` along with the crafted input file."
