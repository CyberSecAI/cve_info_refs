{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the 'id' parameter within the /cms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_client endpoint.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL injection vulnerability",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to information disclosure (database schema, sensitive data such as usernames, passwords), data modification, or denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the /cms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_client endpoint, injecting malicious SQL code into the 'id' parameter.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication details are specified in the provided exploit, therefore it could be unauthenticated access."
