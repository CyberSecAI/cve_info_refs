Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29598:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `fileName` parameter of the `/RRSWeb/maint/ShowDocument/ShowDocument.aspx` endpoint within the RRS v500 application. Although some basic filtering was implemented, it was insufficient to prevent the injection of malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application reflects user-supplied input from the `fileName` parameter directly into a JavaScript context within the server's response. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application attempts to sanitize input by encoding some special characters (e.g., greater/less than symbols), but it fails to prevent JavaScript code injection in the context of a JavaScript directive

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Masquerading as a victim user:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that could be used to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Disclosure of sensitive data:**  The injected scripts could be designed to steal session cookies, access local storage or other sensitive data from the user's browser.
- **Performing actions that the victim user is allowed to perform:** The attacker could manipulate the user's session to conduct activities within the application on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **GET request manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the vulnerable endpoint and the malicious JavaScript payload within the `fileName` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker could send a user a link via email, social media or other channels which when clicked, will execute the XSS payload in the victim's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing the malicious JavaScript payload in the `fileName` parameter.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to entice a victim user to click a link or otherwise make a request to the vulnerable URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable parameter `fileName` is used when the `requestType` parameter is set to `ExternalLink`.
- The XSS payload is reflected within a `window.location.href` JavaScript context, allowing for successful execution of the injected code.
- The provided content includes a specific XSS payload that leverages the `createElement` and `appendChild` functions to load an external JavaScript file.
- The content provides screenshots demonstrating the server's response to the XSS payload and the rendered output in the browser.
