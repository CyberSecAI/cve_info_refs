- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of the `file_path` variable in the `SaveImportFile` function within the `KnowledgebasePageActions.cs` file, which allows for directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application doesn't properly validate the file path provided in the CSV file, allowing an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files located on the server by providing a manipulated file path within the attachments field of the uploaded CSV file.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `/Knowledgebase/KnowledgebasePageActions.aspx?action=importarticles` with a multipart/form-data containing a malicious CSV file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable Lansweeper application.  The attacker must be authenticated (or have a valid `__RequestVerificationToken`) to reach the vulnerable code path.
