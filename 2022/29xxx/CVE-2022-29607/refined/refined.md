    "summary": "The provided content discusses the INTENDER fuzzing framework, which discovered 12 bugs in ONOS, 11 of which were assigned CVEs, including CVE-2022-29607.  It also provides a detailed explanation of Intent Based Networking (IBN) and the challenges in securing it.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of CVE-2022-29607 is related to a logic error in how ONOS handles intent modifications, specifically when a HostToHost intent is modified to have the same source and destination. It results in the intent being marked as INSTALLED without installing any corresponding flow rules.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mishandling of intent-state transitions",
	"Absence of intent-flow mapping"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can disrupt network connectivity by creating intents that appear to be installed but lack the necessary flow rules, thus affecting network traffic.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Control plane access via an application or REST client"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to interact with the IBN controller's API to submit, modify, and withdraw intents."
