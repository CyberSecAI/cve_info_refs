- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not sanitize user-provided URL parameters before displaying them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `url` parameter is not sanitized, which allows injecting malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which can lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other client-side attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `url` parameter, an attacker can inject JavaScript into the page. The `url` parameter needs to be base64 encoded and URL encoded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious URL to a user who is logged into the application, or trick the user into visiting the URL.
