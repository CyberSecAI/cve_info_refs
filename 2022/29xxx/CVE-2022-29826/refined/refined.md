Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the *Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312)* within the Mitsubishi Electric FA engineering software. Specifically, sensitive data is stored in a way that it is not encrypted or protected from unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information (CWE-312):** Sensitive information is stored without encryption, making it accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the software.
- **Access to Programs and Project Files:** This can lead to the viewing or execution of programs or project files.
- **Unauthorized access:** The attacker might be able to gain access to the CPU module and the OPC UA server module.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network, with the complexity of the attack being high.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated, remote attacker:**  An attacker does not need to be authenticated, and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **High attack complexity:** The vulnerability has a high attack complexity.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- GX Works3:
  + 1.000A to 1.011M
  + 1.015R to 1.087R
- Motion Control Setting (GX Works3 related software):
  + 1.000A to 1.033K
  + 1.035M to 1.042U
    
**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specifically related to the handling of sensitive information.
- The exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to and manipulation of the system.

**Mitigations:**
- Update the software to the latest version.
   -  For GX Works3, download fixed Ver. 1.090U or later.
   - For Motion Control Setting, download fixed Ver 1.045X or later, and apply the mitigations for CVE-2022-29826 for GX Works3.
- Ensure that malicious attackers cannot access project files or security keys that are stored in your computer/server and configuration files that are stored in your personal computer running the software via untrusted network or host
- Install antivirus software in your personal computer running the software.
- Encrypt project files and security keys when sending or receiving them over the Internet.
