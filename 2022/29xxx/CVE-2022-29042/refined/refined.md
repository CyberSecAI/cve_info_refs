Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2022-29042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Job Generator Plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to sanitize user-provided input when displaying parameter names and descriptions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the parameter name or description. When a user views the affected pages (such as "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages), the malicious script will execute in their browser, potentially leading to:
*   Session hijacking
*   Data theft
*   Malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector is through the Job Generator Plugin when defining or configuring job parameters. An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject the malicious code through parameter names or descriptions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs "Item/Configure" permission, which allows them to modify job configurations.
* The attacker needs to create or edit a job configuration and insert the malicious script into a parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is not exploitable on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages in Jenkins core versions 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 and later because of the fix for [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601]
*  The content states that no fix is currently available for this vulnerability in the Job Generator Plugin.
