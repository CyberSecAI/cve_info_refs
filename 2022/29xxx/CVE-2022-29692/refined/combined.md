| Unicorn Python package supports up to version 1.0.3  ``` [Latest version](https://pypi.org/project/unicorn/) Released: May 27, 2021 unicorn 1.0.3  ```  I also tried to use `libunicorn.so.2` generated by compiling unicorn dev branch replace `libunicorn.so`(1.0.3) installed by PIP command. But unicorn 2 doesn't seem to work well in the latest version of the unicorn python API.  I also modified the `unicorn.py` to try to bypass `unicorn.py` detection of the unicorn version, but there will still be compatibility problems.  ``` # unicorn.py # verify version compatibility with the core before doing anything (major, minor, _combined) = uc_version() ''' if major != uc.UC_API_MAJOR or minor != uc.UC_API_MINOR:     self._uch = None     # our binding version is different from the core's API version     raise UcError(uc.UC_ERR_VERSION) ''' ``` |

| I may know the cause of the problem.  `0x00000000013fdd38` -> `uc->hooks_to_del->head` .  When we use `uc_emu_start` for the second time, unicorn is already in an abnormal state (`Invalid memory read (UC_ERR_READ_UNMAPPED)`), so it will continue run to the following code  ``` // uc.c  uc_emu_start if (uc->vm_start(uc)) {     return UC_ERR_RESOURCE; }  // emulation is done uc->emulation_done = true;  // remove hooks to delete clear_deleted_hooks(uc); ```  remove hooks to delete!  However, our PoC is still in the first `uc_emu_start->vm_start` environment, and QEMU TCG is still trying to execute hook code. In fact, the hook code has been released. |

| Just FYI, this issue no longer seems to affect the 2.0.1 version.  I tried to run the proof of concept code posted in the description, and apparently it does not produce a crash with the 2.0.1 version of unicorn.  ``` $ venv/bin/python3 -m pip install unicorn==1.0.3 Collecting unicorn==1.0.3   Using cached unicorn-1.0.3-py2.py3-none-manylinux1_x86_64.whl (8.1 MB) Installing collected packages: unicorn Successfully installed unicorn-1.0.3  $ ./poc.py 0x4004e0:    adc    byte ptr [rax], dh >>> Tracing instruction at 0x0, instruction size = 0x1 160351 Segmentation fault (core dumped)  $ venv/bin/python3 -m pip install -U unicorn Requirement already satisfied: unicorn in ./venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages (1.0.3) Collecting unicorn   Downloading unicorn-2.0.1.post1-py2.py3-none-manylinux1_x86_64.manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (16.1 MB)      ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 16.1/16.1 MB 9.9 MB/s eta 0:00:00 Installing collected packages: unicorn   Attempting uninstall: unicorn     Found existing installation: unicorn 1.0.3     Uninstalling unicorn-1.0.3:       Successfully uninstalled unicorn-1.0.3 Successfully installed unicorn-2.0.1.post1  $ ./poc.py 0x4004e0:    adc    byte ptr [rax], dh >>> Tracing instruction at 0x0, instruction size = 0x1 160366 Invalid memory read (UC_ERR_READ_UNMAPPED)  ```  The 2nd invocation of the Python code using the 2.0.1 version of the package just displays an error message as expected without crashing. |
