# HTML injection with additional signup fields

Moderate

[evansims](/evansims)
published
GHSA-7ww6-75fj-jcj7
May 5, 2022

## Package

npm

auth0-lock
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 11.33.0

## Patched versions

11.33.0

## Description

### Overview

In versions before and including `11.32.2`, when the “additional signup fields” feature [is configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields), a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata` payload (using the `name` property).

Verification emails, when applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email template.

### Am I affected?

You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using `auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the “additional signup fields” feature in your application.

### How to fix that?

Upgrade to version `11.33.0`.

### Will this update impact my users?

Additional signup fields that have been added to the signup tab on Lock will have HTML tags stripped from user input from version `11.33.0` onwards. The user will not receive any validation warning or feedback, but backend data will no longer include HTML.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-29172

### Weaknesses

[CWE-79](/advisories?query=cwe%3A79)
