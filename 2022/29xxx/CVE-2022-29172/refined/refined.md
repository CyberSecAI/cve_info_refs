Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29172

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the "additional signup fields" feature of the `auth0-lock` library. Specifically, HTML tags within these fields were not being stripped or escaped before being stored in the `user_metadata` payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTML Injection:** Malicious actors could inject arbitrary HTML code into the additional signup fields.
- **Stored XSS:** The injected HTML was stored in the `user_metadata` payload, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Links:**  When verification emails were generated using the `user_metadata`, the injected HTML could be rendered as part of the recipient's name, allowing attackers to craft malicious links within the email.
- **Potentially broader XSS:** Although the specific impact described is related to email generation, the fact that the user-provided data is not sanitized also makes it likely that other areas of the application are also vulnerable to XSS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to use the "additional signup fields" during user registration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to register a new user and input data into the "additional signup fields" of the application using the vulnerable `auth0-lock` library.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in `auth0-lock` versions `<= 11.32.2`.
- The fix implemented in version `11.33.0` involved sanitizing the input by stripping HTML tags using DOMPurify.
- The fix does not provide user feedback or validation warning but removes all HTML from the stored data.
- This vulnerability is classified as a moderate severity issue.
- The CWE is CWE-79, which relates to improper neutralization of input during web page generation (cross-site scripting).
