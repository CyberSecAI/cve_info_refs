## Description

### **Boost Conversions with Herd Effects – Social Proof Notifications for WordPress**

**Herd Effects** is a flexible notification plugin that allows you to create custom popups to display simulated or user-defined activities on your website. While the plugin offers the **appearance of social proof**, it does not automatically pull real-time data from your site. Instead, users can create notifications by defining their own variables, such as recent purchases or signups, to simulate activity and drive engagement.

Display **pop-up notifications** for sales, signups, or other actions using customizable templates that capture attention and motivate visitors to act.

### = Key Features of Herd Effects =

* **Customizable Popup Templates**: Easily create your own notifications using templates with variables like names, locations, or numbers.
* **Simulated Activity**: Users manually define the data (e.g., recent purchases or signups) to create the appearance of social proof.
* **Notification Timing Control**: Set intervals for notifications to ensure consistent visibility.
* **2,000+ FontAwesome Icons**: Choose from over 2,000 icons or upload custom ones to personalize notifications.
* **Custom Notification Titles**: Personalize titles to match specific actions or events on your site.
* **Shortcode Support**: Display notifications anywhere on your site using shortcodes.
* **Advanced Display Settings**: Control visibility based on user activity, screen size, or specific devices.
* **GDPR Compliant**: Cookie-free operation to ensure compliance with privacy laws.

—

**Unlock even more features with the [Pro version](https://wow-estore.com/item/wow-herd-effects-pro/) to maximize engagement with advanced notifications.**

[Upgrade to Pro](https://wow-estore.com/item/wow-herd-effects-pro/) | [Demo Pro](https://demo.wow-estore.com/wow-herd-effects-pro/)

—

### = Use Cases =

**Herd Effects** can be used for various notifications that simulate activity on your WordPress site, including:

* **Recent Purchases**: Create notifications for recent sales to build trust and encourage further purchases.
* **Registration Alerts**: Display notifications for new user signups to create a sense of activity.
* **Service Orders**: Simulate service bookings to create urgency.
* **Event Signups**: Encourage event participation by displaying simulated or user-defined event registrations.
* **App Installations**: Show custom notifications for app downloads or installations to boost credibility.
* **Real-Time Activity Simulation**: Showcase predefined actions like, “John from NYC just signed up,” to mimic live activity.

**Note:** The notifications do not reflect actual real-time user actions unless you input the data manually.

—

### = Integration with Other FREE Plugins =

**Maximize your notifications** by integrating Herd Effects with these plugins:

* **[Counter Box](https://wordpress.org/plugins/counter-box/)**: Add countdowns and timers to complement your notifications.
* **[Buttons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buttons/)**: Create call-to-action buttons within your custom notifications.
* **[Calculator Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/calculator-builder/)**: Add calculators for interactive elements alongside your notifications.
* **[Floating Button](https://wordpress.org/plugins/floating-button/)**: Add sticky floating buttons to drive further engagement.
* **[Modal Window](https://wordpress.org/plugins/modal-window/)**: Create in-depth announcements with modal windows alongside your popups

2. **Option 2**: Download the plugin as a .zip file, then upload it via `Plugins` -> `Add New` -> `Upload Plugin`, or unzip and upload it via FTP to `/wp-content/plugins/`.

After installation:

1. Press **Activate** in the Plugins list.
2. Navigate to **Herd Effects** in the WordPress admin menu to start creating your first set of notifications.

[wpwench](https://profiles.wordpress.org/wpwench/ "Posts by wpwench")

Didn’t work properly for me using the shortcode on one of my templates and it wasn’t worth trying to fix it because the plugin is very restricted in the free version. Can’t style it at all so you’re left with a plain black look which is nothing but a distraction that looks very fake. Scarily I was putting it on my checkout page and recon this would have scared visitors off rather than pushed them towards the sale.

Why take the time and trouble to lie to those visiting your website when you could use a plugin to help? Herd Effects capitalizes on the emotional and brings out the worst in humanity to increase traffic to your website.

I installed and configured the plugin and it unconfigured all the banners on my homepage both on the desktop and on the mobile. Beautiful crap.

# Risks

CVSS 6.8

##### 6.8

### Local File Inclusion

This could allow a malicious actor to include local files of the target website and show its output onto the screen. Files which store credentials, such as database credentials, could potentially allow complete database takeover depending on the configuration.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

This security issue has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.

![Update to version X or later](https://patchstack.com/database/img/update-checkmark.svg)
### Update to version 5.2.1 or later.

Update to version 5.2.1 or later to remove the vulnerability.
Patchstack users can turn on auto-update for vulnerable plugins only.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
