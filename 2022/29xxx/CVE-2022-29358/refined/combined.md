| Hi, there is a integer overflow bug in \_parse\_special\_tag function, sxmlc.c.   [epub2txt2/src/sxmlc.c](https://github.com/kevinboone/epub2txt2/blob/02f69e6243d6c96f78da45fb710a265e5aee2fb5/src/sxmlc.c#L1203-L1219)  Lines 1203 to 1219 in [02f69e6](/kevinboone/epub2txt2/commit/02f69e6243d6c96f78da45fb710a265e5aee2fb5)   |  | static TagType \_parse\_special\_tag(const SXML\_CHAR\* str, int len, \_TAG\* tag, XMLNode\* node) | | --- | --- | |  | { | |  | if (sx\_strncmp(str, tag->start, tag->len\_start)) | |  | return TAG\_NONE; | |  |  | |  | if (sx\_strncmp(str + len - tag->len\_end, tag->end, tag->len\_end)) /\* There probably is a '>' inside the tag \*/ | |  | return TAG\_PARTIAL; | |  |  | |  | node->tag = \_\_malloc((len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end + 1)\*sizeof(SXML\_CHAR)); | |  | if (node->tag == NULL) | |  | return TAG\_ERROR; | |  | sx\_strncpy(node->tag, str + tag->len\_start, len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end); | |  | node->tag[len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end] = NULC; | |  | node->tag\_type = tag->tag\_type; | |  |  | |  | return node->tag\_type; | |  | } |     It passes ((len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end + 1)\*sizeof(SXML\_CHAR)) as a parameter to malloc function. If (len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end) == -1, then (len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end + 1) == 0. It is legal to use 0 as an argument to the malloc function, and it will return the address of a small heap successfully.   However, in line 1214, it passes (len - tag->len\_start - tag->len\_end) as a parameter to strncpy function. -1 will be coerced to an unsigned integer: 0xffffffffffffffff. It is a huge size and will make the program crashed.  poc: [poc.zip](https://github.com/kevinboone/epub2txt2/files/8482640/poc.zip)  To reproduce:  ``` $ wget https://github.com/kevinboone/epub2txt2/files/8482640/poc.zip ...... $ unzip poc.zip Archive:  poc.zip   inflating: poc $ ls epub2txt  poc  poc.zip $ ./epub2txt --version epub2txt version 2.04 Copyright (c)2013-2022 Kevin Boone and contributors Distributed under the terms of the GNU Public Licence, v3.0 $ ./epub2txt poc /tmp/epub2txt5552/OPS/epb.opf  bad CRC cb87c959  (should be 0192f2f4) Segmentation fault (core dumped)  ```  The epub2txt is built with:  ``` git clone https://github.com/kevinboone/epub2txt2 && cd epub2txt2 make && sudo make install  ```  Tested on: Ubuntu 20.04 |

| I'm not sure what to do about this. The failure occurs because epub2txt is fed with gibberish XML. So it crashes. It crashes in a clean and safe way because there's an immediate segfault. Sure, it would be nicer for the user to get a more helpful error message, but I suspect there's a gazillion ways you could formulate a broken EPUB that would crash the utility. The EPUB supplied here crashes the Calibre EPUB viewer as well, although you get a Python stack back-trace rather than segfault. But it still fails.  I use a lightweight XML parser to keep the size of epub2txt to a minimum, so it can run on embedded systems. Probably I'd get a nicer mode of failure if I used a full-fat XML parser. But -- and this is the main point I'm trying to make -- *it will still fail*.  So I'm unsure what merit there is to fixing this bug. I'm not denying it's a bug, but fixing it won't really make epub2txt a better utility. It still won't be able to process a corrupt EPUB. If epub2txt crashes with any well-formed EPUB, that can be displayed using other viewers, that's something I'd want to fix. This kind of thing, though, I'm not sure.  Comments welcome. |

Yes, I agree with you that if epub2txt2 is used in embedded systems, it is not very important to fix this bug. |
