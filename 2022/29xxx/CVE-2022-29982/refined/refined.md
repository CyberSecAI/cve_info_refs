Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `manage_service.php` file of the Simple-Client-Management-System. The application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application directly uses the `id` parameter from the URL in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database.
- Potential for further compromise: Depending on the database user's privileges and application functionality, an attacker might be able to modify, add, or delete data, or even execute operating system commands via database functions.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in the URL of a GET request to `/cms/admin/maintenance/manage_service.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which is accessible either locally or remotely if the system is exposed on the network.
- No authentication is explicitly required to trigger the vulnerability (though the page is under /cms/admin, so authentication may be required).

**Additional Details:**
The provided content demonstrates a blind SQL injection. The attacker uses the `length(database())` SQL function to determine the length of the database name by observing the difference in the Content-Length of the response. The database name was discovered to be 6 characters long.
