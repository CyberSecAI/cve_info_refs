## Commit

[Permalink](/nginx/njs/commit/222d6fdcf0c6485ec8e175f3a7b70d650c234b4e)

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed njs\_vmcode\_interpreter() when "toString" conversion fails.

```
Previously, while interpreting a user function, njs_vmcode_interpreter()
might return prematurely when an error happens.  This is not correct
because the current frame has to be unwound (or exception caught)
first.

The fix is exit through only 5 appropriate exit points to ensure
proper unwinding.

This closes [#467](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/467) issue on Github.
