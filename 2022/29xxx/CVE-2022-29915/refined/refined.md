Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29915:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Performance API handled cross-origin redirects. Specifically, the `fetchStart` and `startTime` properties of `PerformanceResourceTiming` objects were not properly set when a cross-origin resource had redirects, and the Timing-Allow-Origin (TAO) check failed. This allowed an attacker to determine if a cross-origin URL was a redirect by calculating the difference between these two properties.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The Performance API leaked information about whether a cross-origin resource had redirects, which is considered private.
- **Inconsistent Timing:** The `fetchStart` and `startTime` properties were not consistently set when TAO checks failed, leading to the leakage of information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privacy Violation:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to probe the browsing history of a user by tracking whether a specific resource has redirected. This allows the attacker to make inferences about the user's behavior and potentially identify visited websites and resources.
- **Fingerprinting:** Although the severity is marked as low, this can be combined with other vulnerabilities to create a fingerprinting method.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web-based Attack:** A malicious website could exploit this vulnerability by loading cross-origin resources and using JavaScript to query the Performance API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to host a website that can load arbitrary resources.
- The attacker needs to execute JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- The attacker needs no special position or privilege and just needs the user to visit the attacker controlled page.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that when a TAO check fails for a cross-origin resource, the `fetchStart` property is set to the same value as the `startTime` property. This prevents the attacker from being able to detect redirects using these properties.

The vulnerability was reported by Sohom Datta.
The fix was implemented by Sean Feng [:sefeng].
The fix was included in Firefox 100.

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue is similar to a vulnerability reported in Chromium (see the link provided in the bug report), which was also fixed.
- The bug report includes an example `index.html` file that demonstrates the vulnerability (see attached file).
- A patch was created to address the vulnerability by making `fetchStart` uses `StarTime` when a TAO check fails for `PerformanceResourceTiming`.
