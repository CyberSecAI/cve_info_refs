    "summary": "The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2022-29904) in the SemanticDrilldown MediaWiki extension. The vulnerability is located in the Special:BrowseData page, where the GET parameter `_cat` is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `_cat` GET parameter in the `Special:BrowseData` page before being used in a SQL query within the SemanticDrilldown extension.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL injection vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `_cat` parameter, potentially bypassing intended query logic, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or other harmful actions. In this case, the provided example shows the attacker bypassing the WHERE clause, which results in more data being displayed than requested.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By manipulating the `_cat` GET parameter in the `Special:BrowseData` page URL."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft and send a URL with a malicious `_cat` parameter. They also need to be aware of existing categories on the target wiki because the attack uses a category title to craft the malicious SQLi, which is then used in the SQL query. The attacker does not need any special permissions or user-level access, although it is limited to editors as they are capable of creating new categories.  However, the vulnerability is publicly accessible.",
        "additional_notes": "The provided information is more detailed than a standard CVE description, as it includes specific code locations, the vulnerable parameter, and the method of exploitation along with limitations."
