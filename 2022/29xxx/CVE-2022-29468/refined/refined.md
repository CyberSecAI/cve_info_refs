  "CVE-2022-29468": {
    "description": "A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in WWBN AVideo 11.6 and dev master commit 3f7c0364. A specially-crafted HTTP request can lead to increased privileges. An attacker can get an authenticated user to send a crafted HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The AVideo application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trick an administrator into performing actions like password change, leading to account compromise and privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker crafts a malicious webpage containing a form that sends an HTTP request to the vulnerable application.",
      "The attacker then tricks an authenticated user (e.g., an administrator) into visiting the malicious page."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage, and the victim needs to be an authenticated user of the AVideo application. No network access to the application is required beyond normal user access.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was demonstrated using the password change functionality. An attacker can create a malicious page that automatically submits a form to change the user's password, without the user's knowledge, if the user is logged in into AVideo website as admin."
