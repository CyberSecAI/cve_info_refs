# Client Certificates are accepted without CertificateVerify

Moderate

[Sean-Der](/Sean-Der)
published
GHSA-w45j-f832-hxvh
May 16, 2022

## Package

gomod

Pion DTLS
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v2.1.4

## Patched versions

v2.1.5

## Description

### Impact

A DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that it doesn't posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject it.

This issue affects users that are using Client certificates only. The connection itself is still secure. The Certificate provided by clients can't be trusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to v2.1.5

### Patches

Upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.5

### Workarounds

No workarounds available, upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.5

### References

Thank you to [Juho Nurminen](https://github.com/jupenur) and the Mattermost team for discovering and reporting this.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N

### CVE ID
