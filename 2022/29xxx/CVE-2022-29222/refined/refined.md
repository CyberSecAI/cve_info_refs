The provided content relates to CVE-2022-29222.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The DTLS server in versions prior to 2.1.5 did not properly verify client certificates. Specifically, it would accept a client certificate without requiring a corresponding `CertificateVerify` message, which proves that the client possesses the private key associated with the certificate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The server does not enforce the requirement of a `CertificateVerify` message after a client sends a certificate.
- This allows a client to present a certificate without proving ownership of the corresponding private key.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious client can present any certificate without possessing the private key, thus impersonating a legitimate client.
- The server will accept the connection, thinking the client is authenticated when in fact, it's not.
- This can lead to a loss of integrity, since the server cannot be sure of the identity of the client.
- The provided certificate cannot be trusted, leading to potential security issues in applications that rely on verified client certificates for authentication and authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network. An attacker can connect to the vulnerable server over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a DTLS connection with the vulnerable server.
- The attacker needs to have a valid certificate, but it does not need to possess the corresponding private key.
