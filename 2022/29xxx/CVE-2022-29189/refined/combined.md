Before we imposed no limit on the amount of data we would buffer during
the handshake. This changes adds a 2 megabyte. When the limit is
exceeded the Conn returns an error.

# Buffer for inbound DTLS fragments has no limit

Moderate

[Sean-Der](/Sean-Der)
published
GHSA-cx94-mrg9-rq4j
May 10, 2022

## Package

gomod

Pion DTLS
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<= v2.1.3

## Patched versions

2.1.4

## Description

### Impact

A buffer that was used for inbound network traffic had no upper limit. Pion DTLS would buffer all network traffic from the remote user until the handshake completes or times out. An attacker could exploit this to cause excessive memory usage.

### Patches

Upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.4

### Workarounds

No workarounds available, upgrade to Pion DTLS v2.1.4

### References

Thank you to [Juho Nurminen](https://github.com/jupenur) and the Mattermost team for discovering and reporting this.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [Pion DTLS](https://github.com/pion/dtls)
* Email us at team@pion.ly

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L

### CVE ID
