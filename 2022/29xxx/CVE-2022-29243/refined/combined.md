# Improper input-size validation on the user new session name

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-7cwm-qph5-4h5w
May 30, 2022

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 22.2.7, < 23.0.4

## Patched versions

22.2.7, 23.0.4

## Description

### Impact

Missing input-size validation of new session names allows users to create app passwords with long names which are then loaded into memory on usage, resulting in impacted performance.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.7 or 23.0.4

### Workarounds

No workaround available

### References

* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/31658)
* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1153138)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
