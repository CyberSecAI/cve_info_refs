Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29039:

**CVE-2022-29039:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Gerrit Trigger plugin does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts into the parameter name and description which will be executed when the parameter is displayed on pages like "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters." This can lead to arbitrary script execution in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission within Jenkins. They would inject malicious code into the parameter name or description of the vulnerable parameter type.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to have 'Item/Configure' permission.
    * The attacker needs to be able to list the parameter on pages like 'Build With Parameters' or 'Parameters'.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a group of similar XSS vulnerabilities affecting multiple Jenkins plugins that provide additional parameter types.
*   The issue is that the plugins do not escape the parameter name and description before displaying them, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript.
*   Jenkins core has implemented mitigations for this type of vulnerability on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since version 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix.
*   The Gerrit Trigger Plugin version affected is 2.35.2 and earlier. The fix is provided in version 2.35.3.
