{
  "CVE-2022-29948": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure hardware design allows bypassing password-based authentication.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Violation of Secure Design Principles (CWE-657)",
      "The unknown microcontroller that handles passcode authentication can be swapped between devices to bypass security controls."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the stored encrypted data on a targeted Lepin EP-KP001 USB flash drive.",
    "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the Lepin EP-KP001 USB flash drive is required. The attacker must be able to desolder and solder components.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a working Lepin EP-KP001 device to extract the microcontroller from, the ability to desolder and solder the microcontrollers of both devices, and physical access to the target device."
