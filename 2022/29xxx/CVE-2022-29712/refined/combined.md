It would probably also help to sanitize `service_ip, hostname, and service_param`

| github doesnt allow you to comment on lines too far outside a diff, but on line 135 this is wrong also, should be an array with arguments and pipe it thought [escapeshellarg()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php) |

| [@Jellyfrog](https://github.com/Jellyfrog) absolutely... unfortunately, service\_params is just a string stored in the database free-form entered by the admin. My thoughts is change it to accept both that and array based parameters (when running, not saving). But that also requires a ui change. |
