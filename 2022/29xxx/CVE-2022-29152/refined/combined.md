# CVE-2022-29152

## Description

The Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect login portal unsafely writes values from the 'AppPortal' cookie into the page source, permitting arbitrary Javascript execution.

## Impact

Portal credentials can be captured via cross-site scripting.

## Exploitability

To persist the login form fields, the Ericom portal sets the 'AppPortal' cookie and populates it with POST data from the last failed login attempt. Because of that behavior, a malicious cookie can be set from an attacker-controlled domain by using cross-site request forgery to submit a failed login request. If a victim views an attacker's webpage a single time, an attacker can trigger an exploit chain that may result in the theft of Active Directory credentials.

## CVE Reference

CVE-2022-29152

## Resolution

The vendor has not responded to responsible disclosure.

## Discovery Credits

Ryan Emmons - CBI

## Disclosure Timeline

* 2 April 2022 - A ticket was created with the vendor and an autoreply was received.
* 15 April 2022 - No follow-up from the vendor after two weeks, so the issue is being publicly disclosed.
