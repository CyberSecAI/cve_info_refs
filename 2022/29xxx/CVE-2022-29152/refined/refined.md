Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29152:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect login portal insecurely incorporates values from the 'AppPortal' cookie directly into the HTML source code of the page. This behavior allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. The portal fails to sanitize or properly encode user-controlled data (from the 'AppPortal' cookie) before embedding it into the HTML, leading to potential execution of malicious scripts.
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The 'AppPortal' cookie, intended to persist login form fields after a failed attempt, is exploited. An attacker can manipulate this cookie to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Theft:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to capture a victim's portal login credentials using XSS. Specifically, the vulnerability can lead to the theft of Active Directory credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker crafts a malicious login request that, when submitted via CSRF, sets the 'AppPortal' cookie with attacker-controlled JavaScript.
*   **Malicious Webpage:** The victim is lured into visiting a webpage controlled by the attacker. This page can submit the malicious login request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker-Controlled Domain:** The attacker needs to have control over a domain from which they can host the malicious webpage.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The victim must visit the attacker-controlled webpage at least once. This triggers the malicious login request, setting the exploit payload in the 'AppPortal' cookie.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect login portal.
*   The vendor has not responded to the vulnerability disclosure as of the provided timeline.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable using a combination of CSRF and XSS techniques
