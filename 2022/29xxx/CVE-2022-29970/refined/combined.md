Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3166-1              debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : ruby-sinatra
Version        : 2.0.5-4+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-29970
Debian Bug     : 1014717

A file traversal vulnerability was discovered in src:ruby-sinatra, a
popular web server often used with Ruby on Rails. We now validate that
any expanded paths match the allowed `public_dir` when serving static
files.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.0.5-4+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sinatra packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-sinatra please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-sinatra>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
