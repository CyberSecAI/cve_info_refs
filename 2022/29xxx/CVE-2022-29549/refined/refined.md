Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux, in versions prior to manifest version 2.5.548.2, executes programs at specified full pathnames without performing ownership and permission checks first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Privilege Checks:** The agent doesn't verify ownership and permissions before executing programs, allowing an attacker to potentially substitute malicious code.
*   **Local Write Access Exploitable:** The vulnerability relies on the attacker having local write access to pathnames used by the Qualys agent, which are typically controlled by non-root users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  A malicious actor with local write access to a vulnerable path can inject arbitrary code, and when the Qualys Cloud Agent executes a program from that path as root, the attacker's code also executes with root privileges.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Attackers who initially only have limited user access to the system can elevate their privileges to root, gaining full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to log into the system and have write permissions to specific directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** The attacker must have already gained a foothold on the target system.
*   **Write Permissions:** The attacker must be able to write to one of the directories used by the Qualys Cloud Agent.
*   **Qualys Agent running as Root:** The Qualys Cloud Agent must be running with root privileges for the exploitation to succeed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by the Unqork Security Team.
*   Qualys released updated agent manifests (version 2.5.548.2) to remediate this vulnerability, which were automatically deployed to all regions.
*   Qualys assessed the attack complexity as High because it requires prior local system access and the ability to write to user paths.

*   Qualys provided QID 376807 for customers to identify assets using older manifest versions.

*   New versions of the Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux were released with enhanced defense-in-depth mechanisms, allowing customers to choose different privilege profiles for VM scans (Agent User Mode, Safe Mode, Dynamically Privilege Elevation Mode).
