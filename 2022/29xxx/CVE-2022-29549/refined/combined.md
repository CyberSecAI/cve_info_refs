The security and protection of our customers is of the utmost importance to Qualys, as is transparency whenever issues arise. A customer responsibly disclosed two scenarios related to the Qualys Cloud Agent:

1. For the first scenario, we added supplementary safeguards for signatures running on Linux systems
2. For the second scenario, we dispute the finding; however we believe absolute transparency is key, and so we have listed the issue here

Please note below that the first scenario requires that a malicious actor is already present on the computer running the Qualys Cloud Agent, and that the agent is running with root privileges.

It is important to note that **there has been no indication of an incident or breach of confidentiality, integrity, or availability** of the:

* Qualys Platform (including the Qualys Cloud Agent and Scanners)
* Qualys Codebase
* Qualys Signature Set
* Qualys Customer Data

Qualys engineering and product teams have implemented additional safeguards, and there is **no action** required by Qualys customers at this time. In addition, we have updated our documentation to help guide customers in selecting the appropriate privilege and logging levels for the Qualys Cloud Agent.

The specific details of the issues addressed are below:

## Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux: Possible Local Privilege Escalation

| **Advisory ID:** Q-PSA-2022-01 | **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29549 |
| --- | --- |
| **Published:** 2022-08-15 | **Last Update:** 2022-08-15 |
| **CWE:**  [CWE-284](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html) |  |

### Risk Factor

|  | NVD Risk Rating | Qualys Risk Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CVSSv3.1 Score** | 7.3 / High | 6.7 / Medium |
| **CVSSv3.1 Vector (Base)** | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1) | [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1) |

## Description

Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux with signature manifest versions prior to 2.5.548.2 executes programs at various full pathnames without first making ownership and permission checks. Privilege escalation is possible on a system where a malicious actor with local write access to one of the vulnerable pathnames controlled by a non-root user installs arbitrary code, and the Qualys Cloud Agent is run as root. In such situations, an attacker could use the Qualys Cloud Agent to run arbitrary code as the root user.

## Solution

No action is required by customers. Qualys Cloud Agent manifests with manifest version 2.5.548.2 have been automatically updated across all regions effective immediately.

## Affected Products

| Product | Vulnerability Management | Policy Compliance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux Agent | **✓** | **✓** |
| Mac Agent | **✓** | **✓** |
| Solaris Agent | **✓** | **✓** |
| CoreOS | No | No |
| FreeBSD | **✓** | **✓** |
| Traditional Scanner (ML) | **✓** | **✓** |

## Severity Considerations

Qualys assesses the attack complexity for this vulnerability as High, as it requires local system access by an attacker and the ability to write malicious files to user system paths. This lowers the overall severity score from High to Medium.

## Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux: Possible Information Disclosure [DISPUTED]

| **Advisory ID:**  Q-PSA-2022-02 | **CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29550 |
| --- | --- |
| **Published:**  2022-08-15 | **Last Update:**  2022-08-15 |
| **CWE:**  [CWE-312](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html), [CWE-200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html) |  |

### Risk Factor

|  | NVD Risk Rating | Qualys Risk Rating |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **CVSSv3.1 Score** | 5.5, Medium | Unchanged |
| **CVSSv3.1 Vector** | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N&version=3.1) | Unchanged |

## Description

Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux writes the output of the *ps auxwwe* command to the /var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log file when the logging level is configured to trace. While customers often require this level of logging for troubleshooting, customer credentials or other secrets could be written to the Qualys logs from environment variables, if set by the customer.

## Dispute Rationale

Qualys disputes the validity of this vulnerability for the following reasons:

1. Qualys logs are stored locally on the customer device and the logs are only accessible by the Qualys Cloud Agent user OR root user on that device
2. Qualys customers have numerous options for setting lower logging levels for the Qualys Cloud Agent that would not collect the output of agent commands
3. Using cleartext credentials in environmental variables is not aligned with security best practices and should not be done (Reference <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/256.html> and <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/312.html>)

## Solution

Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux default logging level is set to informational. At this logging level, the output from the *ps auxwwe* is not written to the qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log. Qualys documentation has been updated to support customer decision-making on appropriate logging levels and related security considerations.

## Affected Products

| Product | Vulnerability Management | Policy Compliance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux Agent | **✓** | **✓** |
| Mac Agent | **✓** | **✓** |
| Solaris Agent | **✓** | **✓** |
| CoreOS | No | No |
| FreeBSD | **✓** | **✓** |

## FAQs

### What action must customers take to fix CVE-2022-29549?

**No action is required by Qualys customers**. Qualys released signature updates with manifest version 2.5.548.2 to address this CVE and has rolled the updates out across the Qualys Cloud Platform.

To quickly discover if there are any agents using older manifest versions, Qualys has released QID 376807 on August 15, 2022, in Manifest version *LX\_MANIFEST-2.5.555.4-3* for Qualys Cloud Agent for Linux only.

Customers may use QQL *vulnerabilities.vulnerability.qid:376807* in Qualys Cloud Agent, Qualys Global AssetView, Qualys VMDR, or Qualys CyberSecurity Asset Management to identify assets using older manifest versions.

### What action must customers take to fix CVE-2022-29550?

The default logging level for the Qualys Cloud Agent is set to information. At this level, the output of commands is not written to the Qualys log. If customers need to troubleshoot, they must change the logging level to trace in the configuration profile. We log the multi-pass commands in verbose mode, and non-multi-pass commands are logged only in trace mode.

![](https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/config-profile-edit.png)

Additional details were added to our documentation to help guide customers in their decision to enable either [Verbose level logging](https://www.qualys.com/docs/qualys-cloud-agent-linux-install-guide.pdf) or [Trace level logging](https://success.qualys.com/support/s/article/000002723).

### How would a customer determine if CVE-2022-29549 was exploited on an impacted device?

As a pre-requisite for CVE-2022-29549, an adversary would need to have already compromised the local system running the Qualys Cloud Agent. Common signs of a local account compromise include abnormal account activities, disabled AV and firewall rules, local logging turned off, and malicious files written to disk. File integrity monitoring logs may also provide indications that an attacker replaced key system files. Customers could also review trace level logging messages from the Qualys Cloud Agent to list files executed by the agent, and then correlate those logs to recently modified files on the system. The system files need to be examined using either antivirus software or manual analysis to determine if the files were malicious. Binary hash comparison and file monitoring are separate technologies and different product offerings from Qualys: [Qualys File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)](https://www.qualys.com/apps/file-integrity-monitoring/) and [Qualys Multi-Vector EDR](https://www.qualys.com/forms/endpoint-detection-response/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Brand%20Qualys%20Endpoint%20Detection%20Response%20APAC&utm_content=trial&leadsource=344570986&_bt=514471432992&kw=qualys+edr&_bm=e&_bn=g&_bk=qualys%20edr&gclid=CjwKCAjw9NeXBhAMEiwAbaY4llbjZPfcxwPzcVT_WcHwd74Wqb0707okZVnClhJma2p6-zmurG-R1hoCJJIQAvD_BwE).

### How does Qualys test the security of Qualys Cloud Agent?

Qualys product security teams perform continuous static and dynamic testing of new code releases. Senior application security engineers also perform manual code reviews. Additionally, Qualys performs periodic third-party security assessments of the complete Qualys Cloud Platform including the Qualys Cloud Agent. Lessons learned were identified as part of CVE-2022-29549 and new preventative and detective controls were added to build processes, along with updates to our developer training and development standards.

### Is there an updated version of Qualys Cloud Agent?  Why?

While a new agent is not required to address CVE-2022-29549, we updated Qualys Cloud Agent with an enhanced defense-in-depth mechanism for our customers to use if they choose. The new version offers three modes for running Vulnerability Management (VM) signature checks with each mode corresponding to a different privilege profile explained in our updated documentation.

New versions of the Qualys Cloud Agents for Linux were released in August 2022.

| **OS** | **Latest Version** |
| --- | --- |
| Linux Intel | 5.0 |
| Mac Intel | 3.17 |
| AIX | 4.17 |
| MAC M1 | 3.26 |
| Linux ARM | 4.18 |
| Linux PPC | 3.21 |

### For the new Qualys Cloud Agent, what modes and privileges does it offer over the previous version?

The new version provides different modes allowing customers to select from various privileges for running a VM scan.

The different modes available are:

* **Agent User Mode:** The Qualys Cloud Agent runs VM scans with the same privileges configured by the customer to run Qualys Cloud Agent

* **Safe Mode:** The Qualys Cloud Agent runs only the VM scan with lower privileges and would not run any command/binary with elevated privileges

* **Dynamically Privilege Elevation Mode**: The Qualys Cloud Agent runs the VM scan with lower privileges by default and will dynamically elevate the privileges to root access for only those commands that failed with permission issues with lower privileges

The documentation for different privileges for Qualys Cloud Agent users has been updated on [Qualys Linux Agent Guide](https://www.qualys.com/docs/qualys-cloud-agent-linux-install-guide.pdf).

**Customers needing additional information should contact their Technical Account Manager or email Qualys product security at** security@qualys.com**.**

Qualys takes the security and protection of its products seriously. If you believe you have identified a vulnerability in one of our products, please let us know at bugreport@qualys.com.

Cloud Agent Platform Availability for Linux

For the most current list of supported cloud agents with versions and modules on the
Qualys Cloud Platform, please refer to the following article: Cloud Agent Platform
Availability Matrix

A few things to consider...

Cloud Agent requirements

- Your hosts must be able to reach your Qualys Cloud Platform (or the Qualys Private
Cloud Platform) over HTTPS port 443. Log into the Qualys Cloud Platform and go to Help >
About to see the URL your hosts need to access.

- To install Cloud Agent for Linux, you must have root privileges, non-root with Sudo root
delegation, or non-root with sufficient privileges (VM license only). Proxy configuration is
supported. Learn more

Hardware Requirements

For Cloud Agent Linux, the following are minimum system requirements:

- The Cloud Agent requires minimum 512 MB RAM if you are using VM/PC. Minimum 1GB
RAM is required for VM/PC + FIM.

- Minimum 100 MB of available disk space is required.

Privileges - what are my options?

What are the installation steps?

Our Cloud Agent UI walks you through the steps to install agents on your hosts. Once the
agent is installed you will need to provision it using our agent configuration tool. You
might want to configure proxy settings for our agent to communicate with our cloud
platform.

Run as user and user’s default group

Typically, the agent installation requires root level access on the system (for example in
order to access the RPM database). After the Cloud Agent has been installed it can be
configured to run in a specific user and group context using our configuration tool. This
ability limits the level of access of the Cloud Agent. Learn more

Need help with troubleshooting?

We recommend you inspect the agent’s log file located here:

/var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-agent.log

Troubleshooting

Error messages

Privileges - what are my options?

The Qualys Cloud Agent offers multiple deployment methods to support an organization’s
security policy for running third-party applications and least privilege configuration. As
vulnerability and configuration assessments need to be comprehensive with
authenticated scans, the Cloud Agent installs as a daemon with SYSTEM level privileges
and does not require authentication records to access local system data and artifacts.

This can be updated to any of the following options.

1.Use a non-root account with sufficient privileges:

The specific privileges required are:

•

•

Execute “rpm” for automatic update

Agent requires certain commands to operate which vary from environment to
environment.

Non-root users with limited access may not be able to access certain areas of the system,
such as applications installed with root privileges, and may have insufficient results or
lack of functionality.

2.Use a non-root account with Sudo root delegation

Either the non-root user needs to be assigned direct sudo privileges assigned or through a
group membership. Ensure that NOPASSWD option is configured.

7

Get Started
Privileges - what are my options?

Here is an example of an agent user entry in sudoers file (where “agentuser” is the
username for the account that you use to install the Linux Agent):

%agentuser ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

You can also use secure Sudo. When you set UseSudo=1, the agent tries to find the custom
path in the secure_path parameter located in the /etc/sudoers file. This can be used to
restrict the path from where commands are picked up during data collection. If this
parameter is not set, the agent refers to the PATH variable to locate the command by
running sudo sh.

3.Use an account with root privileges

Typically, you may start with a comprehensive assessment for vulnerabilities and
misconfigurations, including privilege access for administrators and root. This agent
configuration provides the Cloud Agent for Linux with all the required privileges (for
example to access the RPM database) to conduct a complete assessment on the host
system and allows for high fidelity assessments with less management overhead.

However, after the Qualys Cloud Agent is installed, it can be configured to run as a specific
user and group context using our configuration tool. When you create a non-privileged
user with full sudo, the user account is exclusive to the Qualys Cloud Agent and you can
disable SSH/ remote login for that user if needed.

The Qualys Cloud Agent does not require SSH (Secure Shell). You can also assign a user
with specific permissions and categories of commands that the user can run. If the path is
not provided in the command, the system provides the path and only a privileged user can
set the PATH variables.

Considerations to Select an Option

The Qualys Cloud Agent uses multiple methods to collect metadata to provide asset
inventory, vulnerability management, and Policy Compliance (PC) use cases. Some of
these methods include running commands to collect a list of installed applications and
versions, running processes, network interfaces, and so on.

Root access is required for some detections, including most detections that are part of PC
(reading global config files related to system-wide security settings and gathering
information from more than one user account). There is an exceptionally low number of
QIDs in VM module that require root, other QIDs run fine without root. However, those
that do need elevated privileges are likely to result into False negatives, if the user does
not have the necessary privileges.

Qualys also provides a scan tool that identifies the commands that need root access in
your environment. For this scan tool, connect with the Qualys support team. You can
decide whether to elevate/grant the required permissions to run the commands or risk
losing visibility to the information. You can grant permissions only for the specific
commands/binaries that are failing.

8

Get Started
Privileges - what are my options?

Qualys sanitizes the PATH variable to remove any directory which is world writable as a
security measure, which is designed to ensure that the Qualys Cloud Agent does not
execute any custom-made scripts. This provides the option to harden or allow the path,
where you can configure the set of allowed directories, on which the commands can be
executed during our data collection.

Qualys uses the system-appended paths to run or assume root integrity. As per NIST SP
800-53 Revision 5, control for Vulnerability Monitoring and Scanning RA-5 indicates that
in certain situations, the nature of the vulnerability scanning may be more intrusive and
require privileged access authorization to selected system components to facilitate more
thorough vulnerability scanning.

For PC scans, we require the sudo/root privilege. With non-root privilege, the PC report is
unreliable and does not provide a complete covering of CIS&DISA policies. As per CIS
benchmarks, root privileges are required for specific detections, including most detections
that are part of PC (reading global config files related to system-wide security settings and
gathering information from more than one user account). Refer to any CIS benchmark (for
example, https://workbench.cisecurity.org/benchmarks/493) on Linux which broadly
assumes that operations are being performed as the root user.

Following is the paragraph from the CIS benchmark document:

“The guidance within broadly assumes that operations are being performed as the root
user. Non-root users may not be able to access certain areas of the system, especially after
remediation has been performed. It is advisable to verify the root user’s path integrity and
the integrity of any programs being run prior to execution of commands and scripts
included in this benchmark.”

For Patch Management, Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), and File Integrity
Monitoring (FIM) modules, use an account with root privileges to hook into a system,
perform real-time-time monitoring, to install patches etc., as these modules are not
dependent on any signatures/command execution.

Installation
Tips and best practices

Installation

It’s easy to install Cloud Agent for Linux. We’ll walk you through the steps quickly.

Qualys provides installers and packages for each supported operating system that are
coded for each Qualys platform. It's not possible to connect an agent coded for one
platform to another platform. Organizations can use their existing software distribution
tools (SCCM, BigFix, rpm, Casper, etc.) to install the agent into target machines. Cloud
Agent can be installed into gold images including VM templates and cloud provider
images such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Platform.

The platform supports detection of duplicate agent IDs and automatically re-provisions
the duplicate agents. The section Install Agents in Gold Images describes how to install an
agent into a gold image without initial provisioning. This is the recommended method to
prevent duplicate asset records.

Customers using software distribution tools must package the Qualys-provided installer
along with the specific Activation Key and Customer ID strings to install properly. Do not
package up the artifacts that are installed by the agent into your own installer as the
installation environment is keyed for that specific machine when the agent is installed;
doing so will create duplicates that the platform may not be able to easily de-duplicate.

Keep in mind - Depending on your environment, you might need to take steps to support
communications between agent hosts on your network and the Qualys Cloud Platform.

Tips and best practices

What is an activation key? You’ll need an agent activation key to install agents. This
provides a way to group agents and bind them to your subscription with Qualys Cloud
Platform. You can create different keys for various business functions and users.

Benefits of adding asset tags to an activation key Tags assigned to your activation key will
be automatically assigned to agent hosts. This helps you manage your agents and report
on agent hosts.

Running the agent installer You’ll need to run the installer from an elevated command
prompt, or use a systems management tool using elevated privileges.

10

Installation
How to download Agent Installer

Be sure to activate agents to provision agents for modules - Vulnerability Management
(VM), Policy Compliance (PC), or File Integrity Monitoring (FIM). Activating an agent for a
module consumes an agent license. You can set up auto activation by defining modules
for activation keys, or do it manually in the Cloud Agent UI.

What happens if I skip activation? Agents will sync inventory information only to the
cloud platform (IP address, OS, DNS and NetBIOS names, MAC address), host assessments
will not be performed.

How many agents can I install? You can install any number of agents but can activate an
agent only if you have a license. The Agents tab in the Cloud Agent UI tells you about your
installed agents.

Check to be sure agents are connected Once installed agents connect to the Qualys Cloud
Platform and provision themselves. You can see agent status on the Agents tab - this is
updated continuously. If your agent doesn’t have a status, it has not successfully
connected to the cloud platform and you need to troubleshoot.

net-tools package You may need to install the net-tools package on agent endpoints, if not
already present, in order to run network commands. This is required on systems running
Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and CentOS version 7.1 since some
commands like netstat, /sbin/ifconfig, route are deprecated.

How to download Agent Installer

Here’s how to download an installer from the Qualys Cloud Platform and get the

Installation steps

What you’ll need

To install cloud agents, you’ll need to download the Cloud Agent installer and get the
associated ActivationID and CustomerID. Just log into the Qualys Cloud Platform, go to the
Cloud Agent (CA) module, and follow the installation steps for Linux (.rpm) or Linux (.deb)
to get everything you need.

Cloud Agent requirements

Steps to install Agents

1. Copy the Qualys Cloud Agent installer onto the target host.

2. Install the Qualys Cloud Agent using the following commands for x64. Depending on
the package(x64 or ARM64), following commands varies.

Linux (.rpm)

> sudo rpm -ivh qualys-cloud-agent.x86_64.rpm
> sudo /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
ActivationId=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
CustomerId=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
ServerUri=<qualys_pod_url>/CloudAgent

Linux (.deb)

> sudo dpkg --install qualys-cloud-agent.x86_64.deb
> sudo /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
ActivationId=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
CustomerId=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
ServerUri=<qualys_pod_url>/CloudAgent

13

Installation
Installation steps

Install Agents in Gold Images

These steps are similar to installing on Linux (.rpm) hosts, with an extra step to restart the
Qualys Cloud Agent service and AMI instance.

1. Start the Gold Image instance.

2. Copy the Qualys Cloud Agent RPM onto the instance.

3. Install the Qualys Cloud Agent RPM using the following command:

> sudo rpm -ivh qualys-cloud-agent.x86_64.rpm

4. Run the Qualys Cloud Agent installation command:

> sudo /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
ActivationId=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
CustomerId=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
ServerUri=<qualys_pod_url>/CloudAgent

5. Stop Qualys Cloud Agent service:

> sudo service qualys-cloud-agent stop

6. Stop the instance and create an image out of the instance. This completes the bake-in
process.

When the instance is started it will activate the Cloud Agent which will provision itself
and continue functioning as expected.

Relocation with Linux RPM Installer

Linux RPM installer now supports up to three relocation paths during the installation
process if there is a need to install the Cloud Agents in locations different from the default
locations.

Any/all of the following agent categories can be relocated:

- Binaries/Libraries/Data- Default location: /usr/local/qualys relocated to <any
path>/qualys.

- Configuration - Default location: /etc/qualys relocated to <any path>/qualys.

- Log Files - Default location: /var/log/qualys relocated to <any path>/qualys.

The relocation uses standard RPM relocation capabilities that specifies the default

location (listed above) and the new location. Example installation argument -

rpm --relocate /usr/local=/opt/ --relocate /etc=/etc/opt/config
--relocate/var/log=/var/opt -ivh qualys-cloud-agent-
<package>x86_64.rpm

Same permissions as that of the default directories are set on the relocated directories.

Symbolic links are used in each of the default locations to reference the new locations

and are required to be present in the default locations

14

Installation
Installation steps

Notes: Relocation is only available for new agent installations.

- You cannot relocate an existing installation.

- For relocating an existing installation, uninstall the existing installation completely and
execute a new installation. Note that this creates a new agent UUID for the installation.

What happens next?

We’ll start syncing asset data to the cloud!

Once installed an agent connects to the Qualys Cloud Platform and provisions itself. We
would expect you to see your first asset discovery results within a few minutes. The first
assessment scan in the cloud takes some time, after that scans complete as soon as new
host metadata is uploaded to the cloud platform.

Troubleshooting

You’ll find helpful information in Qualys online help.

Using the Host ID from Previous Installation

If you are reinstalling the agent on the same machine, and you want to reuse the earlier
hostid, set HostIdSearchDir to /root/hostdir.

Installation
Proxy configuration

Proxy configuration

Good to Know By default the Cloud Agent for Linux will operate in non-proxy mode. The
agent can be configured to use an HTTPS proxy for internet access.

Note:

- For Azure Security Center (ASC), use an HTTP proxy.

- If proxy connection fails then agent will NOT attempt a direct connection outbound (Fail
Closed).

What are my options?

The agent can be configured to use an HTTPS proxy in one of these ways:

1) /etc/sysconfig/qualys-cloud-agent - applies to Cloud Agent for Linux (.rpm)

2) /etc/default/qualys-cloud-agent - applies to Cloud Agent for Linux (.deb)

3) /etc/environment - applies to Cloud Agent for Linux (.rpm) and Linux (.deb)

Tip - Option 3) is a better choice if the systemwide proxy will be used by the agent.

Tell me the steps

Here are the steps to enable the Linux agent to use a proxy for communication with our
cloud platform:

1) if /etc/sysconfig/qualys-cloud-agent file doesn't exist create it

2) add 1 of the following lines to the file (1 line only):

https_proxy=https://[<username>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>]
qualys_https_proxy=https://[<username>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>]

where <username> and <password> are specified if the https proxy uses authentication. If
special characters are embedded in the username or password (e.g. @, :, $) they need to be
url-encoded. where <host> is the proxy server's IPv4 address or FQDN. where <port> is the
proxy's port number.

If the proxy is specified with the https_proxy environment variable, it will be used for all
commands performed by the Cloud Agent. If the proxy is specified with the
qualys_https_proxy environment variable, it will only be used by the Cloud Agent to
communicate with our cloud platform.

Note: You can use the Proxy Configuration Encryption Utility to encrypt the user name
and password that you provide to the proxy environment variable.

3) change the permissions using these commands:

Linux (.rpm)

chown <cloud_agent_user> /etc/sysconfig/qualys-cloud-agent
chmod 600 /etc/sysconfig/qualys-cloud-agent

16

Installation
Proxy configuration

Linux (.deb)

chown <cloud_agent_user> /etc/default/qualys-cloud-agent
chmod 600 /etc/default/qualys-cloud-agent

Where <cloud_agent_user> is a user configured through the Configuration Tool.

4) restart qualys-cloud-agent service using the following command:

service qualys-cloud-agent restart

PAC file support

You can also set automatic proxy with the Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file. The URL to
the PAC file must be set in http_proxy or https_proxy in the
https_proxy=pac+http://url.to/proxy.pac format.

For different ways to configure the agent to use proxy, see What are my options? section.

Note: You can use PAC files only with the Cloud Agent for Linux version 5.0 and later.

Need to Bypass Proxy?

By default the Cloud Agent for Linux will operate in non-proxy mode. But in the event, if
you are already using proxy mode and need to switch to non-proxy mode, you need to
configure agent to use no_proxy in /etc/environment. Environment variable 'no_proxy' is
used to bypass proxy. Curl library honors 'no_proxy' environment variable. If ‘no_proxy’ is
set, curl will not use proxy even if any proxy environment variable is set.

Here are the steps to enable the Linux agent to use a no_proxy for communication with
our cloud platform:

1) Edit /etc/environment file.

2) Add following line (bold faced) where qualys_https_proxy is mentioned:

qualys_https_proxy=https://[<username>:<password>@]<host>[:<port>]
no_proxy=<pod domain name>

Note: For init.d based systems, you need to prefix 'export' to ‘no_proxy’ line.

17

Installation
Multiple Proxy Server support in Proxy URL (Linux Agent 2.5 or later)

Multiple Proxy Server support in Proxy URL (Linux Agent 2.5 or
later)

The Cloud Agent has support for multiple proxy servers defined in the Proxy URL. You can
have up to five proxy servers included in the proxy URL.

Note: You can define multiple proxy servers in PAC file in Cloud Agent for Linux 5.0 and
later. To view how to configure multiple proxy servers in PAC file, refer to PAC file vendor's
documentation.

Each time the Cloud Agent connects to the Qualys Platform, it always uses the first proxy
server in the ordered list.

If the connection using the first proxy server fails, the Cloud Agent will failover to the next
configured proxy in case of http failures. If the connections using all the configured
proxies fail, the Cloud Agent attempts a direct connection to the Qualys Cloud Platform.

To activate this feature on the newly-installed Agent, the ProxyFailOpen parameter must
be set to 1.

You can use the Configuration Tool to the set the proxy order to be sequential or random.
The agent does not maintain a history of last proxy server used.

This proxy configuration can be used with the Qualys Gateway Service or third-party
proxy servers. There is no requirement that the failover proxy servers need to be on the
same subnet as the first proxy server; as long as the Cloud Agent can connect to other
proxy servers even on other subnets, the agent will use those proxy server(s) if the first
proxy server is not available.

You can configure multiple proxies in any of the files mentioned in the section What are
my options?

Multiple proxies can be configured with qualys_https_proxy or https_proxy environment
variables. It is recommended that you provide multiple proxies in the qualys_https_proxy
environment variable.

The following example shows how to set multiple proxies:
qualys_https_proxy=”https://[<username>:<password>@]<host1>:<port>;
https://[<username>:<password>@]<host2>:<port>;
https://[<username>:<password>@]<host3>:<port>”

The list of proxies must be given in double quotes (“...”) and separated by a semi-colon (;),
and if ";" is embedded in username/password, you must url-encode it. You can use the
Proxy Configuration Encryption Utility to encrypt the user name and/or password that
you provide to the proxy environment variable.

You can combine multiple proxy certificates into a single file, and place it at same location
as earlier /etc/qualys/cloud-agent/cert/ca-bundle.crt. Ensure that all certificates are valid,
else you might get SSL/certificate errors.

Note: If you update the proxy settings, Cloud Agent must be restarted.

Agent daemon process “qualys-cloud-agent”

The agent runs as daemon process “qualys-cloud-agent”.

The agent runs various read-only commands during the scanning process. These are the
same commands run by a scan using a scanner appliance. Learn more

https://community.qualys.com/message/16520

Some transient files are created during agent execution

/usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/Config.db
- this is the current agent configuration

/usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/manifests/*.db
- this contains manifests used during agent based scans

Installation
Using the Host ID from Previous Installation

Using the Host ID from Previous Installation

If you are reinstalling an agent on a host and you wish to use the same hostid used in the
previous installation, set the hostid directory location to the same location used in the
previous installation.

For example, let's say in the previous installation you use HostIdSearchDir=/root/hostdir
while setting the activation key, it creates hostid under /root/hostdir/qualys/. When you
uninstall the agent it doesn't remove /root/hostdir/qualys/hostid.

If you are reinstalling the agent on the same machine, and you want to reuse the earlier
hostid, set HostIdSearchDir to /root/hostdir.

Configuration for Agent-ID Service

The Cloud Agent needs high privileges to activate the agent-id service on selected ports.
Once agent-id service is activated, the scanner connects to the defined ports and retrieves
correlation ID during the scan.

However, if you do not want the agent-id service to run with high privileges, use one of the
following methods.

- Run the agent-id service as a non-root user regardless of the UseSudo value when
User=option is configured. This is applicable only for Cloud Agent Linux version 4.9 and
later.

or

- Configure the Cloud Agent using non-root privileges by using the following command:

/usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
User='username'  UseSudo=1

Configuration Tool
Command line options

Configuration Tool

The Agent Configuration Tool gives you many options for configuring Cloud Agent for
Linux after installation. You’ll find this tool at /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/qualys-
cloud-agent.sh.

Our configuration tool allows you to:

- Provision agents

- Configure logging - set a custom log level and log file path

- Enable Sudo to run all data collection commands

- Configure the daemon to run as a specific user and/or group

- Change the ActivationID, CustomerID and/or platform configuration

The Agent will automatically pick up changes made through the configuration tool so
there is no need to restart the agent or reboot the agent host.

Note: While switching from low privileged user to high privileged user, it is not
recommended to directly run the configuration tool on the already running agents. The
user should first stop the agent and then run the configuration tool to switch to a high
privileged user.

Command line options

qualys-cloud-agent.sh supports these command line options.

ServerUri takes the URL of the Qualys shared Pod or PCP
you want to migrate the Agent to, in the following format:
ServerUri=<http_url>/CloudAgent
where <http_url> is the URL of the Qualys shared Pod or
PCP.
If the subscription is on the same POD, the ServerUri is the
same.
Use this option along with ActivationId and CustomerId in
order to move the agent to another Qualys shared Pod or
PCP.
Note: The agent requires the appropriate Activation ID and
Customer ID that are on the new subscription/platform.
The original IDs cannot be used as they are unique per
subscription.

Execution of a command is dropped if the time taken to
execute is more than the specified value. Default timeout is
1800 seconds (30 minutes).

Specify the Linux niceness scale between -20 to 19 to set a
priority for the Qualys cloud agent process. The lower the
number the more priority the agent process gets. Default
value is zero.

Set UseAuditDispatcher to 1 if you want to run FIM along
with auditd enabled.
Agent version 2.0.2 required auditd to be disabled on the
host. These agents when upgraded to 2.1 through selfpatch
retain this setting where UseAuditDispatcher is set to 0.
Agents with 1.x version are set with UseAuditDispatcher=1
on selfpatch to 2.1. Fresh installation of 2.1 agent comes
with UseAuditDispatcher=1 (by default) where you can run
FIM along with auditd enabled.

If you are using multiple proxies, set the proxy order to be
sequential or random.
Sequential: QualysProxyOrder=sequential OR
QualysProxyOrder=seq
Random: QualysProxyOrder=random

(This is supported for Agent version between 2.6.4 to 3.3)
This option will enabled the Agent to upload at the
configured VM scan interval and adding a randomized
interval. The random interval can be any value between 0
and the configured MaxRandomScanInterval seconds.
MaxRandomScanInterval can be set to any value between
0 (default) to 4294967295.

ProxyFailOpen

Set the ProxyFailOpen to 1 to enable the proxy failover
behavior as described in the Multiple Proxy Server support
in Proxy URL (Linux Agent 2.5 or later) section.
Note: This is applicable for the Cloud Agent for Linux
version 6.2 and later.

Limitations of using UseSudo=1

If you configure the cloud agent for UseSudo=1 to run commands using the sudo
escalation method, you may face any of the following issues:

- Commands run by the cloud agent or any script added in the cloud agent manifest, fail
to get the custom path set in the PATH environment.

- Scan results show empty values for service_list, bios_info, and service_info, when the
agents fails to find related path in the PATH environment.

This happens because when you set UseSudo=1, the agent tries to find the custom path in
the secure_path parameter located in the /etc/sudoers file. If this parameter is not set, the
agent then tries to find the custom path in the path that is used when you run sudo sh.

To resolve this issue, add your custom path or the path used by the agent while scanning
for service_list, bios_info, and service_info, to the secure_path parameter. If you have
disabled secure_path parameter, add the respective paths to the path that is used when
you run sudo sh.

Alternatively, you can configure the agent for UseSudo=0.

Note: For RHEL platforms, if you run argument UseSudo=0 with agent configuration tool
and do revocation, qualys-cloud-agent process is still running in background. Ideally,
qualys-cloud-agent process should have stopped after revocation. This is known
limitation with UseSudo=0 while it works for UseSudo=1.

Configuration Tool
Use cases

Use cases

Example 1 – Provision Agent

The following example shows how to provision Qualys Cloud Agent. Please note that this
method of activation will assume that root user should be used by the agent.

$ /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
ActivationId="022224c8-31c7-11e5-b4f7-0021ccba987e"
CustomerId="146556fa-31c7-11e5-87b6-0021ccba987e"

Example 2 – Use non-root account

The following example shows how to configure Qualys Cloud Agent to use a non-root
account for running data collection commands.

$ /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
ActivationId="022224c8-31c7-11e5-b4f7-0021ccba987e"
CustomerId="146556fa-31c7-11e5-87b6-0021ccba987e" UseSudo=1
User=scanuser
Group=wheel

Keep in mind - A new group needs to exist when the configuration command runs. The
expectation is that the non-root user will be added to the specified group to allow it to
access binary and temporary files that comprise Qualys Cloud Agent. In order to perform
unattended data collection the non-root user needs to have sudo privilege without a
password.

Example 3 – Raise logging level

It is also possible to instruct Qualys Cloud Agent to log events at a higher than normal
logging level using the following command:

$ /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
LogLevel=4

Note: We’ve omitted the ActivationID and CustomerID parameters to illustrate the
configuration tool can be used to adjust the log level after provisioning.

Example 4 – Change platform

The following example shows how to configure Qualys Cloud Agent to re-provision to a
new platform:

qualys-cloud-agent.sh ActivationId="022224c8-31c7-11e5-b4f7-
0021ccba987e" CustomerId="146556fa-31c7-11e5-87b6-0021ccba987e"
ServerUri="https://qagpublic.qg2.apps.qualys.com/CloudAgent"

On Demand Scan

On Demand Scan

You can run an On Demand Scan to instruct the agent to immediately scan as long as the
agent is not already scanning. The On Demand Scan runs independently of the interval
scan that you configure in the Configuration Profile and will reset the scan interval on the
local agent after a successful scan.

Prerequisite: The agent must be activated for that specific Qualys application for which
you are running the On Demand Scan. When activated, the Agent downloads manifests
for that application from the Qualys platform; if the manifest is not present for that type,
On Demand Scan will not execute.

Use the cloudagentctl.sh script to run the OnDemand Scan. You’ll find this script at
/usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/.

># ./cloudagentctl.sh action={demand} type={vm|pc|inv|udc|sca|vmpc}
cputhrottle={0-1000}

Where action and type are mandatory parameters.

action is “demand”, meaning an On Demand Scan.

type is the application for which you want to run the scan (the agent must be activated for
the respective application first).

Note: "vmpc" is a legacy application manifest and most likely may not be present.

cputhrottle is 1-1000. Default is 0, which is no throttling.

For example, to initiate an On Demand Scan for the Vulnerability Management
application (VM) with no throttling:

># ./cloudagentctl.sh action=demand type=vm
The script calls the agent to run asynchronously in the background and returns to the
shell prompt. The script prints a ControlId that you can track in the log file. The ControlId
is the timestamp of the script initiation, e.g. On-Demand-Request ControlId:
20200427151136.0

The On Demand Scan logs to the same log file as the agent at /var/log/qualys/qualys-
cloud-agent.log. You can find the logging for the scan initiation and completion in the log
file.

2020-04-27 15:11:36.474 [qualys-cloud-
agent][9710]:[Information]:[140048573286144]:OnDemandRequest Params:
ControlID=20200427151136.0, Action=OnDemand, Type=VM, CPUThrottle=0"

If the agent is currently performing an interval scan for the same type, the On Demand
Scan will delay waiting for the currently running scan to finish. The script will print a log
line with this status.

2020-04-27 15:11:36.474 [qualys-cloud-
agent][9710]:[Information]:[140048573286144]:Interval Event of same type

agent][9710]:[Information]:[140048573286144]:OnDemand request for
Control ID : 20200427151136.0 will be delayed.

If the script errors due to the manifest file not being present, check whether the Cloud
Agent is activated for that particular application. If agent is activated but you still get
manifest related errors while running the On Demand Scan command, the agent may not
have downloaded the manifest for that application. You can manually force a manifest
download by deactivating then reactivating the agent for that application from the Cloud
Agent user interface module. If that doesn't correct the issue, contact Qualys Support.

Once an On Demand Scan is complete the results are logged in the log file located at
/var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-agent.log.

Best Practices
Upgrading Cloud Agent

Best Practices

Here are some best practices for managing your cloud agents. Refer to the Cloud Agent
Technical Whitepaper for additional documentation and best practices.

Upgrading Cloud Agent

The Qualys Cloud Platform can be used to upgrade agents to newer available versions
when agents check into the platform, depending on the settings in the Configuration
Profile.

Software distribution tools can package the Cloud Agent installer of a newer version to
upgrade already installed agents. In those cases the agents are not configured to auto-
upgrade versions.

Use following commands to upgrade your Cloud Agent:

Linux RPM based system

rpm -Uvh package_file.rpm

Linux Debian based system

dpkg -i package_file.deb

Note: If needed, restart agent using /usr/local/qualys/cloud-
agent/bin/qagent_restart.sh command.

Uninstalling Cloud Agent

Uninstalling the agent from the Cloud Agent module UI or API

When you uninstall a cloud agent using the Cloud Agent module user interface or Cloud
Agent API, the agent and license is removed from the Qualys subscription. We’ll also purge
the associated agent host record and scan results for any licensed modules, i.e.
Vulnerability Management, Policy Compliance.

Uninstalling the agent from the host itself

When you uninstall a cloud agent from the host itself (using the uninstall utility), the
agent record, its license usage, and scan results are still present in the Qualys
subscription. In order to remove the agent’s host record, license, and scan results use the
Cloud Agent module user interface or Cloud Agent API to uninstall the agent.

Linux RPM based system

sudo rpm -e qualys-cloud-agent

Linux Debian based system

sudo dpkg --purge qualys-cloud-agent

28

Best Practices
Agentless Tracking and Cloud Agents

Agentless Tracking and Cloud Agents

Say you’re already using Agentless Tracking on hosts and now you’re ready to install
Cloud Agent on the same hosts. You’ll want to use the same host ID tag installed on the
host. This will help you to avoid duplicate assets for the same host in your account.

You can configure the location of the host ID file installed on your Linux hosts with the
recommended default of /etc (the agent will create/use a 'qualys' directory under /etc).
This is recommended best practice if you are interested in using Linux Agent and
Agentless Tracking to evaluate the same host.

Once configured, the same file with the same host ID tag is accessed by our service when
the host is evaluated using 1) Agentless Tracking AND 2) Cloud Agent.

What are the steps?

1) Check your Unix authentication record

This is the record you’re using to access the system using Agentless Tracking. You’ll see
the location of the host ID file configured for the authentication record.

Want help with Agentless Tracking? Log into the Qualys Cloud Platform, go to Help >
Contact Support and search for Agentless Tracking.

2) Install the Agent

Use the agent configuration tool (qualys-cloud-agent.sh) and the HostIdSearchDir option
to install the Linux Agent and configure the location of the host ID file. Be sure this
location matches the location defined in your authentication record. By default
HostIdSearchDir is set to /etc/. To stay consistent with the Agentless Tracking location
Qualys appends “/qualys/hostid” to the path provided.

Example - Install as root user and set host ID file to /mydir/qualys/hosted

$ /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin/qualys-cloud-agent.sh
ActivationId="022224c8-31c7-11e5-b4f7-0021ccba987e"
CustomerId="146556fa-31c7-11e5-87b6-0021ccba987e"
HostIdSearchDir="/mydir/

29

Known Issues

Known Issues

Here are some known issues/limitations in the cloud agents.

–

FIM rules displayed using the command auditctl do not show system calls. The
rules work successfully even though system calls are not seen.

– There is audit limitation to set the full directory path while configuring profile for

FIM. You can set the limited path in the Rule Details from module - FIM >
Configuration > Profiles. Use Case: If you have a file (for example, a file with
filename) under directory /root/test/directoryname and if you delete
directoryname, audit system does not provide correct file path. In that case the
file present with /root/test/directoryname/filename is considered as
/root/test/filename by fimc process.

– Audit rules should not have rules to exclude EOE and CWD audit records in order
to parse a event in the agent. You need to restart your agent after removing these
rules.

–

For CentOS 7.6.1810, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6, and Amazon Linux 2, rename
event with mv command does not work if you have created FIM config profile with
rule to rename a directory or a file.

– Cloud Agent with version 3.0 or later terminates when user configures invalid

sudo command using qualys-cloud-agent.sh script or HostID file has insufficient
permissions.

–

If the remediation manifest is received during polling before clone detection, it will
be executed by both the agents. If the clone machine acknowledges manifest
before the master starts polling, master agent won't receive remediation manifest,
but the status will be updated as per status reported by the clone instance.

– Remediation manifest execution fails if you switch from root user to non-sudo

user while execution is in progress. You must execute the remediation manifest
with the root user.

–

–

For the Debian based systems, software installedDate is always shown as 1970-01-
01 as these systems do not save the date in their package database. Therefore, the
cloud agent cannot capture date and it’s shown default as 1970-01-01.

For the SUSE 15 SP4 system, the audit.service file contains
protectSystem=full parameter. This parameter sets read only access to all
the sensitive folders and prohibits to create socket files. You can use/add
ReadWritePaths parameter in audit.service file to select the files to give read-
write permissions. When you add ReadWritePaths=/usr/local/qualys/ in
/usr/lib/systemd/system/auditd.service file, the required socket files are
created. Restart the auditd service and cloud agent service to run the EDR
process.

Certificate Support on RHEL 5.4

Certificate Support on RHEL 5.4

Cloud agent installed on RHEL 5.4 may throw this error while trying to communicate with
the Qualys Platform. This happens when the certificate files are not present on the host
asset.

Http request failed: Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with
given CA certificates: SSL certificate problem: unable to get
local issuer certificate

To fix this issue, you must manually create the certificate files, and place them in the
appropriate location on the host asset.

Create the two cert files: cert1.crt and cert2.crt. Paste the contents in a text editor, and
then save the file with the extension “.crt”.

Use the following commands to append the contents of cer1.crt and cert2.crt at the end of
/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

cat cert1.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
cat cert2.crt >> /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

Now restart the QAgent Service.

Certificate Support on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11

Certificate Support on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11

Cloud agent installed on SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 may throw the following error for the
certificate ca-bundle.crt when trying to communicate with the Qualys Platform. This
happens when the certificate files are not present on the host asset.

[qualys-cloud-agent][8056]:[Error]:Http request failed:Problem
with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?): error setting
certificate verify locations:
CAfile: /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.crt
CApath: none

To fix this issue, you must manually install the certificate files in the appropriate location
on the host asset. You can either use the certificate files from your existing RHEL or
CentOS assets or download the certificate files from the following location:

https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html

Download the file cacert.pem and rename it to ca-bundle.pem.

Copy the certificate files (ca-bundle.pem) at the following default location on SUSE Linux
Enterprise 11:

/etc/ssl/

If you want to use a non default location, ensure that the directory path is added in the
/etc/qualys/cloud-agent/qagent.config file in the following manner:

{
 "os": "Suse",
  "cafile": "<CustomizedPath>"
}

Now restart the QAgent Service.

Proxy Configuration Encryption Utility

Proxy Configuration Encryption Utility

You can use the Proxy Configuration Encryption utility to encrypt the user name and/or
password (as needed) that you provide to the proxy environment variable
qualys_https_proxy or https_proxy.

The string-util utility is included in the Cloud Agent installation package. Install or extract
the Cloud Agent installation package to get the utility.

The string-util utility is to be used once on any system where it's installed to encrypt the
values that will be used on all systems running Cloud Agent that have the same
credentials. It is not required to run the utility on each system running Cloud Agent.

To use the encryption utility:

Go to /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/bin, and then export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable
to /usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/lib.

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/qualys/cloud-agent/lib

Use the following command to run the utility to encrypt the user name and/or password.
If you want to encrypt both, run the utility twice to separately encrypt the user name and
password.

Note: You need root privileges to run string-util. If the user name or password contain
special characters (e.g., @, :, $) they need to be url-encoded prior to using the utility.

To encrypt the user name (use double quotes):

./string-util "<user name_to_be_encrypted>"

For example,

./string-util "sys_account"

To encrypt the password (use double quotes):

./string-util "<password_to_be_encrypted>"

The utility returns the user name or password in encoded format.

For example,

sRpSHQP582a1+gaJwHOm3g==

Once you get the encrypted user name add/or password, unset the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variable by using the following command:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=

34

Proxy Configuration Encryption Utility

Provide the encrypted user name and password to your proxy environment variable.

qualys_https_proxy=https://[<#encrypted_username>:<#encrypted_password>@
]<host>[:<port>]

The # delimiter indicates to the Cloud Agent that the user name and password are
encrypted. Not including the # indicates that the user name and password are in plain text
format.

For example (only encrypting password):

qualys_https_proxy=https://sys_account:#sRpSHQP582a1+gaJwHOm3g==@proxy.m
yco.com:8080

For example (encrypting username and password):

qualys_https_proxy=https://#uWpsHMSY932b2+fdcH723d==:#sRpSHQP582a1+gaJwH
Om3g==@proxy.myco.com:8080

### Installation

I've successfully installed virtually every version of Firebird from 1.0.0 on up on Linux. I've never tried to install them on any other platform.

There are 2 versions of Firebird: Classic Server (CS) and Super Server (SS). Classic Server only allows a single connection while Super Server allows multiple connections. I recommend using Super Server and this document describes its installation.

Firebird is available on Fedora using yum and may be installed using:

```
yum install firebird-superserver
```

It is also available on Ubuntu using apt-get and may be installed using:

```
apt-get install firebirdversion-super
```

Where *version* is replaced with the version you want to install.

Binary and source distributions of Firebird in many different formats (including tar.gz and RPM) for many different platforms are also available at the [Firebird web site](https://www.firebirdsql.org/).

The tar.gz distributions come with an install script. The RPM distributions can be installed using *rpm -i*.

Firebird distributions from the Firebird web site prior to version 1.5 create a directory called /opt/interbase. Firebird versions 1.5 higher create /opt/firebird.

Some rpm's of Firebird versions 1.5 and higher leave /opt/firebird owned by root, with -r-xr-xr-x permissions. This is wrong and will cause the server not to start. Change the permissions and ownership as follows (as root):

```

```

Many versions of Firebird from the web site require libstdc++.so.5 but most Linux distributions ship with a more recent version. If your system doesn't have /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.5 then you may need to install a compatibility library. On Fedora, you need to install compat-libstdc++-33 as follows (as root):

```

yum install compat-libstdc++-33

```
### Setting Up Your Environment

At this point, you should set up your environment. The Firebird client is called *isql-fb* in some distributions, but in others, it is just called *isql*. Note that *unixODBC* and *Sybase* have a client called *isql* as well which could be installed in /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin, /opt/sybase\*/bin or some other path. If you have *unixODBC* or *Sybase* installed, you'll have to decide which client you want the *isql* command to run. If you want *isql* to run the Firebird client, follow the instructions below. Otherwise, you'll have to run the Firebird *isql* client by its full pathname.

If you are using Firebird prior to version 1.5, in the configuration script for your shell, add */opt/interbase/bin* to your PATH environment variable. If you are using Firebird version 1.5 or higher, add */opt/firebird/bin* to your PATH environment variable. You can add the paths as follows.

For Bourne shells:

```

PATH=$PATH:/opt/firebird/bin
export PATH

```

or

```

PATH=$PATH:/opt/interbase/bin
export PATH

```

For C-shells:

```

setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/firebird/bin

```

or

```

setenv PATH ${PATH}:/opt/interbase/bin

```
### Users and Passwords

Use the *gsec* utility to create a new user named *testuser* with password *testpassword*.

There are some quirks though...

Firebird user names are case insensitive and can be up to 31 characters long. Firebird passwords are case sensitive and can be up to 32 characters long, but only the first 8 characters are actually used.

Sometimes the /etc/hosts.equiv file must contain an entry for localhost and possibly localhost.localdomain for the *gsec* to function at all, so if you're having trouble, try that.

*gsec* must always be run as root, and sometimes from within the directory containing the security database.

The instructions are slightly different for different versions of Firebird.

For Firebird 2.0 and higher, the installation process creates a security database called *security2.fdb* containing host and user privileges and an administrative user named *SYSDBA* with either a randomly generated password or the password *masterkey*. In the case of a randomly generated password, it is listed in *SYSDBA.password*.

Run *gsec* from within the directory containing the file *security2.fdb*.

Create a user as follows (replacing *masterkey* with the sysdba password if it isn't masterkey)...

```

[root@localhost root]# /opt/firebird/bin/gsec -user sysdba -password masterkey
GSEC> add testuser -pw testpassword
Warning - maximum 8 significant bytes of password used
GSEC> quit

```

For Firebird 1.5, the installation process creates a security database called *security.fdb* containing host and user privileges and an administrative user named *SYSDBA* with a randomly generated password. This password is listed in *SYSDBA.password*.

Run *gsec* from within the directory containing the file *security.fdb*.

Create a user as follows (replacing *masterkey* with the sysdba password if it isn't masterkey)...

```

[root@localhost root]# /opt/firebird/bin/gsec -user sysdba -password masterkey
GSEC> add testuser
GSEC> modify testuser -pw testpassword
Warning - maximum 8 significant bytes of password used
GSEC> quit

```

For Firebird prior to version 1.5, the installation process creates a security database named *isc4.gdb* containing host and user privileges and an administrative user named *SYSDBA* with a password of either *changeme* or *masterkey*.

Run *gsec* from within the directory containing the file *isc4.gdb*.

Create a user as follows...

```

[root@localhost interbase]# /opt/interbase/bin/gsec
GSEC> add testuser
GSEC> modify testuser -pw testpassword
Warning - maximum 8 significant bytes of password used
GSEC> quit

```
### Starting the Database at Boot Time

The package distributions of Firebird either install a script which starts the database at boot time and stops it at shutdown time or use systemd. In this case, make sure to update the init script with the new sysdba password, if necessary.

If you compiled from source, you'll need to install a script like one of the following to start/stop the database at boot/shutdown time.

For Firebird versions 2.5 and up, use the following script:

```

#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
  start)
        su -l firebird "/opt/firebird/bin/fbguard -pidfile /tmp/firebird.pid -daemon -forever"
        ;;
  stop)
        su -l firebird "kill `cat /tmp/firebird.pid`"
        ;;
  *)
        echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        exit 1
esac

exit 0

```

For Firebird version 1.5 to 2.1, use the following script:

```

#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
  start)
        su -l firebird "/opt/firebird/bin/fbmgr -start -forever"
        ;;
  stop)
        su -l firebird "/opt/firebird/bin/fbmgr -shut -user sysdba -password Passw0rd"
        ;;
  *)
        echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        exit 1
esac

exit 0

```

For Firebird prior to version 1.5, use the following script:

```

#!/bin/sh

case "$1" in
  start)
        /opt/interbase/bin/ibmgr -start
        ;;
  stop)
        /opt/interbase/bin/ibmgr -shut -user sysdba -password Passw0rd
        ;;
  *)
        echo $"Usage: $0 {start|stop}"
        exit 1
esac

exit 0

```

Install this script and run it with the "start" option to start up the database. Running it with the "stop" option shuts the database down. To access a database, it must be running.

Note that the /etc/hosts.equiv file must contain an entry for localhost and possibly localhost.localdomain for the database to start properly and for the "local" tools such as *ibmgr*/*fbmgr* to function.

### Creating a Database

Firebird should now be ready to use, but to do any useful work, you'll have to create a database.

Though you can create tables in the *isc4.gdb* database using the SYSDBA user, it's not a good idea. You should create a new database using a regular user. The following sequence of commands creates a database.

For Firebird version 1.5 or higher, these commands create a database called */opt/firebird/testdb.gdb* which is owned by *testuser*.

```

[user@localhost user]$ isql -u testuser -p testpassword
Use CONNECT or CREATE DATABASE to specify a database
SQL> create database '/opt/firebird/testdb.gdb';
SQL> quit;

```

For Firebird prior to version 1.5, these commands create a database called */opt/interbase/testdb.gdb* which is owned by *testuser*.

```

[user@localhost user]$ isql -u testuser -p testpassword
Use CONNECT or CREATE DATABASE to specify a database
SQL> create database '/opt/interbase/testdb.gdb';
SQL> quit;

```

Firebird databases are referenced by the pathname of the database file. If you try to create a database using a file name that already exists or if you forget to enclose the file name in single quotes, you'll get a cryptic error indicating that the 'database' token is unknown. So, if you get a message like that, make sure that you enclosed the file name in single quotes and make sure that the database file that you're trying to create doesn't already exist.

Now you can log into the database as *testuser*.

Use the following command for Firebird 1.5 or higher.

```
isql -u testuser -p testpassword /opt/firebird/testdb.gdb
```

Use the following command for Firebird prior to version 1.5.

```
isql -u testuser -p testpassword /opt/interbase/testdb.gdb
```

The only users that can drop a database are the user that owns the database and the *SYSDBA* user. If you want to drop the database, you can do so using *isql* as follows for Firebird version 1.5 or higher...

```

[user@localhost user]$ isql -u testuser -p testpassword /opt/firebird/testdb.gdb
Database:  /opt/firebird/testdb.gdb, User: testuser
SQL> drop database;
SQL> quit;

```

Or as follows for Firebird prior to version 1.5.

```

[user@localhost user]$ isql -u testuser -p testpassword /opt/interbase/testdb.gdb
Database:  /opt/interbase/testdb.gdb, User: testuser
SQL> drop database;
SQL> quit;

```

To delete a user, use the *gsec* utility as the root user and delete the appropriate user as follows for Firebird version 1.5 or higher.

```

[root@localhost root]# cd /opt/firebird
[root@localhost firebird]# ls -l isc4.gdb
-rw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       626688 Feb 18 20:43 isc4.gdb
[root@localhost firebird]# /opt/firebird/bin/gsec
GSEC> delete testuser
GSEC> quit

```

Or as follows for Firebird prior to version 1.5.

```

[root@localhost root]# cd /opt/interbase
[root@localhost interbase]# ls -l isc4.gdb
-rw-rw-rw-    1 root     root       626688 Feb 18 20:43 isc4.gdb
[root@localhost interbase]# /opt/interbase/bin/gsec
GSEC> delete testuser
GSEC> quit

```

This should be enough to get you started. To set up more complex configurations, consult the [Firebird documentation](http://firebird.sourceforge.net/index.php?op=doc).

### Accessing a Database

To access a database called */opt/firebird/testdb.gdb* on the local machine as the *testuser* user with password *testpassword*, use the following command.

```
isql -u testuser -p testpassword /opt/firebird/testdb.gdb
```

To connect to a database on a remote machine, prepend the database filename with the remote hostname, followed by a colon. For example, to access a database called */opt/firebird/testdb.gdb* on the remote machine *testhost* as the *testuser* user with password *testpassword*, use the following command.

```
isql -u testuser -p testpassword testhost:/opt/firebird/testdb.gdb
```

Once you're connected to the database, the isql client prompts you to enter a query. Queries may be split across multiple lines. To run a query, end it with a semicolon. To exit, type quit;.

A sample *isql* session follows.

```

[user@localhost user]$ isql -u testuser -p testpass /opt/firebird/testdb.gdb
Database:  /opt/firebird/testdb.gdb, User: testuser
SQL> create table testtable (
CON> col1 char(40),

COL2                            INTEGER Nullable
SQL> insert into testtable values ('hello',50);
SQL> insert into testtable values ('hi',60);
SQL> insert into testtable values ('bye',70);
SQL> select * from testtable;

bye                                                70

SQL> delete from testtable where col2=50;
SQL> select * from testtable;

SQL> commit;
SQL> drop table testtable;
SQL> quit;

```
### Firebird Quirks

In most databases, you can create, alter or drop databse objects such as tables, indices or stored procedures at will. In Firebird, you should create, alter or drop databse objects when you have exclusive access to the databse.

Basically, you should shut down all clients, use isql to create, alter or drop the objects, then start the clients again. If you don't do this, you'll get confusing results.
