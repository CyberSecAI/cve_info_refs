Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-29901:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from non-transparent sharing of branch predictor targets between different contexts (e.g., user and kernel) in certain Intel processors.
*   This allows an attacker to potentially influence the CPU's speculative execution behavior.
*   Specifically, the issue lies in how return instructions are handled in the branch predictor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Speculative Execution Vulnerability (Retbleed):** The core vulnerability is related to speculative execution, where the processor speculatively executes instructions based on predictions. This can lead to data leaks if the prediction is incorrect.
*   **Bypass of Retpoline Mitigation:** This specific flaw can bypass the "retpoline" mitigation, a software-based defense mechanism designed to protect against Spectre-v2 vulnerabilities. The retpoline mitigation was designed to protect against arbitrary speculative code execution, but the Retbleed vulnerability can bypass it.
*   **Return Instruction Hijacking:** An attacker can manipulate return instructions to perform arbitrary speculative code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from the kernel's memory. This information could include passwords, encryption keys, or other confidential data.
*   **Arbitrary Speculative Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector is local access, meaning the attacker must have the ability to execute code on the affected system.
*   **Hijacking Return Instructions:** The attacker exploits the processor's branch predictor by manipulating return instructions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** An attacker with low-level user access is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.
*  **Local Network:** Attacks can be launched from the local network.

**Affected Hardware:**

*   Intel microprocessor generations 6 (Skylake - 2015) to 8 (Coffee Lake - 2017).

**Mitigation:**
*   Intel recommends using Enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS).
*   Software based solutions like retpoline also helps in mitigating speculative attacks.
*   AMD introduced Jmp2Ret to address this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability is a variant of the Spectre family of speculative execution vulnerabilities, specifically related to return instructions.
*   Exploitation can occur due to a lack of proper isolation of branch predictor state between different contexts.
*  Proof of concept attacks are available, indicating real-world exploitability.
