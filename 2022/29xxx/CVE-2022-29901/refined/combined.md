# Retbleed: Intel and AMD Processors Information Disclosure Vulnerability. Patch Now!

* Post author:[Arpit K](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/arpit-kataria/ "Posts by Arpit K")
* Post published:July 18, 2022
* Reading time:4 mins read

Researchers have discovered a new **[Speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution)** attack called Retbleed, which affects both Intel and AMD processors that can result in **information disclosure** vulnerability. [**CVE-2022-29900**](https://scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-29900) (AMD) is the tracking identifier for AMD, while [**CVE**](https://scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-29901)[**-2022-29901**](https://scaprepo.com/view.jsp?id=CVE-2022-29900) (Intel) is the tracking identifier for Intel. By using a [vulnerability management tool](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/), we can obtain the active exploitation of this vulnerability. However, the new Spectre version (Speculative execution attack) can get through the kernel’s retpoline mitigation and leak unfair data. Reptoline manages how the CPU performs assume when “jmp” and “call” are executed. Under specific microarchitecture-dependent circumstances, an attacker with poor user access can hijack return instructions to perform arbitrary speculative code execution.

Attacks can exploit this vulnerability when launching an attack from the local network, as proofs of concepts (POCs) are available. The vulnerability is called **“Retbleed.”** Retpoline made available a software-based solution. Intel has published a security **[bulletin](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00702.html)**. AMD has also published a security **[advisory](https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037)**. [Patch management software](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/) can be a great way to mitigate this vulnerability.

---

## Exploitation Details of Retbleed

Retbleed attempts to hijack a return instruction in the kernel to execute arbitrary speculative [code](https://www.secpod.com/topics/reviews/fun-tool-for-it-admin-2/) in the kernel context. The attacker can leak any kernel data if they have enough control over registers and memory at the victim’s return instruction.

The attackers’ basic idea is to force statements to be predicted as indirect branches, thus bypassing Retpoline’s protections. They consider return instructions as an attack channel for speculation execution.

---

## Retbleed Affected Versions

* AMD microprocessor families 15h to 18h.
* Intel microprocessor generations 6 (Skylake – 2015) to 8 (Coffee Lake – 2017).

---

## Solution

* **AMD introduced Jmp2Ret** to address this vulnerability.

> A software-based solution called Jmp2Ret prevents an attacker-controlled BTB entry from ever being used to forecast privileged “ret” instructions, which lessens the risk of BTC-RET.

* Intel advises utilizing enhanced Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) to address the potential issue, even though Retpoline has fixed this issue.

> IBRS is pre-installed on Windows systems, thus an update is not necessary.

* Retpoline has introduced a software-based solution to defend against speculative execution threats by isolating indirect branches via return operations.

---

We strongly recommend deploying security updates to [patch](https://www.secpod.com/topics/reviews/great-endpoint-security-platform/) these vulnerabilities at the earliest.
Use [SanerNow](https://www.secpod.com/sanernow-platform/) and keep your systems updated and secure.

 Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-23816,CVE-2022-23825,CVE-2022-29900 / XSA-407

   Retbleed - arbitrary speculative code execution with return instructions

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Researchers at ETH Zurich have discovered Retbleed, allowing for
arbitrary speculative execution in a victim context.

For more details, see:
  <https://comsec.ethz.ch/retbleed>

ETH Zurich have allocated CVE-2022-29900 for AMD and CVE-2022-29901 for
Intel.

Despite the similar preconditions, these are very different
microarchitectural behaviours between vendors.

On AMD CPUs, Retbleed is one specific instance of a more general
microarchitectural behaviour called Branch Type Confusion.  AMD have
assigned CVE-2022-23816 (Retbleed) and CVE-2022-23825 (Branch Type
Confusion).

For more details, see:
  <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037>

On Intel CPUs, Retbleed is not a new vulnerability; it is only
applicable to software which did not follow Intel's original Spectre-v2
guidance.  Intel are using the ETH Zurich allocated CVE-2022-29901.

For more details, see:
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00702.html>
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>

ARM have indicated existing guidance on Spectre-v2 is sufficient.

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host
memory, including memory assigned to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Whether a CPU is potentially vulnerable depends on its
microarchitecture.  Consult your hardware vendor.

For ARM and Intel CPUs, Xen implemented the vendor-recommended defaults
in XSA-254 and follow-on fixes.  Therefore, the Xen Security Team
believes there are no further changes necessary on these CPUs.
Administrators who deviated from the default mitigations are potentially
affected and should re-evaluate their threat model.

For AMD, CPUs from the Zen2 microarchitecture and earlier are
potentially vulnerable.  Zen3 and later CPUs are not believed to be
vulnerable.

The patches for Xen implement the IBPB-at-entry mitigation.  This
depends on the IBPB microcode distributed by AMD in 2018 as part of the
original Spectre/Meltdown work.  Consult your dom0 OS vendor.

In addition to IBPB, "cross thread" safety is necessary.  On Zen2 CPUs,
Xen uses STIBP by default.  On Zen1 CPUs, SMT needs disabling either in
the firmware, or by passing `smt=0` on Xen's command line.  On Fam15h
CPUs, Cluster Multi-Threading needs disabling in firmware.

Due to performance concerns, dom0 is excluded from IBPB-on-entry
protections by default.  This is because PV dom0 is trusted in most
deployments.  If your threat model model doesn't allow for dom0 to be
treated specially, boot with `spec-ctrl=ibpb-entry` which will cause
IBPB-on-entry protections to be applied to dom0 too.

MITIGATION
==========

There are no mitigations.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

For the 4.15 and 4.16 branches in particular, these patches depend on:

 - x86/spec-ctrl: Only adjust MSR_SPEC_CTRL for idle with legacy IBRS
 - x86/spec-ctrl: Knobs for STIBP and PSFD, and follow hardware STIBP hint
 - xen/cmdline: Extend parse_boolean() to signal a name match
 - x86/spec-ctrl: Add fine-grained cmdline suboptions for primitives

which have been recently backported.

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20221007-0007
**Version:**
2.0

**Last updated:**
04/25/2024

**Status:**
Interim.

**CVEs:** CVE-2022-29901

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Intel chipsets and processors. Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access. Refer to the vendor advisory INTEL-SA-00702 for specific version details.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.

StorageGRID:

StorageGRID (formerly StorageGRID Webscale) does not provide mechanisms for running unprivileged third-party code and is not affected. For virtualized deployments, NetApp recommends working with your hypervisor and cloud platform vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform. For Docker-based deployments, NetApp recommends working with your operating system and hardware vendors to ensure that your NetApp product is running on a secure and patched platform.

/sigh

AMD changed the CVE in the bulletin between the final draft, and what
went public.

CVE-2022-23816 has been referenced by multiple other vendors too, so is
definitely out in the world.  Hopefully MITRE will close out one of
CVE-2022-23816 and CVE-2022-29900 as a dup of the other.

For now, I think the least confusing option is to keep both referenced.

Is it confirmed that AMD is not using CVE-2022-29900? The above
amd-sb-1037 references as well both CVE-2022-23825 (Branch Type
Confusion) and CVE-2022-29900 (RETbleed), so I assume they agreed to
use CVE-2022-29900 for retbleed?

So should the Xen advisory as well use CVE-2022-23825,CVE-2022-29900
and CVE-2022-29901?

Regards,
Salvatore

Package        : linux-5.10
Version        : 5.10.136-1~deb10u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-2585 CVE-2022-2586 CVE-2022-2588 CVE-2022-26373
                 CVE-2022-29900 CVE-2022-29901 CVE-2022-36879 CVE-2022-36946

Linux 5.10 has been packaged for Debian 10 as linux-5.10.  This
provides a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use
kernel packages from the "buster-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 4.19, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

The "apt full-upgrade" command will *not* automatically install the
updated kernel packages.  You should explicitly install one of the
following metapackages first, as appropriate for your system:

    linux-image-5.10-686
    linux-image-5.10-686-pae
    linux-image-5.10-amd64
    linux-image-5.10-arm64
    linux-image-5.10-armmp
    linux-image-5.10-armmp-lpae
    linux-image-5.10-cloud-amd64
    linux-image-5.10-cloud-arm64
    linux-image-5.10-rt-686-pae
    linux-image-5.10-rt-amd64
    linux-image-5.10-rt-arm64
    linux-image-5.10-rt-armmp

For example, if the command "uname -r" currently shows
"5.10.0-0.deb10.16-amd64", you should install linux-image-5.10-amd64.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    bpftool hyperv-daemons libcpupower-dev libcpupower1
    linux-compiler-gcc-8-arm linux-compiler-gcc-8-x86 linux-cpupower
    linux-libc-dev usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from the linux source
package in Debian 10.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2585

    A use-after-free flaw in the implementation of POSIX CPU timers
    may result in denial of service or in local privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2586

    A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
    privilege escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    in any user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2588

    Zhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls_route
    filter implementation which may result in local privilege
    escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any
    user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-26373

    It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
    Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
    are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
    which may result in information disclosure.

    Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>

CVE-2022-29900

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for AMD/Hygon
    processors, mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions
    may allow arbitrary speculative code execution under certain
    microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    A list of affected AMD CPU types can be found at
    <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037>

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel
    processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against
    speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in
    some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code
    execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    More information can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>

CVE-2022-36879

    A flaw was discovered in xfrm_expand_policies in the xfrm
    subsystem which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.

CVE-2022-36946

    Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
    corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
    denial of service.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.10.136-1~deb10u3. This update additionally includes many more bug
fixes from stable updates 5.10.128-5.10.136 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-5.10 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-5.10 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-5.10>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Nevermind, I missunderstood the wording and the advisory just mentions
all the related CVEs correctly and made a thinko. It might turn out
that CVE-2022-23816 will not be used, but then the title would read
only as

Xen Security Advisory CVE-2022-23825,CVE-2022-29900 / XSA-407

So please disregard the question above.

Salvatore

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2585

    A use-after-free flaw in the implementation of POSIX CPU timers may
    result in denial of service or in local privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-2586

    A use-after-free in the Netfilter subsystem may result in local
    privilege escalation for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in
    any user or network namespace.

CVE-2022-2588

    Zhenpeng Lin discovered a use-after-free flaw in the cls_route
    filter implementation which may result in local privilege escalation
    for a user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user or network
    namespace.

CVE-2022-26373

    It was discovered that on certain processors with Intel's Enhanced
    Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (eIBRS) capabilities there
    are exceptions to the documented properties in some situations,
    which may result in information disclosure.

    Intel's explanation of the issue can be found at
    <<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/post-barrier-return-stack-buffer-predictions.html>>

CVE-2022-29900

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for AMD/Hygon
    processors, mis-trained branch predictions for return instructions
    may allow arbitrary speculative code execution under certain
    microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    A list of affected AMD CPU types can be found at
    <<https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1037>>

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel processors
    (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against speculative
    branch target injection attacks were insufficient in some
    circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code execution
    under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    More information can be found at
    <<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>>

CVE-2022-36879

    A flaw was discovered in xfrm_expand_policies in the xfrm subsystem
    which can cause a reference count to be dropped twice.

CVE-2022-36946

    Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera reported a memory
    corruption flaw in the Netfilter subsystem which may result in
    denial of service.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.10.136-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

                 CVE-2022-42895 CVE-2022-42896 CVE-2022-43750

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2022-2978

    "butt3rflyh4ck", Hao Sun, and Jiacheng Xu reported a flaw in the
    nilfs2 filesystem driver which can lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local use might be able to exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3521

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the KCM subsystem
    which could lead to a crash.

    This subsystem is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2022-3524

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the IPv6 stack which
    could lead to a memory leak.  A local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3564

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3565

    A flaw was discovered in the mISDN driver which would lead to a
    use-after-free.  This might be exploitable to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2022-3594

    Andrew Gaul reported that the r8152 Ethernet driver would log
    excessive numbers of messages in response to network errors.  A
    remote attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3621, CVE-2022-3646

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a null pointer dereference or memory leak.  A user
    permitted to mount arbitrary filesystem images could use these to
    cause a denial of service (crash or resource exhaustion).

CVE-2022-3628

    Dokyung Song, Jisoo Jang, and Minsuk Kang reported a potential
    heap-based buffer overflow in the brcmfmac Wi-Fi driver.  A user
    able to connect a malicious USB device could exploit this to cause
    a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3640

    A flaw was discovered in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem which
    would lead to a use-after-free.  This might be exploitable
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-3643 (XSA-423)

    A flaw was discovered in the Xen network backend driver that would
    result in it generating malformed packet buffers.  If these
    packets were forwarded to certain other network devices, a Xen
    guest could exploit this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    device reset).

CVE-2022-3649

    The syzbot tool found flaws in the nilfs2 filesystem driver which
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount arbitrary
    filesystem images could use these to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-4378

    Kyle Zeng found a flaw in procfs that would cause a stack-based
    buffer overflow.  A local user permitted to write to a sysctl
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-20369

    A flaw was found in the v4l2-mem2mem media driver that would lead
    to an out-of-bounds write.  A local user with access to such a
    device could exploit this for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-29901

    Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi reported that for Intel
    processors (Intel Core generation 6, 7 and 8), protections against
    speculative branch target injection attacks were insufficient in
    some circumstances, which may allow arbitrary speculative code
    execution under certain microarchitecture-dependent conditions.

    More information can be found at
    <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html>

CVE-2022-40768

    "hdthky" reported that the stex SCSI adapter driver did not fully
    initialise a structure that is copied to user-space.  A local user
    with access to such a device could exploit this to leak sensitive
    information.

CVE-2022-41849

    A race condition was discovered in the smscufx graphics driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A user able to remove the
    physical device while also accessing its device node could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-41850

    A race condition was discovered in the hid-roccat input driver,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user able to access
    such a device could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-42328, CVE-2022-42329 (XSA-424)

    Yang Yingliang reported that the Xen network backend driver did
    not use the proper function to free packet buffers in one case,
    which could lead to a deadlock.  A Xen guest could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (hang).

CVE-2022-42895

    Tamás Koczka reported a flaw in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem
    that would result in reading uninitialised memory.  A nearby
    attacker able to make a Bluetooth connection could exploit
    this to leak sensitive information.

CVE-2022-42896

    Tamás Koczka reported flaws in the Bluetooh L2CAP subsystem that
    can lead to a use-after-free.  A nearby attacker able to make a
    Bluetooth SMP connection could exploit this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2022-43750

    The syzbot tool found that the USB monitor (usbmon) driver allowed
    user-space programs to overwrite the driver's data structures.  A
    local user permitted to access a USB monitor device could exploit
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  However, by default only the
    root user can access such devices.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.269-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

Computer optimization technique

**Speculative execution** is an [optimization](/wiki/Optimization_%28computer_science%29 "Optimization (computer science)") technique where a [computer system](/wiki/Computer_system "Computer system") performs some task that may not be needed. Work is done before it is known whether it is actually needed, so as to prevent a delay that would have to be incurred by doing the work after it is known that it is needed. If it turns out the work was not needed after all, most changes made by the work are reverted and the results are ignored.

The objective is to provide more [concurrency](/wiki/Concurrency_%28computer_science%29 "Concurrency (computer science)") if extra [resources](/wiki/Resource_%28computer_science%29 "Resource (computer science)") are available. This approach is employed in a variety of areas, including [branch prediction](/wiki/Branch_predictor "Branch predictor") in [pipelined](/wiki/Instruction_pipeline "Instruction pipeline") [processors](/wiki/CPU "CPU"), value prediction for exploiting value locality, prefetching [memory](/wiki/Instruction_prefetch "Instruction prefetch") and [files](/wiki/File_system "File system"), and [optimistic concurrency control](/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control "Optimistic concurrency control") in [database systems](/wiki/Relational_database_management_system "Relational database management system").[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-DivisionRaghavan1998-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3)

[Speculative multithreading](/wiki/Speculative_multithreading "Speculative multithreading") is a special case of speculative execution.

## Overview

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")]

Modern [pipelined](/wiki/Instruction_pipeline "Instruction pipeline") [microprocessors](/wiki/Microprocessor "Microprocessor") use speculative execution to reduce the cost of [conditional branch](/wiki/Conditional_branch "Conditional branch") instructions using schemes that predict the execution path of a program based on the history of branch executions.[[2]](#cite_note-DivisionRaghavan1998-2) In order to improve performance and utilization of computer resources, instructions can be scheduled at a time when it has not yet been determined that the instructions will need to be executed, ahead of a [branch](/wiki/Branch_predictor "Branch predictor").[[4]](#cite_note-Krieg-Brückner1992-4)

## Variants

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Variants")]

*Speculative computation* was a related earlier concept.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

### Eager execution

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Eager execution")]
See also: [Eager evaluation](/wiki/Eager_evaluation "Eager evaluation")

Eager execution is a form of speculative execution where both sides of the conditional branch are executed; however, the results are committed only if the predicate is true. With unlimited resources, eager execution (also known as *oracle execution*) would in theory provide the same performance as perfect [branch prediction](/wiki/Branch_prediction "Branch prediction"). With limited resources, eager execution should be employed carefully, since the number of resources needed grows [exponentially](/wiki/Exponential_growth "Exponential growth") with each level of branch executed eagerly.[[6]](#cite_note-ŠilcRobič1999-6)

### Predictive execution

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Predictive execution")]
See also: [Pipeline (computing)](/wiki/Pipeline_%28computing%29 "Pipeline (computing)")
Main article: [Branch predictor](/wiki/Branch_predictor "Branch predictor")

Predictive execution is a form of speculative execution where some outcome is predicted and execution proceeds along the predicted path until the actual result is known. If the prediction is true, the predicted execution is allowed to commit; however, if there is a misprediction, execution has to be unrolled and re-executed. Common forms of this include [branch predictors](/wiki/Branch_predictor "Branch predictor") and [memory dependence prediction](/wiki/Memory_dependence_prediction "Memory dependence prediction"). A generalized form is sometimes referred to as value prediction.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

### Runahead

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Runahead")]
This paragraph is an excerpt from [Runahead](/wiki/Runahead "Runahead").[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Runahead&action=edit)]
[Runahead](/wiki/Runahead "Runahead") is a technique that allows a [computer processor](/wiki/Processor_%28computing%29 "Processor (computing)") to speculatively pre-process [instructions](/wiki/Instruction_%28computer_science%29 "Instruction (computer science)") during [cache](/wiki/CPU_cache "CPU cache") miss cycles. The pre-processed instructions are used to generate instruction and [data stream](/wiki/Data_stream "Data stream") [prefetches](/wiki/Instruction_prefetch "Instruction prefetch") by executing instructions leading to [cache misses](/wiki/Cache_misses "Cache misses") (typically called *long latency loads*) before they would normally occur, effectively hiding [memory latency](/wiki/Memory_latency "Memory latency"). In runahead, the processor uses the idle execution resources to calculate instruction and data stream addresses using the available information that is independent of a cache miss. Once the processor has resolved the initial cache miss, all runahead results are discarded, and the processor resumes execution as normal. The primary use case of the technique is to mitigate the effects of the [memory wall](/wiki/Memory_wall "Memory wall"). The technique may also be used for other purposes, such as pre-computing branch outcomes to achieve highly accurate [branch prediction](/wiki/Branch_predictor "Branch predictor").[[8]](#cite_note-8)

### Lazy execution

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Lazy execution")]
Main article: [Lazy evaluation](/wiki/Lazy_evaluation "Lazy evaluation")

Lazy execution is the opposite of eager execution, and does not involve speculation. The incorporation of speculative execution into implementations of the [Haskell programming language](/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29 "Haskell (programming language)"), a lazy language, is a current research topic. [Eager Haskell](/wiki/Eager_Haskell "Eager Haskell"), a variant of the language, is designed around the idea of speculative execution. A 2003 PhD thesis made [GHC](/wiki/Glasgow_Haskell_Compiler "Glasgow Haskell Compiler") support a kind of speculative execution with an abortion mechanism to back out in case of a bad choice called *optimistic execution*.[[9]](#cite_note-Robert_Ennals_and_Simon_Peyton_Jones-9) It was deemed too complicated.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

## Security vulnerabilities

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Speculative_execution&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Security vulnerabilities")]
See also: [Speculative execution CPU vulnerabilities](/wiki/Speculative_execution_CPU_vulnerabilities "Speculative execution CPU vulnerabilities")

Starting in 2017, a series of [security vulnerabilities](/wiki/Vulnerability_%28computing%29 "Vulnerability (computing)") were found in the implementations of speculative execution on common processor architectures which effectively enabled an elevation of [privileges](/wiki/Privilege_%28computing%29 "Privilege (computing)").

These include:

* [Foreshadow](/wiki/Foreshadow_%28security_vulnerability%29 "Foreshadow (security vulnerability)")
* [Meltdown](/wiki/Meltdown_%28security_vulnerability%29 "Meltdown (security vulnerability)")

### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in some Intel® Processors may allow information disclosure.Intel is releasing prescriptive guidance to address this potential vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID:  [CVE-2022-29901](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29901)

Description: Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor targets between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score:  4.7 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

### Affected Products:

Some Intel® Processors, consult this list of affected products [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html).

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends that affected Intel® Processors use Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) instead of ‘retpoline’ to address this potential vulnerability.  Intel is releasing a [technical paper](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html "https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/return-stack-buffer-underflow.html") to describe the Return Stack Buffer Underflow recommendation.

Intel has worked with operating system vendors to develop software updates to address this potential vulnerability.

Intel has worked with the Linux community to make this option available to all Linux users. Systems administrators and end users should check with their Linux vendor to determine the status of the operating system fix.

Windows operating system uses IBRS by default, so no update is required.

Previously ‘retpoline’ and IBRS are described as part of the technical paper listed here:

<https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/retpoline-branch-target-injection-mitigation.html>

### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Johannes Wikner and Kaveh Razavi from the COMSEC group at ETH Zurich for reporting this issue.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
