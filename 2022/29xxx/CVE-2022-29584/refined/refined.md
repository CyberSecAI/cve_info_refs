Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization in the 'External media' block of Mahara. Specifically, the application fails to properly strip or encode malicious JavaScript code within the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag when the `embedly-card` CSS class is present.  This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. The injected malicious JavaScript is stored within the Mahara application (e.g. within the 'External media' block) and executed when a user views the affected content.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the input provided for the `href` attribute in the ‘External Media’ block, allowing "javascript:" URIs to be used.
- **Lack of Encoding:** The application does not correctly encode special characters or remove script tags, causing JavaScript code to be interpreted by the browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Account Takeover:** The provided exploit examples demonstrate how an attacker could potentially create a new admin user or perform other privileged actions on the victim's behalf.
- **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Attackers could potentially use the XSS vulnerability to steal cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data, or manipulate information displayed in the application.
- **Phishing/Social Engineering:** The attacker could redirect users to a malicious site or perform actions that appear to originate from the legitimate application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is via the 'External media' block by injecting malicious HTML code that includes the `embedly-card` class.
- The vulnerability is also present wherever HTML code can be entered, such as text blocks, notes, journal entries, and forum posts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to add or edit content within Mahara, such as by creating or modifying an 'External media' block or other HTML content field.
- No specific technical expertise seems necessary beyond knowing how to inject an HTML link with a 'javascript:' href.

**Additional Details:**

- The `embedly-card` CSS class plays a key role in triggering the vulnerability. When this class is present, the application's handling of the `href` attribute seems to bypass the sanitization mechanisms that might be in place for other types of input.
- The provided exploit examples show how to open a new window to the user add page and fill in the form fields.
- The suggested fix involves sanitizing the URL or performing sanity checks in the embed service file.
- Affected versions include Mahara versions before 20.10.5, 21.04.4, 21.10.2, and 22.04.0.
