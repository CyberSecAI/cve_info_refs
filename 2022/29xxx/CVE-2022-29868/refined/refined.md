- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic bug in 1Password for Mac allowed a malicious local program to bypass validations when communicating with other processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Insufficient validation of inter-process communication, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious program can read vault items and obtain derived values (account unlock key and SRP-related values) used to sign in to 1Password.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious program needs to be running locally on the same computer as an unlocked instance of 1Password for Mac.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary code on the target machine.
