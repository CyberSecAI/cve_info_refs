Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `sys_User.php_level_del` function when deleting members within the Cscms music portal system. Specifically, the `id[]` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application directly incorporates user-controlled input into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query structure and execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    *   **Blind SQL Injection:** The specific type of SQL injection identified is blind SQL injection. The attacker cannot directly see the results of the SQL queries but can infer information by observing the time it takes for the server to respond, particularly by using `sleep()` function.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *  **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting this SQL injection, an attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as database names, user credentials, and other confidential data.
    *  **Database Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially modify database records, add new malicious entries, or even delete critical data.
    *  **Potential for Complete System Compromise:** Depending on the database configuration and the level of access, successful SQL injection can lead to complete system compromise.
   *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The `sleep()` function in the injection payload can be used to cause a denial of service by causing the server to become unresponsive for a period.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is carried out via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/admin.php/user/level_del` endpoint.
    *   **Malicious Payload:** The core of the attack is the malicious SQL payload injected into the `id[]` parameter of the POST request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the vulnerable functionality, which suggests that exploitation would be internal.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.

*   **Specific Code Details:**
    *   The exploit involves injecting SQL code into the `id[]` parameter, such as `id[]=(sleep(5))` to test for injection and `(case(1)when(ascii(substr((select(database()))from(1)for(1)))=99)then(sleep(5))else(1)end)` to perform database enumeration.
    *   The provided HTTP request demonstrates how the malicious payload is incorporated in the POST data.

This detailed breakdown aligns with the described SQL injection vulnerability.
