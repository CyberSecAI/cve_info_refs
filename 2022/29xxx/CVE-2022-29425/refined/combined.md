They still haven’t updated this plugin to be HPOS compatible, although it is a simple thing to do. Asking them to do anything, even in exchange for payment, is futile.
I think at this stage that I’ll get my own plugin programmed if they don’t update within the next month.
Shame on you!

This plugin was ridiculously east to install and setup, and it is exactly what I was looking for – a file upload for a custom product at checkout. And the Free version is fully functional! WOOT!

This plugin it might be very helpful if, for some reason, you have to let customers upload files during the checkout.

The free version of this plugin is just brilliant! The UI is very easy to understand, making it pretty straightforward to configure.
We needed to have an upload field on the Checkout so customers could attach a PDF file. The file can be included as an actual email attachment, and not just a link. It also has the ability to include the upload field conditionally, meaning you can link it to a specific product on the backend, and it will just show if that product is in cart.
I have tested multiple checkout upload plugins over the last few months. This is HANDS DOWN the BEST plugin of its kind on the market.

The free version of the plugin does much more than other paid plugins do. So many possibilities for customisation.

## Changelog

#### 2.2.0 – 2024-08-28

* NEW: added shortcode ‘wpwham\_checkout\_files\_uploader’.

* FIX: issue with metabox not displaying on admin Order page when “HPOS” enabled.

#### 2.1.5 – 2023-07-13

* FIX: PHP 8.2 notices.

#### 2.1.4 – 2022-06-02

* FIX: add nonce checks to AJAX actions.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

#### 2.1.3 – 2022-05-10

* FIX: escape filenames on order confirmation/thank you pages.

#### 2.1.2 – 2021-12-23

* FIX: potential XSS vulnerability (thanks to Vlad at Patchstack).
* FIX: minor display bug in settings due to WooCommerce update.

#### 2.1.1 – 2021-09-16

* UPDATE: PHP 8 now officially supported.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

#### 2.1.0 – 2021-04-15

* NEW: added more options to “validate image dimensions” setting: “greater than or equal”, and “less than or equal”.
* NEW: added button to delete file attachments on admin “edit order” page. (If you don’t want the ability to delete files, you can use the filter `wpwham_checkout_files_upload_allow_admin_delete_files` to disable it).
* FIX: check if server’s temporary directory is writeable. If not, display an error message. (Solves an issue with 0-byte files being uploaded).
* FIX: bug where sometimes 0-byte files were attached to order emails.
* UPDATE: for text labels/notices, made it possible for a translated string to take precedence over stored settings. (Previously it was the other way around. This should now make things easier if you use a translation plugin like LocoTranslate, Polylang, etc).
* UPDATE: performance improvement — load our admin assets only when needed.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

#### 2.0.4 – 2021-01-12

* FIX: clean output buffer before downloads (solves conflict with some 3rd-party plugins which interfere with the output buffer, causing downloads to appear as empty or corrupt).

#### 2.0.3 – 2020-09-17

* UPDATE: display our settings in WC status report.

#### 2.0.2 – 2020-08-21

* FIX: upload button translation issue (removed old label settings, added new ones).
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

#### 2.0.1 – 2020-06-17

* FIX: issue with upload button not working in certain themes.
* FIX: user permissions issue incorrectly preventing downloading of images from the WP admin side.
* FIX: JS typo.

#### 2.0.0 – 2020-06-11

* NEW: **Breaking Change** the `Form (simple)` template has been removed, and `Form (AJAX)` is now the standard template. `Form (AJAX)` has been the default since v1.4.0 (2018-08-25), so for most people this change will have no effect. However, if you were using `Form (simple)`, or if you had customized either template, please double check your settings to make sure things look correct. Or, you can reset the settings to get a fresh start.
* NEW: **Breaking Change** in template settings, the variable `%field_html%` which previously contained BOTH the field html AND the upload button itself, has been split into separate variables `%field_html%` and `%button_html%`. Your template settings will be updated automatically to reflect this.
* NEW: image thumbnails will be shown by default. The image feature has existed since v1.4.0 (2018-08-25), but some people didn’t realize this and/or didn’t know they needed to add `%image%` into the template to enable it. Now `%image%` is included in the template by default. If you don’t want this, simply edit your template settings and remove the `%image%` variable.
* NEW: show spinner when processing, and prevent checkout form submission before upload is completed.
* UPDATE: change the way we handle sessions — only start them when needed, not on every page load.
* UPDATE: extensive code refactoring.
* UPDATE: updated some styling and text. For example, progress bars (if enabled) are now green.
* UPDATE: updated .pot file for translations.

#### 1.5.4 – 2020-01-14

* UPDATE: add new filters ‘wpw\_checkout\_files\_upload\_form\_html’ and ‘wpw\_checkout\_files\_upload\_form\_ajax\_html’.
* UPDATE: wrap checkout page file upload controls in

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
