Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29909:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles Feature Policy inheritance in nested browsing contexts. Specifically, when a document is embedded using elements other than `<iframe>` (like `<embed>` or `<object>`), the document's feature policy was not correctly inherited from the parent context. This caused the embedded document to use its origin's default Feature Policy instead of the intended inherited one.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Incorrect Feature Policy Inheritance:**  The primary weakness is that `HTMLEmbedElement` and `HTMLObjectElement` didn't properly inherit Feature Policy from their parent contexts.
- **Bypassed Permissions:** By not inheriting the correct Feature Policy, a cross-origin document embedded with `<embed>` or `<object>` could bypass the permission prompt and inherit permissions granted to the top-level origin. This allowed the embedded content to act as if it had the top-level context's permission state.
- **Lack of FeaturePolicy Getter for embed/object**: Unlike `iframe`, `embed` and `object` elements did not have a `FeaturePolicy` getter.
- **Faulty Feature Policy Check:** The permission checks are ultimately performed against the top-level origin, which means that a nested cross-origin document could use permissions as if it was the top-level origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:**  A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability to obtain elevated permissions (e.g., microphone, camera, geolocation) that were not explicitly granted to the embedded cross-origin content.
- **Spoofing:** Attackers can potentially spoof the origin of permission requests, making it seem like the top-level site is requesting the permission when it is actually a nested, cross-origin frame. This could trick users into granting sensitive permissions.
- **Data Access**: The nested content can gain access to resources it should not have access to (microphone, camera, geolocation data).

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **Cross-origin Embedding:**  An attacker would embed a malicious page in a legitimate website using `<embed>` or `<object>`.
2.  **Nested Context:**  The embedded content must be loaded in a nested browsing context to exploit the incorrect Feature Policy inheritance. The nesting can be achieved by having a top-level frame loading an iframe, and then using `embed` or `object` in the iframe.
3.  **Permission Request:** The attacker's embedded script requests access to permission-protected APIs (e.g., microphone).
4.  **Bypass:** Due to incorrect Feature Policy inheritance, the attacker bypasses permission prompts and inherits the top-level origin's permissions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to embed content into a website using elements like `<embed>` or `<object>`.
- The attacker must have a cross-origin context compared to the top-level document.
- The attack needs a website where a user already granted permissions to a feature controlled via Feature Policy.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that `HTMLEmbedElement` and `HTMLObjectElement` properly inherit Feature Policy and participate in the feature delegation process.
- The fix involved adding a `FeaturePolicy`-member, getter, and initialization to  `HTMLEmbedElement` and `HTMLObjectElement` as well as modifying `Document::GetParentFeaturePolicy()`.
- The vulnerability was present in Firefox and Thunderbird and fixed in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9 and Thunderbird 91.9 respectively.
- The bug report includes a proof of concept illustrating the vulnerability.
- The exploit is considered easy to construct based on the patch, as there was a test case available.
- The severity of this issue is rated as high.
