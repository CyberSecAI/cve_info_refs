Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-29173.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `go-tuf` client did not correctly implement the client workflow for updating metadata files for roles other than the root role. Specifically, checks for rollback attacks were not implemented correctly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. The client did not consider previously trusted metadata content before updating roles other than the root role. This led to version verification being done against a default zero value.
2. For timestamp and snapshot roles, the client saved metadata files as trusted before verifying if the version of the metafiles they refer to was correct.
3. Missing check for target file removal in the new snapshot metadata.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could cause clients to install software older than what the client previously knew was available, potentially including software with known vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack involves manipulating the metadata files to downgrade the client to older versions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the metadata files that the client downloads.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects `go-tuf` version v0.2.0.
- The fix is available in version v0.3.0 or newer.
- The vulnerability is related to the TUF specification v.1.0.28, specifically section 5.
- The commit `ed6788e` resolves the vulnerability.
- The affected codebase is `go-tuf@f0c3294f63b9145029464164f9bce49553b77cbb`.
