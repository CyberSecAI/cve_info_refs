Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29008

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR). The application uses the `viewid` parameter in the URL to access bus pass details directly, without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application directly uses user-supplied input (`viewid`) to access data, without verifying if the user is authorized to access the requested data. This allows an attacker to potentially access the information of other users by simply changing the `viewid` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can access sensitive information related to other user's bus passes. This may include personal details, travel information, and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the following URL: `http://localhost/buspassms/admin/view-pass-detail.php?viewid=[change id]`
- An attacker can modify the `viewid` parameter in the URL to access bus pass details of different users, potentially enumerating valid `viewid` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the web application, specifically the vulnerable endpoint `/buspassms/admin/view-pass-detail.php`.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to access other user's pass details.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected product is Bus Pass Management System v1.0.
- The vulnerability is present in the `view-pass-detail.php` file.
- The exploit has been verified and is available on Exploit-DB (EDB-ID: 50263).
- The application is developed using PHP and MySQL.
