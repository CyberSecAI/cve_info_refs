Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper escaping of HTML and XML content within build logs in Woodpecker, specifically in the `web/src/components/repo/build/BuildLog.vue` component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The lack of output sanitization allows malicious actors to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into build logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By injecting malicious JavaScript into the build logs, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the browser of any user who views the logs.
- **Compromised User Sessions:** Successful XSS attacks can lead to session hijacking, stealing cookies, and potentially accessing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Build Log Output:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript into the build logs. This can be achieved by manipulating the build process, including commands run within the CI pipeline.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to influence build logs:** The attacker needs to be able to inject code that will be output into the build log displayed to users.
- **User Interaction:** The user has to view the malicious build logs in their browser.
