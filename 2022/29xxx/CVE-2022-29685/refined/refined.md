Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the `sys_User.php_level_sort` function, specifically when handling the `xid` parameter in a POST request.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a blind SQL injection. The application directly incorporates the user-provided `xid` value into an SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization, enabling the attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The response does not reveal output from the query directly, making it a blind SQL injection.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
    *   Data exfiltration: The attacker can retrieve sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   Data modification: The attacker can alter or delete data.
    *   Privilege escalation: The attacker could potentially gain administrative access by modifying user accounts.
    *   Complete system compromise: The attacker might be able to use the SQL injection to gain control of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed via an HTTP POST request to `/admin.php/User/level_sort`. The attacker injects SQL code through the `xid` parameter within the POST data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   The attacker does not need prior authentication to inject the SQL payload and thus can achieve pre-auth exploitation.
    *   The attacker needs to craft appropriate SQL injection payloads to interact with the database.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker demonstrates the vulnerability using the following:
*   A basic sleep injection, using `xid[1]=(sleep(5))` in order to prove SQL injection exists.
*   A more complicated `case` statement using `ascii()` and `substr()` to perform blind SQL injection by checking the database name.

**Additional Notes**

* The vulnerability is located in Cscms music portal system v4.2.
* The issue was reported on April 20, 2022.
