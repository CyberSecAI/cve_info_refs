### Local File Inclusion

This could allow a malicious actor to include local files of the target website and show its output onto the screen. Files which store credentials, such as database credentials, could potentially allow complete database takeover depending on the configuration.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

This security issue has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.

![Update to version X or later](https://patchstack.com/database/img/update-checkmark.svg)
### Update to version 1.2 or later.

Update to version 1.2 or later to remove the vulnerability.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I was looking for a really nice and slim counter/countdown plugin but many of the ones listed around WP simply have too much bloat with a variety of extra things I really didn’t need. Gladly, Counter Box is exactly what I needed. No bloat, quite slim, and works fantastically, and it ensures to take care of timezone since our server is set to GMT and we operate in EST. The only feature I’d like to see is to allow custom css within the style section, as that would allow the html and css to cooperate within a single area. However, I liked that all I needed to do was write my own html/css to give the counter the skin fit for the page/site. For anyone looking for a nice and lean countdown plug, this is a good choice. Thanks.

This little plugin solved a very real problem I had with Elementor. I required a days-expended from a set-date counter and this plugin is perfect for the task!

Très bien et très bon support réactif. La version pro offre de nombreuses options.
En juin 2021 la documentation reste un peu faible… mais un mail au support… tout ok.
