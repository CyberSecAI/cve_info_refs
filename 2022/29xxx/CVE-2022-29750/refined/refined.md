- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter of the `delete_service` function within the `Master.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially leak database information, and potentially gain full control of the database server if not properly configured.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP POST request to the `/cms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_service` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint and must have knowledge of the application's structure to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker must be able to access the `/cms/classes/Master.php` endpoint.
