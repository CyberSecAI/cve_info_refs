This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

Very nice plugin. Free version does the work and paid version is not expensive and adds interesting functions. Very customizable : you can build a popup with or without overlay, a banner, a small or big popup… More options in the free version than much others. Thanks to the dev !

i tried some popular ones and guess what – they fail to work in my peculiar website, not to mention some of them are downright horrible in design and function (like – start by registering in our spammy page OR just freezes the whole thing for a few seconds and baaaam a ton of tasteless presets and options of no use).and this one’s just perfect, does what advertised in a most tidy way imaginable. bravo!!!
