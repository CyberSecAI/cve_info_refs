Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29445

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress Popup Box plugin, versions 2.1.2 and earlier, is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion (LFI). The vulnerability is due to a flaw that allows a malicious actor to include local files of the target website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI): The plugin doesn't properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when including files, which allows attackers to manipulate file paths and include arbitrary files from the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive files on the server, potentially including those containing credentials such as database credentials.
- **Potential Database Takeover:** If database credentials are exposed, an attacker could potentially gain complete control over the database, depending on the server's configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the plugin's file inclusion mechanism, likely via a parameter that controls which file gets included.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires administrative privileges on the WordPress site, as stated in the "Required privilege" field in the patchstack.com content.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the file inclusion process in the vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The patchstack.com content notes that this is a low-severity issue and is unlikely to be exploited, although the CVSS score is 6.8, which implies medium severity.
- The issue is resolved in version 2.2 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP Top 10 A1: Injection.
- The WordPress.org content doesn't mention the specific vulnerability, but it does list that version 2.2 fixed "security issues"
