| @trespassing-potato Could it be that you got fooled by your security scanner?  Because if you step into the `m.CreateService(...` call at line 256, you will see that the path is already being escaped by a call to `syscall.EscapeArg()` (see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms880421(v=msdn.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/ms880421%28v%3Dmsdn.10%29?redirectedfrom=MSDN)). |

| Hello! As I mentioned in [#289](https://github.com/kardianos/service/issues/289) I tried to actually reproduce the issue discovered by our vulnerability scanner - but the added service in question (telegraf) does have a fully quoted path.  I apologize, I should have verified before doing anything :) |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
