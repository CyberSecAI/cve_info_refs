cpu/x86/smm: Introduce SMM module loader version 2

```
Xeon-SP Skylake Scalable Processor can have 36 CPU threads (18 cores).
Current coreboot SMM is unable to handle more than ~32 CPU threads.
This patch introduces a version 2 of the SMM module loader which
addresses this problem. Having two versions of the SMM module loader
prevents any issues to current projects. Future Xeon-SP products will
be using this version of the SMM loader.  Subsequent patches will
enable board specific functionality for Xeon-SP.

The reason for moving to version 2 is the state save area begins to
encroach upon the SMI handling code when more than 32 CPU threads are
in the system. This can cause system hangs, reboots, etc. The second
change is related to staggered entry points with simple near jumps. In
the current loader, near jumps will not work because the CPU is jumping
within the same code segment. In version 2, "far" address jumps are
necessary therefore protected mode must be enabled first. The SMM
layout and how the CPUs are staggered are documented in the code.

By making the modifications above, this allows the smm module loader to
expand easily as more CPU threads are added.

TEST=build for Tiogapass platform under OCP mainboard. Enable the
following in Kconfig.
        select CPU_INTEL_COMMON_SMM
        select SOC_INTEL_COMMON_BLOCK_SMM
        select SMM_TSEG
        select HAVE_SMI_HANDLER
        select ACPI_INTEL_HARDWARE_SLEEP_VALUES

Debug console will show all 36 cores relocated. Further tested by
generating SMI's to port 0xb2 using XDP/ITP HW debugger and ensured all
cores entering and exiting SMM properly. In addition, booted to Linux
5.4 kernel and observed no issues during mp init.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | A new version of the SMM loader which accomodates platforms with over 32 CPU |
|  |  | CPU threads. The existing version of SMM loader uses a 64K code/data |
|  |  | segment and only a limited number of CPU threads can fit into one segment |
|  |  | (because of save state, STM, other features, etc). This loader extends beyond |
|  |  | the 64K segment to accomodate additional CPUs and in theory allows as many |
|  |  | CPU threads as possible limited only by SMRAM space and not by 64K. By default |
|  |  | this loader version is disabled. Please see cpu/x86/Kconfig for more info. |
