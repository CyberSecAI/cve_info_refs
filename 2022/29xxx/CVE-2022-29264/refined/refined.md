The provided content describes the introduction of a new version of the System Management Mode (SMM) module loader in coreboot. This new version, designated as version 2, is designed to handle platforms with more than 32 CPU threads, which the original SMM module loader could not handle due to limitations in its 64K code/data segment. This change addresses issues like system hangs and reboots that could occur when the state save area encroached upon SMI handling code with more than 32 CPU threads. The new loader also requires "far" address jumps, which necessitates enabling protected mode first.

While the content describes changes made to address a limitation, it does not describe a vulnerability as defined in CVE. The changes are to ensure proper functionality in systems with a large number of CPU threads and to prevent potential system instability.

Therefore, the content is:
