Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29912:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Firefox and Thunderbird handle requests initiated through reader mode. Specifically, these requests did not properly omit cookies with a `SameSite` attribute when a page in reader mode is reloaded, especially when meta redirects are involved.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SameSite Cookie Bypass:** Reader mode was not correctly enforcing the `SameSite` attribute of cookies. This means that cookies marked with `SameSite=Strict` or `SameSite=Lax`, which should not be sent in cross-site requests, were being included in requests initiated by reader mode.
- **Meta Redirect Handling:** The way reader mode handled meta redirects contributed to the problem. When a page with a meta redirect was opened in reader mode and then reloaded, the subsequent request incorrectly included `SameSite` cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is that it could be used to exploit CSRF vulnerabilities in websites that rely on `SameSite` cookies for protection. An attacker could trick a user into loading a malicious page in reader mode that, upon reload, would send requests with `SameSite` cookies to a target site, potentially performing unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**

1.  **Attacker-controlled page:** An attacker hosts a webpage with a meta redirect to the target site.
2.  **User interaction:** The user navigates to the attacker-controlled page, opens it in reader mode.
3.  **Reload in reader mode:** The user reloads the page within reader mode (or is forced to do so using history manipulation in a new tab/window).
4.  **Cookie leakage:** The reloaded request is sent to the target site, including cookies that should have been restricted by the `SameSite` attribute, effectively bypassing this protection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage.
- The attacker needs to be able to make a user open the attacker-controlled webpage in reader mode and then reload it. This could be done with various social engineering or website manipulation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The bug report mentions that the issue was resolved by creating a new browsing context for about:reader pages, severing opener relationships and preventing attackers from navigating back into reader mode.
- The vulnerability affects both Firefox and Thunderbird.
- The fix also included changes to the way reader mode handles redirects by caching the responses to avoid incorrect handling of cookies.
- The issue was identified by an external researcher and was addressed in Firefox 100 and Firefox ESR 91.9.
