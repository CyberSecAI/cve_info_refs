# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

Shouldn't this be `strlen($cur) >= 1 && ...`? If a password could be `strlen(2)` before, I suspect it might have been `strlen(1)` as well? 🤔

I'm still not sure whether it's a good idea to allow *any* string as a settings key. Why not maintain a list of allowed settings and error out if users are trying to set an unsupported settings key?

As it is currently - and with only `password_single` being hashed, I expect plaintext passwords to end up in the database due to typos by the users. E.g. when you do something like `occ circles:manage:setting <circle_id> password_sigle my_secret_password` (note the typo in "sigle").

I am fine with it. 99% of the people will use the front-end to set those settings (with pre-defined keys)

### @ArtificialOwl **[ArtificialOwl](/ArtificialOwl)** commented [Dec 16, 2021](#issue-1082165465) • edited Loading

So, the hard part was to keep the clear password on the master instance while creating shares on slaves (in global scale setup)

* When a new member is added, or a new share is created, the main instance will generate a list of Clean Passwords and their Hash. Hash will be shared to slaves to be used when generating the share token,
* Each slave will use a different hashed password for each members and inherited members of the circle. And will returns the list of generate share,
* Main instance get informations about the generate shares, and generate a mail per members and inherited members with the right password from the list.
* test in large global scale env,
* test in single instance with mass member add,
* create password the same way that shared by mail,
* check local settings for enforcing password, add also an option in the apps itself

Sorry, something went wrong.
