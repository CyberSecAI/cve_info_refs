Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The CVS Plugin does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of escaping allows malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the parameter name or description.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript, which can be executed in the browser of users who view the affected pages.
- This could lead to various actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker needs to have "Item/Configure" permission to modify the parameter's name or description and inject the malicious script.
- The XSS is triggered when the parameter is displayed on pages such as the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages provided by Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have at least "Item/Configure" permission within Jenkins to modify job configurations and add the malicious script within the parameter's name or description.
- The attacker does not necessarily need access to the Jenkins controller file system to perform this attack.
- The attacker also needs the vulnerable Jenkins plugin version.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of similar vulnerabilities affecting multiple Jenkins plugins.
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue, meaning the malicious code is stored within Jenkins and executed when the affected pages are viewed.
- Jenkins core and some plugins have been updated to prevent exploitation of this type of XSS, but other plugins remain vulnerable and are listed in the advisory.
