Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `id` parameter within the `/scbs/admin/?page=facilities/manage_facility` URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly uses the `id` parameter value in an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- The specific vulnerability is located within the `/scbs/admin/?page=facilities/manage_facility` endpoint, specifically the `id` parameter in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information. In the example provided, they can determine the database name and its length using the `length(database())` function.
- **Potential for Full Database Compromise:** Depending on the database permissions and the specific SQL injection, an attacker might be able to read, modify, or delete data, execute arbitrary queries, or even gain access to the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable URL with a malicious SQL payload in the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- **Basic Knowledge of SQL:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to craft the injection payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The provided information does not explicitly state that authentication is required to access the vulnerable endpoint. However, the path `/scbs/admin/` suggests it is likely an admin panel.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided payload `id=3%27%20and%20length(database())%20=7--+` demonstrates how to determine the length of the database name. The single quote (`'`) is used to break out of the original SQL query, `and length(database()) = 7` is injected SQL code and `--+` comments out the rest of the original query.
- The content-length of the HTTP response changes based on the validity of the SQL injection, this is how the exploit is verified.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content references an online sports complex booking system from `sourcecodester.com`.
- The vulnerability is specifically located in the `/scbs/admin/?page=facilities/manage_facility&id=` endpoint.
- The database name is `scbs_db` with a length of 7.
- The attacker is using boolean based SQLi.
