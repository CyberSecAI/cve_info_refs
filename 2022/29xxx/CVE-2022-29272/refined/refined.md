      "root_cause": "The login.php file does not validate the redirect parameter.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Open redirect"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can redirect a user to an arbitrary website after login.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted URL with malicious redirect parameter in the login.php file."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with a redirect parameter.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists because the login form does not validate or sanitize the redirect parameter. This allows an attacker to construct a malicious URL that, upon successful authentication, will redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing. This could lead to phishing attacks or other malicious activity."

  "CVE-2022-29270": {
    "vulnerability_details": {

        "Insecure account management",

        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the victim's workplace with a valid NagiosXI session.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because Nagios XI does not require the user to enter their current password when changing their account's email address. This allows an attacker with access to an active session to change the associated email address to one they control, and then request a password reset, gaining complete access to the victim's account."
