#### Verizon 4G LTE Network Extender Weak Credentials Algorithm

Title: Verizon 4G LTE Network Extender Weak Credentials Algorithm

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2022-5701](ZSL-2022-5701.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Security Bypass

Risk: (3/5)

Release Date: 13.04.2022
##### Summary

An LTE Network Extender enhances your indoor and 4G
LTE data and voice coverage to provide better service for your
4G LTE mobile devices. It's an extension of our 4G LTE network
that's placed directly in your home or office. The LTE Network
Extender works with all Verizon-sold 4G LTE mobile devices for
4G LTE data service and HD Voice-capable 4G LTE devices for voice
service. This easy-to-install device operates like a miniature
cell tower that plugs into your existing high-speed broadband
connection to communicate with the Verizon wireless network.
##### Description

Verizon's 4G LTE Network Extender is utilising a weak
default admin password generation algorithm. The password is
generated using the last 4 values from device's MAC address
which is disclosed on the main webUI login page to an unauthenticated
attacker. The values are then concatenated with the string
