The content is related to CVE-2022-29368.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the `TypedArray` constructor when calculating the end offset, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow when calculating the end offset: `offset + size` can overflow, bypassing the range check.
- Out-of-bounds read in `fxUint8Getter`: The `offset` parameter, controlled by the attacker, is added to the buffer address without proper validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary memory read primitive: Attackers can read data from arbitrary memory locations.
- Program crash: The out-of-bounds read leads to a segmentation fault, crashing the program.

**Attack vectors:**
- JavaScript code execution: By providing malicious input to the `TypedArray` constructor and then accessing elements, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within the vulnerable environment.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability and the ability to craft a specific payload.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in `xsDataView.c` within the `fxUint8Getter` function and the `TypedArray` constructor.
- The issue was fixed by replacing `offset + size` with `fxAddChunkSizes(the, offset, size)` to properly handle integer overflow, and adding an additional check `(info->value.bufferInfo.length < end) || (end < offset)`.
- The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how to trigger the out-of-bounds read.
- The fix was committed in commit `135aa9a4a6a9b49b60aa730ebc3bcc6247d75c45`.
