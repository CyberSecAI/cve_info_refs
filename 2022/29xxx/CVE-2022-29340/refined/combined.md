### **[hmnthabit](/hmnthabit)** commented [Apr 1, 2022](#issuecomment-1086249049)

| Thanks for reporting this  What's the problem of checking `a` strucut before the switch statement? [@jeanlf](https://github.com/jeanlf)  Also, it's better to test the poc against all the arguments that do file parsing. |
