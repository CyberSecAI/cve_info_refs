Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The application suffers from improper access control. This allows an authenticated operator to access and disclose SHA1 password hashes of other users/operators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access controls, allowing an authenticated user to access sensitive information (password hashes) of other users.
- **Client-Side Hash Disclosure:** The SHA1 password hashes are exposed on the client-side, meaning they are directly accessible through the application's interface or data handling.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Security Bypass:** Successful exploitation can lead to a security bypass, as attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access.
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  The disclosure of SHA1 password hashes allows attackers to potentially compromise user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local/Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited both locally and remotely by an attacker with legitimate access to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Operator:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user/operator of the Protege GX/WX application. This means they would already have a valid account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory explicitly mentions that the password hashes are SHA1, which is considered weak and susceptible to cracking.
- The vendor was contacted but the vendor's support is primarily for Certified Protégé Installers only, which delayed the fixing of the issue.

In summary, the vulnerability allows an authenticated user to access and reveal password hashes of other users, highlighting a significant access control issue.
