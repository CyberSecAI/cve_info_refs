- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient escaping when rendering `@mentions` in the wire-webapp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in the context of a victim's session by sending a specially crafted message. This allows an attacker to fully control the user's account. Wire-desktop clients connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malicious message containing specially crafted `@mentions` to a user via the wire-webapp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send messages to a user of a vulnerable wire-webapp instance. No special privileges are required. User interaction is required by the victim to view the message.
