The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability found in the Online Sports Complex Booking System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `id` parameter within the `/scbs/admin/?page=clients/manage_client` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi): The application directly embeds the `id` parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, client details, and other data, as shown in the provided examples where the database name is being extracted.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the vulnerable endpoint with malicious SQL code in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
- No authentication is mentioned as required for exploiting the vulnerability.
- The attacker requires knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint `/scbs/admin/?page=clients/manage_client&id=`.
