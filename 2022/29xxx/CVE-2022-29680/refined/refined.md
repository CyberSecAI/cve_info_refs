Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization when deleting users in the `sys_User.php_zu_del` file. Specifically, the `id[]` parameter in the POST request is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates unsanitized user-supplied data (`id[]`) into an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Blind SQL Injection:** The vulnerability is characterized as a blind SQL injection, as the attacker cannot directly see the output of the query. However, the attacker can use time-based techniques (like `sleep()`) to determine if the injected code is being executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Database Information Leakage:** An attacker can extract sensitive database information such as the database name, table structure, and data.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:** With a successful SQL injection, an attacker could modify or delete data in the database, potentially leading to data corruption or loss.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By utilizing time-based attacks (`sleep()`), the attacker can cause significant delays and disrupt the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted HTTP POST request to `/admin.php/user/zu_del`
*   **`id[]` parameter:** The malicious SQL payload is injected through the `id[]` parameter in the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Administrator:** The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to access the vulnerable functionality (`/admin.php/user/zu_del`)
*   **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft malicious injection payloads.

**Technical Details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerable code resides in `sys_User.php_zu_del`.
*   The attack is triggered during user deletion after an administrator logs in and navigates to add/delete members.
*   The attacker crafted a POST request with a malicious SQL payload within the `id[]` parameter, demonstrating the use of `sleep()` for time-based blind injection.
*   The attacker was able to infer the database name 'cscms' by using `(case(1)when(ascii(substr((select(database()))from(1)for(1)))=99)then(sleep(5))else(1)end)` payload.
*   The specific POST request that demonstrated the vulnerability was:
    ```
