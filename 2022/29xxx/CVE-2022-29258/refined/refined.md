Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29258

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper handling of user-provided input within the `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm` wiki page. Specifically, request parameters were directly inserted as default values in form fields without proper escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. User-supplied values in the form parameters are not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code did not sanitize user input before rendering it as HTML, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the form fields, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the page. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Data theft and manipulation:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive user data or modify data in the application through the execution of malicious scripts

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack can be carried out by crafting a malicious URL with the XSS payload in the parameters.
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript into request parameters that are used to populate form values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, needing no special access to the application.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the parameters used to populate form fields in `Filter.FilterStreamDescriptorForm`.
- **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** The attacker has to be able to craft URLs containing the malicious javascript payloads in the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects XWiki versions >= 6.0-milestone-2 and >= 5.4.4.
- The issue was fixed in versions 12.10.11, 13.4.7, 13.10.3, and 14.0-rc-1.
- The fix involves escaping the request parameters using `$escapetool.xml()` before including them in the HTML.
- The vulnerable code snippet was in `Filter/FilterStreamDescriptorForm.xml`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- The CVSS score is 7.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-80 and CWE-116.
