* ### SS-2024-002 Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in error message

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-002
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  This vulnerability only affects sites which are in the "dev" environment mode. If your production website is in "dev" mode, it has been misconfigured, and you should immediately swap it to "live" mode.
   See <https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/debugging/environment_types/> for more information.

  If a website has been set to the "dev" environment mode, a URL can be provided which includes an XSS payload which will be executed in the resulting error message.

  **Base CVSS:** [0.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2024-53277 XSS in form messages

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-53277
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  In some cases, form messages can contain HTML markup. This is an intentional feature, allowing links and other relevant HTML markup for the given message.

  Some form messages include content that the user can provide. There are scenarios in the CMS where that content doesn't get correctly sanitised prior to being included in the form message, resulting in an XSS vulnerability.

  **Base CVSS:** [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2024-47605 XSS via insert media remote file oembed

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-47605
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.3.8
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.3.8
  Release Date:2025-01-15

  When using the "insert media" functionality, the linked oEmbed JSON includes an HTML attribute which will replace the embed shortcode. The HTML is not sanitized before replacing the shortcode, allowing a script payload to be executed on both the CMS and the front-end of the website.

  See <https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/developer_guides/forms/field_types/htmleditorfield/#sandboxing-oembed-html> for details about configuring embed sandboxing.

  **Base CVSS:** [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N&version=3.1)

* ### SS-2024-001 TinyMCE allows svg files linked in object tags

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.2.16
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.2.16
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  TinyMCE v6 has a configuration value convert\_unsafe\_embeds set to false which allows svg files containing javascript to saved which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks

  After patching the default value of convert\_unsafe\_embeds will be set to true. This means that object tags will be converted to iframes instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon previously saved object tags. Users are to override this config if desired so that object tags are again used instead of iframes. Note that embed tags are not allowed by default.
  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

  This vulnerability was described by TinyMCE as follows:

  *A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.*

* ### CVE-2024-29885 Reports are still accessible even when canView is set to false

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-29885
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/reports: <5.2.3
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/reports: 5.2.3
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  The `Report` class has a `canView` method. If that method is configured to return `false`, the current user should not be able to view the report. While the report list will omit any `canView` `false` reports, those reports can still access them directly assuming the user has the `CMS\_ACCESS\_ReportAdmin` permission.

  After patching the `canView` check will be properly respected

  **Base CVSS**: [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-49783 - No permission checks for editing or deleting records with CSV import form

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-49783
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1, ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.13.19, 2.1.8
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  Users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.

  The likelyhood of a user having create permissions but *not* having edit or delete permissions is low, but it *is* possible.

  Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.

  #### Action may be required

  If you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.

  If you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.

  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.11.39, 5.1.11
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  If a user should not be able to see a record, but that record can be added to a `GridField` using the `GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter` component, the record's title can be accessed by that user.

  **Base CVSS: [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-44401 - View permissions are bypassed for paginated lists of ORM data in GraphQL queries

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-44401
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/graphql: 4.3.7, 5.1.3
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page.

  Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se.

  This has been fixed by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in your query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results.

  This behaviour is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly.

  You can choose to disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin following the instructions in [overriding default plugins](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/graphql/plugins/overview/#overriding-default-plugins).

  Note that this vulnerability does not affect silverstripe/graphql version 3.x.

  **Base CVSS: [5.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-40180 - DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries

  Severity:
  High ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-40180
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^3.0.0, ^4.0.0, ^5.0.0
  Versions Fixed:3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, 5.0.3
  Release Date:2023-10-16

  An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk.

  The fix includes some new configuration options which you might want to tweak for your project, based on your own requirements. See the documentation in the references for details.

  **Base CVSS: [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)**

* ### SS-2023-002 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities inherited form TinyMCE

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2023-002
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: ^1.13.6
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.

  Only Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by these vulnerabilities. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.

  Silverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by these vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.

  These vulnerabilities were described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

* ### CVE-2023-32302 Members with no password can be created and bypass custom login forms

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-32302
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.13.14, 5.0.13
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  When a new Member record was created in the cms it was possible to set a blank password. If an attacker knows the email address of the user with the blank password then they can attempt to log in using an empty password. The default member authenticator, login form and basic auth all require a non-empty password, however if a custom authentication method is used it may allow a successful login with the empty password.

  After being patched, blank passwords are no no longer allowed when members are created in the CMS. Programatically created Member records, such as those used in unit tests, still allow blank passwords.

  You may have some Member records in your system already which have empty passwords. To detect these, you can loop over all Member records with `Member::get()` and pass each record into the below method. It might be sensible to create a `BuildTask` for this purpose.

  ```
  use SilverStripe\Security\Member;
  use SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\MemberAuthenticator;

  private function memberHasBlankPassword(Member $member): bool
  {
      // skip default admin as this is created programatically
      if ($member->isDefaultAdmin()) {
          return false;
      }
      // return true if a blank password is valid for this member
      $authenticator = new MemberAuthenticator();
      return $authenticator->checkPassword($member, '')->isValid();
  }
  ```

  Once you have identified the records with empty passwords, it's up to you how to handle this. The most sensible way to resolve this is probably to generate a new secure password for each of these members, mark it as immediately expired, and email each affected member (assuming they have a valid email address in the system).

  **Base CVSS**: [0.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:X/RC:C&version=3.1)

  #### Addendum - November 2, 2023

  [CVE-2023-32302](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32302) has been invalidated. Following discussions with the *National Institute of Standards and Technology* (NIST), it was determined that entries in the *National Vulnerability Database* can not have a CVSS of 0.

  While CVE-2023-32302 is no longer a valid vulnerability identifier, the rest of the information on this page remains relevant.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

### Plans & Pricing

#### What are the differences between the Free, Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Release process[#](#release-process)

This page describes the process followed for "core" releases
(the modules included by [silverstripe/recipe-core](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-core)
and [silverstripe/recipe-cms](https://github.com/silverstripe/recipe-cms)).

## Release planning[#](#release-planning)

The Silverstripe CMS core team uses an Agile methodology. We aim to keep the latest development branches of each
module in a "potentially releasable" state. Releases are planned around an issue backlog according to our
[roadmap](https://www.silverstripe.org/software/roadmap/). We re-revaluate our priorities every few weeks.

Silverstripe CMS is split up into many modules listed on [`github.com/silverstripe`](https://github.com/silverstripe).
Each may have a different release line (e.g. 2.x vs. 5.x).
There are high-level "recipe" milestones on the [framework repository](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/milestones)
to combine individual module milestones into a larger release that's eventually available to install with
[composer](https://silverstripe.org/download).

New features and API changes are discussed as
[GitHub issues](/en/5/contributing/issues_and_bugs/)),
as well as the [forum](https://forum.silverstripe.org).
They are prioritised by the core team as tickets on
GitHub. In addition, we collect community feedback as [feature ideas](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/feature-ideas) on the forum.
Any feature ideas we're planning to implement will be flagged there.

## Keeping track[#](#keeping-track)

Release dates are usually not published prior to the release, but you can get a good idea of the release status by
reviewing the release milestone on GitHub. Releases will be
announced on the ["releases" forum category](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases).
Significant releases will also be published via the [`silverstripe.org` blog](https://silverstripe.org/blog).

You can also keep track of new releases through the CMS UI
by installing the [maintenance module](https://github.com/bringyourownideas/silverstripe-maintenance),
or using the [composer outdated](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#outdated) command in your project.

Additionally, you can [keep track of issues](/en/5/contributing/issues_and_bugs#identifying-issues/) (both open and closed)
across all modules involved in a recipe release.

## Release numbering[#](#release-numbering)

Silverstripe CMS follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

All Silverstripe CMS modules (including `silverstripe/framework`) may have patch releases created at any time, and will
not necessarily match other core module patch release numbers. For example, your project may be using
`silverstripe/cms` 5.3.1 with `silverstripe/versioned` 5.3.9.

All Silverstripe CMS recipes are released in lock step with each other. For example, `silverstripe/installer` 5.3.1 will
contain `silverstripe/recipe-cms` 5.3.1 and `silverstripe/recipe-core` 5.3.1. These recipes may contain various patch
versions of its modules within the same minor release line (5.3 in this example).

## Regular minor releases[#](#regular-minor-releases)

Regular minor releases are preceded by pre-stable releases to help lay the groundwork for the stable release.

See our [minor release policy](/en/5/project_governance/minor_release_policy/) for details about our release cadence.

### Beta phase[#](#beta-phase)

At the start of the Beta phase:

* new minor branches for core modules are forked from the major branches
* a feature freeze is instituted on the minor branches
* a `beta1` release is tagged for recipes and related modules.

The length of the beta phase period will be communicated at the time it is tagged via the [Silverstripe Forum](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases). While the beta phase lasts additional betas may be released to address critical issues holding back
testers.

#### "Beta release" definition[#](#beta-release-definition)

The purpose of a beta release is to initiate a "Feature Freeze" to stabilise the Silverstripe CMS codebase for an upcoming stable release and showcase
new features. A beta release is likely to contain regressions and new bugs. A beta release is primarily aimed at testers
who want to help identify bugs and regressions.

#### "Feature freeze" definition[#](#feature-freeze-definition)

A "Feature freeze" is a pre-release minor branch state. This state allows the core team to stabilise the upcoming
release and reach production quality.

The following type of changes can be merged in a branch in feature freeze:

* bug fixes, regardless of severity
* API changes if they fix a bug and are compliant with our existing semver commitments
* merge-ups from older minor branches (introducing bug fixes).

The following changes cannot be merged in a branch in feature freeze:

* anything that introduces new features
* API changes not targeted to fixing a bug, or that alter an existing API in a stable release.

### Release candidate phase[#](#release-candidate-phase)

All critical or high priority issues in the beta release should have been identified and fixed by the start of the
Release Candidate phase.

At the start of the Release Candidate phase:

* a publicly visible `rc1` release is tagged for recipes and related modules
* a private Release Candidate is created containing fixes for undisclosed vulnerabilities on top of the `rc1` release
* the private Release Candidate is delivered to independent auditors for a security review.

The Release Candidate phase lasts approximately two weeks. Additional patches may be added to the final release only if:

* vulnerabilities are discovered by the security audit
* additional critical issues are identified.

#### "Release Candidate" definition[#](#release-candidate-definition)

A release candidate will not introduce any new features compared to its preceding beta release. The Silverstripe CMS
core team is confident a release candidate is production quality and does not introduce new regressions.

The purpose of a release candidate is to allow module maintainers and project owners to audit the upcoming release and
confidently plan their upgrades.

Only critical bug fixes can be added to the upcoming stable release once the release candidate is released.

### Stable phase[#](#stable-phase)

A new stable minor release is tagged for Silverstripe CMS core recipes. This marks the start of our official semver
commitment for any new APIs introduced in that minor release.

## Supported versions[#](#supported-versions)

At any point in time, the core development team will support a set of releases to varying levels. The current support status is outlined on the [roadmap](https://silverstripe.org/roadmap).

See the [minor release policy](/en/5/project_governance/minor_release_policy/) and [major release policy](/en/5/project_governance/major_release_policy/) for more information.

## Deprecation[#](#deprecation)

Needs of developers (both on core framework and custom projects) can outgrow the capabilities
of a certain API. Existing APIs might turn out to be hard to understand, maintain, test or stabilise.
In these cases, it is best practice to "refactor" these APIs into something more useful.
The Silverstripe CMS team acknowledges that developers have built a lot of code on top of existing APIs,
so we strive for giving ample warning on any upcoming changes through a "deprecation cycle".

### Deprecating API[#](#deprecating-api)

* Add a `@deprecated` item to the docblock tag, with a `{@link <class>}` item pointing to the new API to use.
* Update the deprecated code to throw a [Deprecation::notice()](https://api.silverstripe.org/search/lookup?q=SilverStripe%5CDev%5CDeprecation::notice()&version=5) error.
* Deprecations should not be committed to patch releases
* Both the docblock and error message should contain the **version** where the functionality is deprecated from.
  So, if you're committing the change to a *4.12* minor release, the target version will be *4.12.0*.
* Deprecations should only be committed to pre-release branches, ideally before they enter the "beta" phase.
  If deprecations are introduced after this point, their target version needs to be increased by one.
* Make sure that the old deprecated function works by calling the new function - don't have duplicated code!
* The commit message should contain an `API` prefix (see ["commit message format"](/en/5/contributing/code#commit-messages/))
* Document the change in the [changelog](/en/5/changelogs) for the next release
* Deprecated APIs can be removed only after developers have had sufficient time to react to the changes. Hence, deprecated APIs should be removed in MAJOR releases only. Between MAJOR releases, leave the code in place with a deprecation warning.
* Exceptions to the deprecation cycle are APIs that have been moved into their own module, and continue to work with the new minor release. These changes can be performed in a single minor release without a deprecation period.

When deprecating a method:

* Add the following docblock `@deprecated 1.2.3 Use anotherMethod() instead`
* Deprecation::notice('1.2.3', 'Use anotherMethod() instead'); to the top of the method

When deprecating a class:

* Add the following docblock `@deprecated 1.2.3 Use AnotherClass instead`
* Add `Deprecation::notice('1.2.3', 'Use AnotherClass instead', Deprecation::SCOPE_CLASS);` to the top of `__construct()`
* Wrap `Deprecation::notice()` with `Deprecation::withNoReplacement()` if there's no replacement for that deprecated class. e.g:

```
namespace App;

/**
 * @deprecated 4.12.0 Will be removed without equivalent functionality
 */
class MyDeprecatedClass extends AnotherClass
{
    public function __construct()
    {
        Deprecation::withNoReplacement(function () {
            Deprecation::notice(
                '4.12.0',
                'Will be removed without equivalent functionality',
                Deprecation::SCOPE_CLASS
            );
        });
        parent::__construct();
    }
}
```

When deprecating config:

* Add the following docblock `@deprecated 1.2.3 Use different_config instead`

When deprecating some behaviour or combination of configuration values:

* Add `Deprecation::notice('1.2.3', 'Using x with y is deprecated. Do [other thing] instead', Deprecation::SCOPE_GLOBAL);`
* It may not be immediately clear where this type of deprecation notice should go. In that case, add it to the `HTTPApplication::warnAboutDeprecatedSetups()` method.
* It may be appropriate to link to some documentation in the message for this type of deprecation notice.

If there is no immediate replacement for deprecated code that is being called, either because the replacement is not available until the next major version, or because there is not a plan for there to be a replacement, the message should be "Will be removed without equivalent functionality to replace it."

### Avoiding deprecated API[#](#avoiding-deprecated-api)

Wherever possible, once some API has been deprecated, we should stop using it. This allows projects to emit deprecation notices and have an accurate list of code that they need to change.

In some cases, we may not yet have a replacement for code that is required for the current major - but that we still have to call and support internally. In these cases, since we can't stop calling the code, wrap the call to the deprecated code in `Deprecation::withNoReplacement()` e.g:

```
use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;

// ...

// The $myVariable variable will get the result of the call to $obj->myDeprecatedMethod()
$myVariable = Deprecation::withNoReplacement(function () {
    return $obj->myDeprecatedMethod();
});
```

For any unit tests using the deprecated method/class/config, add the following the the top of the unit test. This ensures that deprecated code is still supported as usual when `Deprecation` notices are not enabled, though the tests are skipped whenever you are testing to see if deprecated code is still be called.

```
namespace SilverStripe\Test;

use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;
use SilverStripe\Dev\SapphireTest;

class MyTest extends SapphireTest
{
    public function testSomething()
    {
        if (Deprecation::isEnabled()) {
            $this->markTestSkipped('Test calls deprecated code');
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

Here's an example for replacing `Director::isDev()` with a (theoretical) `Env::is_dev()`:

```
namespace SilverStripe\Control;

use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;
// ...

class Director
{
    // ...

    /**
     * Returns true if your are in development mode
     * @deprecated 4.12.0 Use Env::is_dev() instead.
     */
    public function isDev()
    {
        Deprecation::notice('4.12.0', 'Use Env::is_dev() instead');
        return Env::is_dev();
    }
}
```

This change could be committed to a minor release like *4.12.0*, and remains deprecated in all subsequent minor releases
(e.g. *4.13.0*), until a new major release (e.g. *5.0.0*), at which point it gets removed from the codebase.

### Enabling deprecation notices[#](#enabling-deprecation-notices)

Deprecation notices aren't enabled by default. They can be turned on for dev environments with one of the following methods:

`.env`

```
SS_DEPRECATION_ENABLED=true
```

```
// app/_config.php
use SilverStripe\Dev\Deprecation;

Deprecation::enable();
```

To test that deprecated code is no longer being called, run code via CI in an installer/kitchen-sink project that has deprecations enabled. Then view the CI output in the "Run tests" of the GitHub actions CI job and/or view the contents of `silverstripe.log` in the GitHub actions CI artifact to see if there are deprecation warnings. There should be zero deprecation warnings.

## Security releases[#](#security-releases)

A security release is a [Silverstripe CMS Core Release](/en/5/contributing/making_a_silverstripe_core_release#standard-release-process/) with patches for one or more security issues.

### Reporting an issue[#](#reporting-an-issue)

Report security issues in our [commercially supported modules](/en/5/project_governance/supported_modules/)
to security@silverstripe.org.
Please don't file security issues in our [bugtracker](/en/5/contributing/issues_and_bugs/).

Silverstripe CMS does not operate a *bug bounty* program.

### Acknowledgment and disclosure[#](#acknowledgment-and-disclosure)

In the event of a confirmed vulnerability in our
[supported modules](/en/5/project_governance/supported_modules/),
we will take the following actions:

* Acknowledge to the reporter that we've received the report and that a fix is forthcoming.
  We'll give a rough timeline and ask the reporter to keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
* Assign a [CVE identifier](https://cve.mitre.org) to the issue.
* For "high" and "critical" issues (CVSS of >=7.0): Pre-announce the upcoming security release to a private pre-announcement mailing list of important stakeholders (see below).
* We will inform you about resolution and [announce](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases) a
  [new release](https://www.silverstripe.org/security-releases/) publicly.

You can help us determine the problem and speed up responses by providing us with more information on how to reproduce
the issue:

* Silverstripe CMS version (incl. any installed modules)
* PHP/webserver version and configuration
* anonymised webserver access logs (if a hack is suspected)
* any other services and web packages running on the same server.

### Severity rating[#](#severity-rating)

Each [security release](https://www.silverstripe.org/security-releases/) includes an overall severity rating and one for
each vulnerability. The rating indicates how important an update is.
It follows the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss).
This rating determines which release lines are targeted with security fixes.

| Severity | CVSS | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | 9.0 to 10.0 | Critical releases require immediate action. Such vulnerabilities allow attackers to take control of your site and you should upgrade on the day of release. *Example: Directory traversal, privilege escalation* |
| **High** | 7.0 to 8.9 | Important releases should be evaluated immediately. These issues allow an attacker to compromise a site's data and should be fixed within days. *Example: SQL injection.* |
| **Medium** | 4.0 to 6.9 | Releases of moderate severity should be applied as soon as possible. They allow the unauthorized editing or creation of content. *Examples: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in template helpers.* |
| **Low** | 0.1 to 3.9 | Low risk releases fix information disclosure and read-only privilege escalation vulnerabilities. These updates should also be applied as soon as possible, but with an impact-dependent priority. *Example: Exposure of the core version number, Cross Site Scripting (XSS) limited to the admin interface.* |
| **None** | 0.0 | These releases won't affect a large majority of projects, and may not require any action. They only impact projects with extremely complex or unlikely customisations. They do not impact projects which only implement common customisations or use common features. |

### Internal security process[#](#internal-security-process)

See [Silverstripe CMS Core Release Process](/en/5/contributing/making_a_silverstripe_core_release/).

### Pre-announcement mailing list[#](#pre-announcement-mailing-list)

In addition to our public disclosure process, we maintain a private mailing list where upcoming
"high" and "critical" security releases are pre-announced.
Members of this list will receive a security pre-announcement, as soon as it has been
sufficiently researched, with a timeline for the upcoming release.
This will happen a few days before the announcement goes public alongside a new release,
and most likely before a patch has been developed.

Since we'll distribute sensitive information on unpatched vulnerabilities in this list,
the selection criteria for joining naturally has to be strict.
Applicants should provide references within the community,
as well as a demonstrated need for this level of information
(e.g. involvement with a large website with sensitive customer data).
You don’t need to be a client of Silverstripe Ltd to get on board,
but we will need to perform some low-touch background checks to verify your identity.
Please contact security@silverstripe.org for details.

Only "high" and "critical" issues are pre-announced via the mailing list. If you want
to know about all the minor security mitigations, keep an eye on the ["releases" forum category](https://forum.silverstripe.org/c/releases),
changelogs and the website section [Security Releases](https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/).

## Quality assurance and testing[#](#quality-assurance-and-testing)

The quality of our software is important to us, and we continuously test it for regressions
through a broad suite of unit and integration tests. These run on
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions), and results are publicly available.
Check the badges on the various modules available on [`github.com/silverstripe`](https://github.com/silverstripe).

* ### SS-2024-001 TinyMCE allows svg files linked in object tags

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2024-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: <5.2.16
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 5.2.16
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  TinyMCE v6 has a configuration value convert\_unsafe\_embeds set to false which allows svg files containing javascript to saved which can be used as a vector for XSS attacks

  After patching the default value of convert\_unsafe\_embeds will be set to true. This means that object tags will be converted to iframes instead the next time the page is saved, which may break any pages that rely upon previously saved object tags. Users are to override this config if desired so that object tags are again used instead of iframes. Note that embed tags are not allowed by default.
  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

  This vulnerability was described by TinyMCE as follows:

  *A [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE’s content loading and content inserting code. A SVG image could be loaded though an `object` or `embed` element and that image could potentially contain a XSS payload.*

  **Base CVSS**: [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:R&version=3.1)

  Severity:

  Release Date:2024-07-17

  A specially crafted XSS payload could be inserted into a field in the CMS when logged in as a CMS user with regular permissions. This XSS could be executed either in the CMS or on the front-end of the website.

* ### CVE-2024-29885 Reports are still accessible even when canView is set to false

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2024-29885
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/reports: <5.2.3
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/reports: 5.2.3
  Release Date:2024-07-17

  The `Report` class has a `canView` method. If that method is configured to return `false`, the current user should not be able to view the report. While the report list will omit any `canView` `false` reports, those reports can still access them directly assuming the user has the `CMS\_ACCESS\_ReportAdmin` permission.

  After patching the `canView` check will be properly respected

  **Base CVSS**: [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-49783 - No permission checks for editing or deleting records with CSV import form

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-49783
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1, ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.13.19, 2.1.8
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  Users who don't have edit or delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have create permissions.

  The likelyhood of a user having create permissions but *not* having edit or delete permissions is low, but it *is* possible.

  Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the import form disabled via the [`showImportForm` public property](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Admin/ModelAdmin.html#property_showImportForm), nor does it impact the `SecurityAdmin` section.

  #### Action may be required

  If you have a custom implementation of [`BulkLoader`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html), you should update your implementation to respect permissions when the return value of [`getCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_getCheckPermissions) is true.

  If you are using any `BulkLoader` in your own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, you should consider passing `true` to [`setCheckPermissions()`](https://api.silverstripe.org/4/SilverStripe/Dev/BulkLoader.html#method_setCheckPermissions) if the data is provided by users.

* ### CVE-2023-48714 - Record titles for restricted records can be viewed if exposed by GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-48714
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.11.39, 5.1.11
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  If a user should not be able to see a record, but that record can be added to a `GridField` using the `GridFieldAddExistingAutocompleter` component, the record's title can be accessed by that user.

  **Base CVSS: [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-44401 - View permissions are bypassed for paginated lists of ORM data in GraphQL queries

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-44401
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/graphql: 4.3.7, 5.1.3
  Release Date:2024-01-23

  `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records is greater than the number of records per page.

  Note that this also affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query isn’t paginated per se.

  This has been fixed by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This may result in some pages in your query results having less than the maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of results.

  This behaviour is consistent with how pagination works in other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in the database directly.

  You can choose to disable these permission checks by disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin following the instructions in [overriding default plugins](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/graphql/plugins/overview/#overriding-default-plugins).

  Note that this vulnerability does not affect silverstripe/graphql version 3.x.

  **Base CVSS: [5.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2023-40180 - DDOS Vulnerability on GraphQL due to lack of protection against recursive queries

  Severity:
  High ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-40180
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/graphql: ^3.0.0, ^4.0.0, ^5.0.0
  Versions Fixed:3.8.2, 4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, 5.0.3
  Release Date:2023-10-16

  An attacker could use a recursive graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further mitigate the risk.

  The fix includes some new configuration options which you might want to tweak for your project, based on your own requirements. See the documentation in the references for details.

  **Base CVSS: [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)**

  Release Date:2023-07-31

  TinyMCE 4.x is vulnerable to several XSS vectors, which had been patched in later versions. Two of these have been identified as affecting `silverstripe/admin`.

  Only Silverstripe CMS 4 is affected by these vulnerabilities. It's not possible to upgrade Silverstripe CMS 4 to use a more recent release of TinyMCE without introducing breaking changes. Instead, the security patches that shipped in later releases of TinyMCE have been backported to the TinyMCE version bundled in `silverstripe/admin`.

  Silverstripe CMS 5 is not affected by these vulnerabilities because it uses TinyMCE 6.

  These vulnerabilities were described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the schema validation logic of the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor using the clipboard or editor APIs. This malicious content could then end up in content published outside the editor, if no server-side sanitization was performed. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 5.8.2 or lower.

* ### CVE-2023-32302 Members with no password can be created and bypass custom login forms

  Severity:
  None ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-32302
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^3, ^4, ^5
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: 4.13.14, 5.0.13
  Release Date:2023-07-31

  When a new Member record was created in the cms it was possible to set a blank password. If an attacker knows the email address of the user with the blank password then they can attempt to log in using an empty password. The default member authenticator, login form and basic auth all require a non-empty password, however if a custom authentication method is used it may allow a successful login with the empty password.

  After being patched, blank passwords are no no longer allowed when members are created in the CMS. Programatically created Member records, such as those used in unit tests, still allow blank passwords.

  You may have some Member records in your system already which have empty passwords. To detect these, you can loop over all Member records with `Member::get()` and pass each record into the below method. It might be sensible to create a `BuildTask` for this purpose.

  ```
  use SilverStripe\Security\Member;
  use SilverStripe\Security\MemberAuthenticator\MemberAuthenticator;

  private function memberHasBlankPassword(Member $member): bool
  {
      // skip default admin as this is created programatically
      if ($member->isDefaultAdmin()) {
          return false;
      }
      // return true if a blank password is valid for this member
      $authenticator = new MemberAuthenticator();
      return $authenticator->checkPassword($member, '')->isValid();
  }
  ```

  Once you have identified the records with empty passwords, it's up to you how to handle this. The most sensible way to resolve this is probably to generate a new secure password for each of these members, mark it as immediately expired, and email each affected member (assuming they have a valid email address in the system).

* ### SS-2023-001 - XSS vulnerability in underlying TinyMCE library

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:SS-2023-001
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/admin: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/admin: 1.12.7, 1.13.0
  Release Date:2023-04-26

  An old version of TinyMCE includes an XSS vulnerability, which was patched in a later version. The vulnerability is described by TinyMCE:

  > A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in the core parser. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when inserting a specially crafted piece of content into the editor via the clipboard or APIs. This impacts all users who are using TinyMCE 4.9.10 or lower and TinyMCE 5.4.0 or lower.

  We reviewed the potential impact of this vulnerability within the context of Silverstripe CMS. We concluded this is a medium impact vulnerability given how TinyMCE is used by Silverstripe CMS.

* ### CVE-2023-28104 - DDOS attack on graphql endpoints

  Severity:
  High ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2023-28104
  Versions Affected:4.2.2, 4.1.1
  Versions Fixed:4.2.3, 4.1.2
  Release Date:2023-03-16

  An attacker could use a specially crafted graphql query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack) against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed and particularly large/complex graphql schemas.

  If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this will likely further mitigate the risk.

  **Base CVSS**: [7.5](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2022-42949 - Subsite weakens file permissions

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2022-42949
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/subsites: ^2
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/subsites: ^2.6.1, ^2.7.0
  Release Date:2022-12-19

  The subsites module can weaken edit restrictions on some files and allow a malicious user to edit files they do not have edit rights to.

  This only affects projects with the subsites module installed. Regression testing should focus on custom file logic.

  Be advised that this is not a case of a user being able to edit a file in subsites they do not have access to. As a reminder, all separation of content achieved with the subsites module should be viewed as cosmetic and not appropriate for security-critical applications.

  **Base CVSS**: [5.4](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)

* ### CVE-2022-38724 XSS in shortcodes

  Severity:
  Medium ([?](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/release_process/#security-releases))
  Identifier:CVE-2022-38724
  Versions Affected:silverstripe/framework: ^4.0.0, silverstripe/assets: ^1.0.0
  Versions Fixed:silverstripe/framework: ^4.11.13, silverstripe/assets: ^1.11.1
  Release Date:2022-11-21

  A malicious content author could add arbitrary attributes to HTML editor shortcodes which could be used to inject a JavaScript payload on the front end of the site. The shortcode providers that ship with Silverstripe CMS have been reviewed and attribute whitelists have been implemented where appropriate to negate this risk.

  Most projects should be able to apply the patch without further work. There's no legitimate use case for this behaviour. If your project includes [custom shortcode providers](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/developer_guides/extending/shortcodes/#defining-custom-shortcodes), consider reviewing them and implementing a similar whitelist when rendering the shortcodes to HTML.

  Regression testing should focus on HTML Editor functionally relying on shortcodes:

  + image insertion
  + links to CMS resources
  + media insertion
  + custom shortcodes for your project.
