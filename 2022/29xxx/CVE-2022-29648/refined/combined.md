| There is a storage XSS vulnerability in the guest TOP10 of jfinal\_cms. TOP10 will display the ip of the user, but it can be modified by X-Forwarded-For, where the attacker can insert malicious XSS code. When the administrator logs in, the malicious XSS code triggers successfully.  payload: X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.1<script>alert ("xss")</script>  In the background login interface, enter the account password randomly, fill in the correct verification code, and then submit and grab the package.
