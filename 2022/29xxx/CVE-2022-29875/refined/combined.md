**Deserialization Vulnerability in Healthcare Products**
Publication Date: 2022-05-31
Last Update: 2022-06-09
Current Version: 1.0
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

**SUMMARY**
A deserialization vulnerability is present in *syngo* which could allow an unauthenticated attacker to perform remote code execution under certain circumstances. Multiple Siemens Healthineers products use this platform and are affected by varying degrees.
Siemens Healthineers provides fixes for all affected versions and recommends specific countermeasures where fixes cannot be applied.

**WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS**
Siemens Healthineers has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* If possible, block ports 32912/tcp and 32914/tcp on an external firewall

Product specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
**Please follow the General Security Recommendations.**

**GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS**
In addition, Siemens Healthineers generally recommends the following:

* Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.
* Securely delete any backup files that are no longer needed.
* For specific patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center. To find your local contact, please refer to [https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/how-can-we-help-you](/how-can-we-help-you).

**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION**Siemens Healthineers Biograph Horizon PET/CT Systems are used in hospital environments for imaging. Siemens Healthineers MAGNETOM MRI Systems are used in hospital environments for imaging. Siemens Healthineers MAMMOMAT Revelation is a state-of-the-art digital mammography system for screening and diagnostics. Siemens Healthineers NAEOTOM Alpha is a photon-counting CT scanner. Siemens Healthineers SOMATOM CT devices are used in hospital environments for imaging. Siemens Healthineers Symbia is a family of SPECT, SPECT/CT and Post-Processing Workstation devices that are used in hospital environments for imaging. Siemens Healthineers syngo.via is a software solution intended to be used for viewing, manipulation, communication, and storage of medical images. It can be used as a stand-alone device or together with a variety of cleared and unmodified syngo based software options. syngo.via supports interpretation and evaluation of examinations within healthcare institutions, for example, in Radiology, Nuclear Medicine and Cardiology environments.

**VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION**
The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1 ([CVSS v3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/)). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring. An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at: [https://cwe.mitre.org/.](https://cwe.mitre.org/)

**Vulnerability CVE-2022-29875**
 The application deserialises untrusted data without sufficient validations that could result in an arbitrary deserialization. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute code in the affected system if ports 32912/tcp or 32914/tcp are reachable. CVSS v3.1 Base Score 9.8 CVSS Vector CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
