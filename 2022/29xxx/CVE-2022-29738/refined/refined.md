The provided content details a SQL injection vulnerability in the "Money Transfer Management System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `/mtms/admin/?page=transaction/send&id=` parameter. The application directly uses the `id` parameter in an SQL query without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database by using SQL injection techniques. In the provided example, the attacker extracts the database name.
- Potential database manipulation: While not demonstrated in this example, SQL injection could be used to modify or delete data if the database user has write privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `id` parameter in an HTTP GET request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable parameter and understand basic SQL injection techniques.
