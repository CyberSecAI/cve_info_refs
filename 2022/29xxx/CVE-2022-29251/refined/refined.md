Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29251

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet` wiki page of XWiki.
- The `newThemeName` form field's value, taken from the request parameter, is inserted into a hidden input field without proper XML escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of XML escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the `newThemeName` parameter.
- **Improper Output Neutralization:** The application fails to neutralize special characters, which allows the injection of arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies or credentials.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Modifying the content of the page viewed by the user.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network, by crafting a malicious URL.
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the `newThemeName` URL parameter of the `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet` page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with the `newThemeName` parameter containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to lure a user to visit this malicious link.
- The user needs to have at least low privileges as stated in the CVSS score.
- User interaction is required for exploitation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in XWiki versions 6.3-rc-1 and 6.2.4, and potentially other versions before the fix.
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7, and 13.10.3.
- The fix involves applying XML escaping (`$escapetool.xml()`) to the `newThemeName` parameter before rendering it in the HTML.
- A workaround is also provided, which is to manually edit the wiki page and apply the fix.
- The CVSS score is 6.8 which is considered Moderate.
- The CVSS v3 base metrics indicate that the attack complexity is low, user interaction is required, scope is changed, confidentiality is high, and integrity and availability are none.
- CWE-80 and CWE-116 are associated with this vulnerability, they respectively refer to Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) and Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output.
