The provided content includes information about CVE-2022-29050.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Publish Over FTP Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation and does not require POST requests for these methods.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to an FTP server using attacker-specified credentials.
- CSRF: The affected form validation methods do not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers can connect to an FTP server using attacker-specified credentials, potentially gaining access to sensitive data on the FTP server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Missing permission checks: Attacker sends a crafted request to trigger the validation without proper permission checks.
- CSRF: Attacker can induce a victim user to trigger the form validation by visiting a malicious webpage.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  An attacker with Overall/Read permission in Jenkins can exploit the missing permission check vulnerability.
-  An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability with a victim user visiting a malicious web page and triggering the validation.
