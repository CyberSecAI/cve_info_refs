### Potential XSS from URL and URL Table alias URLs

**Description**

The URL from a URL or URL Table type alias is not sanitized before display on `firewall_alias.php`, which can potentially lead to a stored XSS when viewing the list of aliases on the **URL** or **All** tabs.

The URL from a URL table alias is also not sanitized when included in the alias popup on various firewall and NAT rule pages, but that mechanism has its own safety measures which prevent it from being a concern there. Even so, it's best to encode it in the popup.

pfSense-SA-22\_05.webgui Security Advisory
pfSense
Topic: XSS vulnerability in the WebGUI
Category: pfSense Base System
Module: webgui
Announced: 2023-02-15
Credits: Fabien MAISONNETTE (Alstom) https://fr.linkedin.com/in/fabdotnet
Affects: pfSense Plus software versions < 22.05
pfSense CE software versions <= 2.6.0
Corrected: 2022-04-14 13:36:43 UTC (pfSense Plus master)
2022-04-14 13:36:43 UTC (pfSense CE master, 2.7.0)
2022-04-14 13:39:39 UTC (pfSense CE 2.6.0)
0. Revision History
v1.1 2023-06-19 Updated with CE 2.7.0 release information
v1.0 2023-02-15 Initial SA draft
I. Background
pfSense® software is a free network firewall distribution based on the
FreeBSD operating system. The pfSense software distribution includes third-
party free software packages for additional functionality, and provides most of
the functionality of common commercial firewalls.
pfSense® Plus is the productized version of pfSense software from Netgate®,
previously referred to as pfSense Factory Edition (FE). It is available to
Netgate appliance and CSP customers.
The majority of users of pfSense software have never installed or used a stock
FreeBSD system. Unlike similar GNU/Linux-based firewall distributions, there
is no need for any UNIX knowledge. The command line is never used, and there
is no need to ever manually edit any rule sets. Instead, pfSense software
includes a web interface for the configuration of all included components.
Users familiar with commercial firewalls will quickly understand the web
interface, while those unfamiliar with commercial-grade firewalls may encounter
a short learning curve.
II. Problem Description
A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in firewall\_aliases.php, a
component of the pfSense Plus and pfSense CE software GUI.
This problem is present on pfSense Plus version 22.05, pfSense CE version 2.6.0,
and earlier versions of both.
The page did not sanitize the contents of URL Table Alias URL parameters nor did
it encode the output when it included the value of that parameter in the page
when viewing the list of aliases on the URL or All tabs, leading to a possible
XSS.
III. Impact
Due to the lack of proper encoding on the affected parameters susceptible to
XSS, arbitrary JavaScript could be executed in the user's browser. The user's
session cookie or other information from the session may be compromised.
IV. Workaround
To help mitigate the problem on older releases, use one or more of the
following:
\* Limit access to the affected pages to trusted administrators only.
\* Do not log into the firewall with the same browser used for non-
administrative web browsing.
V. Solution
Users can upgrade to pfSense Plus software version 22.05 or later, or pfSense CE
software version 2.7.0 or later. This upgrade may be performed in the web
interface or from the console.
See https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/install/upgrade-guide.html
Users on pfSense CE version 2.6.0 may apply the fix from the recommended patches
list in the System Patches package.
Users may also manually apply the relevant revisions below using the System
Patches package on earlier versions, or by manually making similar changes to
the affected files if the patches do not apply directly.
