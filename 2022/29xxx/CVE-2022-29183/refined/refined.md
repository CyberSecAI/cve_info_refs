Impact of exploitation:
An attacker could trick a victim into executing arbitrary code, potentially allowing the attacker to operate on or gain control over resources the victim has access to.

Attack vectors:
The attack vector is network based, specifically through the pipeline comparison function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTML within a message that gets rendered via the pipeline comparison function error handling.
- User interaction is required to trigger the exploit.
- No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

Additional details:
- The vulnerability is present in GoCD versions 20.2.0 through 21.4.0 (inclusive).
- It was fixed in GoCD 21.4.0.
