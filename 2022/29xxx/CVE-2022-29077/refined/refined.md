Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the fixes included in XRP Ledger version 1.8.5, which is related to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability/Weakness:**

*   **`TaggedPointer` move constructor bug:** A typographical error in the `TaggedPointer` move constructor could lead to mishandling of cases where a caller attempts to remove a child that is not actually part of the node. This was considered a minor bug in unused code.
*   **Missing Protobuf Prerequisites:** The build scripts and packages were not properly handling Protobuf packages which could cause build failures on some systems, specifically Ubuntu 21.10.
*   **Peer Discovery Handling:** The handling of incoming messages on the peer protocol had weaknesses.
*  **Dereferencing Empty Optional:** In Reporting Mode, there was a possibility of dereferencing an empty optional value when throwing an error.
*  **Incorrect Commit ID in Version String**: When building the server from a non-tagged release, the commit ID was not being added to the version string in a manner consistent with semantic versioning standards.

**Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Potential Crash (Rare):** The `TaggedPointer` issue was a minor bug in unused code, so the potential for exploitation was very low, with no real practical impact.
*   **Build Failure:** The missing Protobuf dependencies would cause a build failure and prevent the server from being compiled.
*   **Peer Protocol Issues:** Weaknesses in handling peer protocol messages could lead to instability or other issues.
*   **Potential Crash:** The empty optional dereference in ReportingETL could result in a crash of the system.
*  **Incorrect Version String:** The inaccurate inclusion of the commit hash could lead to confusion regarding the actual version.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The `TaggedPointer` bug had no practical impact.
*   The missing Protobuf prerequisites caused a build failure, preventing the server from being compiled on specific systems.
*   Issues in peer protocol handling could lead to instability.
*   The empty optional dereference issue could cause a crash.
*  The commit ID being incorrectly included in version strings could lead to confusion for users trying to determine the correct version.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The `TaggedPointer` bug was in unused code, and not practically exploitable.
*   The Protobuf prerequisite issue was related to the build environment.
*   The peer discovery issue related to message handling could potentially be exploited by sending malformed messages.
*   The empty optional dereference vulnerability can occur during the normal execution of the software when in Reporting mode.
*   The version string vulnerability related to the build process itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The `TaggedPointer` issue requires no attacker capabilities because it was a bug in unused code and not practically exploitable.
*   The Protobuf issue requires the user to build from source, and therefore was a build issue, not an attack vector
*   The peer discovery issue requires the attacker to be able to interact with the rippled peer-to-peer network.
*   The empty optional dereference requires no direct attacker interaction but rather a condition to be met within the rippled process.
*   The version string issue requires no attacker capabilities or position, as it is a problem with the versioning scheme used during the build process.

**Summary:**

The content provides details on several fixes included in `rippled` version 1.8.5. These fixes address a range of issues from minor code bugs (`TaggedPointer`) to build issues (Protobuf prerequisites), message handling in the peer protocol, a potential dereferencing issue and how the commit ID was included in the version string. The most critical fixes include improving peer protocol handling and fixing a crash during reporting mode due to a potential dereference.

The fixes listed in the content correspond to the commits listed in the changelog for version 1.8.5 and provide more detail than the official CVE description.
