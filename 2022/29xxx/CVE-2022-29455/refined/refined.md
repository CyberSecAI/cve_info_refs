Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Elementor plugin handles user-supplied input within the lightbox module, specifically when processing video parameters. The plugin doesn't properly sanitize or validate the `videoParams` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the video element.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a DOM-based XSS, where the malicious payload is executed within the user's browser by manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) of the web page.
- **Inadequate Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the `videoParams` parameter within the lightbox module. This allows for the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes, including event handlers like `onerror`.
- **Unsafe use of jQuery:** The plugin uses JQuery to set video parameters which are coming from the user controlled parameter `videoParams`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session.
- **Cookie exfiltration:** The injected JavaScript can access and steal the victim's cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking or account takeover.
- **Account takeover:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in user, such as creating new accounts or modifying existing ones.
- **Website defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or functionality of the affected web page.
- **Phishing:** The attacker could display fake login forms or other deceptive content within the website.
- **SOAP and CORS Bypass:** The attacker could perform SOAP and CORS bypass attacks by executing malicious javascript on the victim's behalf.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Lightbox module manipulation:** The attack vector involves exploiting the lightbox feature of the Elementor plugin.
- **`settings` parameter:** The vulnerable code can be reached through the `settings` parameter in the URL, with a specific JSON payload in base64 format.
- **`videoParams` injection:** The attacker crafts a payload that injects malicious code through the `videoParams` parameter, including attributes like `onerror` to execute Javascript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Knowledge of Elementor's lightbox module:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the way Elementor uses the lightbox module and its parameters.
- **Ability to craft a malicious payload:** The attacker needs to be able to create a specifically crafted JSON payload containing the malicious code.
- **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it accessible to any visitor of a vulnerable website.
- **Target user interaction:** The exploit requires a user to interact with a crafted link containing the malicious payload, typically by clicking on it.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Elementor versions 3.5.5 and earlier.
- Elementor version 3.5.6 fixed the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Rotem Bar, Tomer Zait and Gal Nagli.
- A proof-of-concept was created demonstrating account takeover.
- The vulnerability affected over 6.5 million websites, highlighting the severity of this issue.
