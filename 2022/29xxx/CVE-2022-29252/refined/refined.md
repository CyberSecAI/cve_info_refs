Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29252:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper XML escaping of the `requestJoin` parameter in the `WikiManager.JoinWiki` page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code via this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability (CWE-79, CWE-80), specifically a reflected XSS, as the injected script is executed within the context of the user's session when they visit the vulnerable page.
*   **Improper Output Neutralization for All Web Pages (CWE-116):** The application fails to properly neutralize output before rendering it in the HTML page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Confidentiality:** An attacker could potentially steal sensitive information, such as session cookies or other data that the user can access. This is reflected in the CVSS score as "High" for Confidentiality.
*   **Integrity:** Though not the primary impact, an attacker could potentially modify the displayed content, or perform actions on behalf of the user if they can trick the user to interact with the injected script. This is reflected in the CVSS score as "None" for Integrity.
*   **Availability:**  There is no direct impact on availability. The CVSS score reflects this as "None" for Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network.
*  **User Interaction:** The vulnerability requires user interaction to be triggered as the victim has to visit the malicious link

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes the malicious payload in the `requestJoin` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting the malicious URL. This could be through social engineering, phishing, or other means.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves escaping the `requestJoin` parameter using `$escapetool.xml()` before inserting it into the HTML.
*   The vulnerability affects XWiki versions >= 5.3-milestone-2
*   Patched versions include 12.10.11, 13.4.7, 13.10.3, and 14.0-rc-1.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.4.
