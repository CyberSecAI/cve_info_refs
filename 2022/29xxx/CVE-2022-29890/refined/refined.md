- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The help sidebar in affected versions of Octopus Server allows customization to include a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload within the support link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the help sidebar, which would then be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the help sidebar. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker would need to have the ability to customize the help sidebar settings, specifically the support link, to inject malicious code. This could require administrative privileges or access depending on the system's configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to modify the help sidebar settings.
