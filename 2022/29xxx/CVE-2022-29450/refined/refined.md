Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue. The provided content does not specify the exact vulnerable functionality but indicates that the plugin's AJAX actions were lacking proper nonce validation making them susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin's AJAX actions did not sufficiently validate the origin of the requests, making them vulnerable to CSRF.
- **Missing Nonce Validation:** The plugin uses AJAX actions to perform operations, however the AJAX actions lack a proper nonce check to verify that the request came from an authorized user session. This allows an attacker to craft malicious requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could force a logged-in administrator or user to perform unintended actions on the website, such as modifying post settings, editing content, or changing plugin settings which is described as unwanted actions under their current authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious HTML page or use social engineering techniques (e.g. malicious link sent via email) to trick a logged-in administrator or user into unknowingly submitting a forged request to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attack would be triggered when a logged-in user visits the attacker's page or link while they are authenticated to the affected WordPress site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user into accessing a malicious webpage or link.
- Basic web development knowledge is required to craft the malicious HTML/JavaScript.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is in the "Admin Management Xtended" WordPress plugin.
- The vulnerable versions are 2.4.4 and earlier.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.4.5
- The commit log mentions "CSRF vulnerabilities fixed" and includes a link to the CVE.
- The patch includes changes in `general-functions.php` to add nonce verification for AJAX requests with `check_ajax_referer( 'ame_ajax_validation', 'security' );` and  `wp_localize_script` to pass the nonce. This indicates a general fix to all the plugin's AJAX functionalities.
