Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Academy-LMS application, specifically in the "SEO" settings of the course manager. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores the injected script in the database, which is then executed when other users access the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to various attacks, such as:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
    - Phishing: Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacement: Altering the appearance of the website.
    - Information theft: Accessing sensitive information within the application.
    - Keylogging: Capturing user keystrokes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Web interface: The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the web interface of the Academy-LMS application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated admin user: The attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator to access the course manager settings where the XSS payload can be injected.
- Knowledge of vulnerable parameter: The attacker needs to know the specific input field within the SEO settings where the XSS payload will be stored.

**Technical Details:**
- The exploit involves injecting the following payload: `</script><svg onload=alert();>` into the SEO settings.
- This payload, when rendered on the front-end of the course page, triggers the `onload` event on the `<svg>` tag, resulting in the execution of the `alert()` JavaScript function, demonstrating successful XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content does not contain a CVE ID for this vulnerability.
- The content indicates that this vulnerability was tested on Windows 10 and Google Chrome, suggesting that the vulnerability is client-side.
