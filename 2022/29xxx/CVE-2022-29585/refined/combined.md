## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

Group search page shows too many results when isolated institutions is turned on

Vulnerability type: Insecure permissions
Attack type: Remote
Impact: Information disclosure

Affected components: The group search, accessible via Main menu → Engage → Groups when isolated institutions is turned on for the site.

Attack vectors: If the site turned on isolated institutions and has more than 10 groups on the site, using the paginator on the 'Groups' page, someone can view the title of all groups on the site from page 2 of the results list onwards rather than only seeing groups in their own institution.

Description: Mahara before 20.10.5, 21.04.4, 21.10.2, and 22.04.0, a site using 'Isolated institutions' is vulnerable if groups are used. They are all shown from page 2 of the group results list rather than only showing groups for the institution in which the viewer is a member of.

Reported by: Can't disclose

This patch solves the problem with pagination of grouplists when isolated institutions is activated.

On second page now only the groups of the own institution are shown if the user searches for all groups.

Patch is based on mahara 20.10.4.
