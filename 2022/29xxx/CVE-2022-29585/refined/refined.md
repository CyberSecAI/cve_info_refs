Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29585:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the way Mahara handles group search results when "Isolated institutions" is enabled. Specifically, when paginating through group search results, after the first page, the system incorrectly displays groups from all institutions instead of only those belonging to the user's institution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure permissions:** The application fails to properly enforce institutional boundaries when displaying group search results, leading to unauthorized access to information.
*   **Information disclosure:** The vulnerability allows users to view the titles of groups belonging to other institutions, which they should not have access to.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to group titles from different institutions within the Mahara platform. This could potentially reveal sensitive information about groups and the institutions they belong to.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by navigating to the "Groups" page (Main menu → Engage → Groups), when "Isolated institutions" is enabled and when the site has more than 10 groups.
*   An attacker exploits the vulnerability by paginating through the group search results and accessing the second page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user of a Mahara instance with "Isolated institutions" enabled.
*   They need to have access to the "Groups" section of the site.
*   The site must have more than 10 groups for the pagination to appear.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Mahara versions prior to 20.10.5, 21.04.4, 21.10.2, and 22.04.0.
*   The issue was fixed by applying a patch that correctly filters group results on subsequent pages, ensuring that users only see groups from their own institution.
