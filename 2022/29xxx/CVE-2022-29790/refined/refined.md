Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29790:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by multi-threaded access to the database in the graphics acceleration service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  The core weakness is a lack of proper synchronization or locking mechanisms when multiple threads access the database within the graphics acceleration service. This creates a race condition or similar concurrency issue when the database is accessed by multiple threads at the same time.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can cause service exceptions. This suggests that the graphics acceleration service could crash or become unresponsive, potentially impacting system stability and the user experience.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through triggering multi-threaded access to the vulnerable database within the graphics acceleration service. The specifics of how this multi-threaded access is triggered is not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need the ability to interact with the graphics acceleration service in a way that triggers multi-threaded access to the database. It's not clear from this description whether this interaction requires elevated privileges, or is accessible to applications on the device, further information would be necessary to determine the specifics.

**Additional Notes:** The vulnerability affects EMUI 12.0.0. The provided description does not elaborate on the specific type of service exception that is triggered by successful exploitation, beyond that it will impact service operation.
