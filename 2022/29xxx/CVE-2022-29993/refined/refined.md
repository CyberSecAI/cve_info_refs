Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL Injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `/scbs/admin/bookings/view_booking.php` file, specifically the `id` parameter. The application directly incorporates the user-supplied `id` into a SQL query without any escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `id` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the query, altering its intended behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers can potentially extract sensitive data from the database, including user credentials, booking details, or any other information stored in the database.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also modify or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the application's database user privileges, it might be possible to gain elevated access to the database and potentially the server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to `/scbs/admin/bookings/view_booking.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
- **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft effective injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates using the `length(database())` function to determine the length of the database name through the injection.
- The attacker is able to use boolean based SQL injection to determine the database name by observing the Content-Length in the response.

**Payload Example:**
`/scbs/admin/bookings/view_booking.php?id=4%27%20and%20length(database())%20=7%20--+`
This payload is used to test if the length of the current database name is 7 characters.
