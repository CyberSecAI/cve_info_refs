| **1.Information** Exploit Title: IonizeCMS-V1.0.8.1-Unverified post request parameters lead to sql injection Exploit date: 11.04.2022 Exploit Author: ericfrank900528@gmail.com Vendor Homepage: <https://github.com/ionize/ionize> Affect Version: V1.0.8.1 Description: SQL injection in Ionize CMS 1.0.8.1 allows attackers to execute commands remotely via a sql injection request from client. **2.Vulnerability Description** The exploit code is located in the project's application/models/article\_model.php file In the shift\_article\_ordering method, the code is as follows. The POST parameter id\_page is spliced into the sql statement without any processing or inspection, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability. [shift_article_ordering_source](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103121115/162709755-aabacb60-d5b2-437d-bfa0-01d03835d4ff.png) **3.How to Exploit** 3.1Construct normal packet and send. In the image below, you can see that there is a 2 second network delay. [shift_article_ordering_prove1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103121115/162709136-48bb19ed-4077-4325-8282-2b6f09a4e6f8.png)  3.2Construct the injected data to execute `sleep(1)`. It can be found that the delay is more than 4 seconds. It is speculated that there are 4 records in total, so `sleep(1)` is executed 4 times. [shift_article_ordering_prove2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103121115/162709181-54b6a408-4ab4-4fb1-94a4-af3628329ea0.png)  3.3Construct the injection again to execute `sleep(3)`, this time with a delay of `2 + 4*3 = 14` seconds if the guess is correct. [shift_article_ordering_prove3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103121115/162709204-fa71d499-97c7-4c25-938b-5aaf0fa14858.png) **4.Suggestion** Validate the parameters in the post request to avoid SQL injection |
