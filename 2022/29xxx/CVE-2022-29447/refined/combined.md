# Risks

CVSS 6.8

##### 6.8

### Local File Inclusion

This could allow a malicious actor to include local files of the target website and show its output onto the screen. Files which store credentials, such as database credentials, could potentially allow complete database takeover depending on the configuration.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

This security issue has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.

![Update to version X or later](https://patchstack.com/database/img/update-checkmark.svg)
### Update to version 2.1.1 or later.

Update to version 2.1.1 or later to remove the vulnerability.
Patchstack users can turn on auto-update for vulnerable plugins only.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

* Wobble Horizontal
* Wobble Vertical
* Wobble To Bottom Right

No way to control the effects parameters, some are too exagerated and some too light/small and there’s just that single setting. Next…

The plugin is very easy to use, it is not applied to all images en masse, but you can choose a separate effect for each image. Excellent plugin! I recommend :). Thank you very much to the creator for creating it. I really appreciate it! 🙂
