Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Hover Effects plugin (<= 2.1) is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local File Inclusion (LFI). This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to include and display the contents of local files from the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could potentially access sensitive files, such as those containing database credentials.
*   If database credentials are exposed, it could lead to a complete database takeover.
*   More generally, attackers can view source code of the website or other sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not described in detail, but an LFI vulnerability is typically exploited by manipulating user input (e.g., parameters in a URL) to point to the local file system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as low priority and unlikely to be exploited, however, it still allows an attacker to read the content of arbitrary files on the server.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.1.1 of the plugin.
*   The vulnerability is classified as an "Injection" under OWASP Top 10.
