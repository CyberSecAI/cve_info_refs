The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability found in the Online Sports Complex Booking System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `view_category.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter in the URL is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any validation or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection because it does not sanitize the `id` parameter in the URL.
- Lack of Input Validation: There's no input validation or sanitization performed on the `id` parameter before it's used in the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Exposure: Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database.
- Data Modification: Attackers could modify or delete data in the database.
- Potential Server Takeover: In some cases, depending on database permissions and system configuration, an attacker might be able to execute OS commands via the SQL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains malicious SQL code within the `id` parameter in the `view_category.php` script.
    - `/scbs/admin/categories/view_category.php?id=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL parameter.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this particular vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `/scbs/admin/categories/view_category.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is `id`.
- The provided example payload demonstrates how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to determine the length of the database name: `/scbs/admin/categories/view_category.php?id=2%27%20and%20length(database())%20=7%20--+`
- The response length changes depending on if the injected conditional statement is true or false, allowing an attacker to infer the database name length.
