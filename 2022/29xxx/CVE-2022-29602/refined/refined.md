*   Defacing the website.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim within the application

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through user-provided input within the "Grid Elements" extension.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid TYPO3 backend user account.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify content using the vulnerable extension.

**Affected Versions:**
* 7.6.1 and below
* 8.0.0 - 8.7.0
