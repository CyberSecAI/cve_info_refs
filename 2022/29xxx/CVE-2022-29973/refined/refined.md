The content is related to CVE-2022-29973.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how `fuse-exfat` handles file reads when the file's `DataLength` is larger than its `ValidDataLength`. According to the exFAT specification, bytes beyond `ValidDataLength` should be treated as null bytes, but `fuse-exfat` returns remnant data that exists in the allocated clusters, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of `ValidDataLength` when reading files.
- Exposing remnant data from file system clusters that should be zeroed out.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker can read potentially sensitive, deleted data from the file system which was previously allocated to the file but not zeroed out.
- This can lead to the exposure of user data, secrets, or other confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must have access to an exFAT volume mounted using the vulnerable `fuse-exfat` driver.
- The attacker needs to read a file with `DataLength` greater than `ValidDataLength` to expose the remnant data.
- Unprivileged users may be able to exploit this vulnerability if they have access to mount the exFAT volume.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to mount and read files from an exFAT volume using the vulnerable `fuse-exfat` driver.
- Knowledge of how to create files with `DataLength` larger than `ValidDataLength` to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found in versions 1.3.0 and the latest code (at the time of reporting) of `fuse-exfat`
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.0 of `fuse-exfat`
- The issue is caused by `fuse-exfat` not respecting the `ValidDataLength` field when reading a file, resulting in the disclosure of remnant data that may have been present in the clusters beyond `ValidDataLength`
