# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

1. Redact SSH key from URL query parameter when printing the URL after a download error happens.
2. Changed redaction from `xxxxx` to `redacted`.

| Thanks [@macedogm](https://github.com/macedogm)!  Doesn't look like any HashiCorp tooling calls `RedactURL` directly, and we don't universally guarantee error string backward compatibility, so this seems safe to merge from a compatibility standpoint. Code looks good too! |

[![Go Documentation](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/33ba3040de50c02959ac64f0d6d9a4bab7a3e27ca3f2e2ea667f8daa9f2200a3/687474703a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f62616467652f676f2d646f63756d656e746174696f6e2d626c75652e7376673f7374796c653d666c61742d737175617265)](http://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-getter)

go-getter is a library for Go (golang) for downloading files or directories
from various sources using a URL as the primary form of input.

The power of this library is being flexible in being able to download
from a number of different sources (file paths, Git, HTTP, Mercurial, etc.)
using a single string as input. This removes the burden of knowing how to
download from a variety of sources from the implementer.

The concept of a *detector* automatically turns invalid URLs into proper
URLs. For example: "github.com/hashicorp/go-getter" would turn into a
Git URL. Or "./foo" would turn into a file URL. These are extensible.

This library is used by [Terraform](https://terraform.io) for
downloading modules and [Nomad](https://nomadproject.io) for downloading
binaries.

## Installation and Usage

Package documentation can be found on
[GoDoc](http://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-getter).

Installation can be done with a normal `go get`:

```
$ go get github.com/hashicorp/go-getter

```

go-getter also has a command you can use to test URL strings:

```
$ go install github.com/hashicorp/go-getter/cmd/go-getter
...

$ go-getter github.com/foo/bar ./foo
...

```

The command is useful for verifying URL structures.

## Security

Fetching resources from user-supplied URLs is an inherently dangerous operation and may
leave your application vulnerable to [server side request forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server_Side_Request_Forgery),
[path traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal), [denial of service](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Denial_of_Service)
or other security flaws.

go-getter contains mitigations for some of these security issues, but should still be used with
caution in security-critical contexts. See the available [security options](#Security-Options) that
can be configured to mitigate some of these risks.

go-getter may return values that contain caller-provided query parameters that can contain sensitive data.
Context around what parameters are and are not sensitive is known only by the caller of go-getter, and specific to each use case.
We recommend the caller ensure that go-getter's return values (e.g., error messages) are properly handled and sanitized to ensure
sensitive data is not persisted to logs.

## URL Format

go-getter uses a single string URL as input to download from a variety of
protocols. go-getter has various "tricks" with this URL to do certain things.
This section documents the URL format.

### Supported Protocols and Detectors

**Protocols** are used to download files/directories using a specific
mechanism. Example protocols are Git and HTTP.

**Detectors** are used to transform a valid or invalid URL into another
URL if it matches a certain pattern. Example: "github.com/user/repo" is
automatically transformed into a fully valid Git URL. This allows go-getter
to be very user friendly.

go-getter out of the box supports the following protocols. Additional protocols
can be augmented at runtime by implementing the `Getter` interface.

* Local files
* Git
* Mercurial
* HTTP
* Amazon S3
* Google GCP

In addition to the above protocols, go-getter has what are called "detectors."
These take a URL and attempt to automatically choose the best protocol for
it, which might involve even changing the protocol. The following detection
is built-in by default:

* File paths such as "./foo" are automatically changed to absolute
  file URLs.
* GitHub URLs, such as "github.com/mitchellh/vagrant" are automatically
  changed to Git protocol over HTTP.
* GitLab URLs, such as "gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape" are automatically
  changed to Git protocol over HTTP.
* BitBucket URLs, such as "bitbucket.org/mitchellh/vagrant" are automatically
  changed to a Git or mercurial protocol using the BitBucket API.

### Forced Protocol

In some cases, the protocol to use is ambiguous depending on the source
URL. For example, "<http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant.git>" could reference
an HTTP URL or a Git URL. Forced protocol syntax is used to disambiguate this
URL.

Forced protocol can be done by prefixing the URL with the protocol followed
by double colons. For example: `git::http://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant.git`
would download the given HTTP URL using the Git protocol.

Forced protocols will also override any detectors.

In the absence of a forced protocol, detectors may be run on the URL, transforming
the protocol anyways. The above example would've used the Git protocol either
way since the Git detector would've detected it was a GitHub URL.

### Protocol-Specific Options

Each protocol can support protocol-specific options to configure that
protocol. For example, the `git` protocol supports specifying a `ref`
query parameter that tells it what ref to checkout for that Git
repository.

The options are specified as query parameters on the URL (or URL-like string)
given to go-getter. Using the Git example above, the URL below is a valid
input to go-getter:

```
github.com/hashicorp/go-getter?ref=abcd1234

```

The protocol-specific options are documented below the URL format
section. But because they are part of the URL, we point it out here so
you know they exist.

### Subdirectories

If you want to download only a specific subdirectory from a downloaded
directory, you can specify a subdirectory after a double-slash `//`.
go-getter will first download the URL specified *before* the double-slash
(as if you didn't specify a double-slash), but will then copy the
path after the double slash into the target directory.

For example, if you're downloading this GitHub repository, but you only
want to download the `testdata` directory, you can do the following:

```
https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter.git//testdata

```

If you downloaded this to the `/tmp` directory, then the file
`/tmp/archive.gz` would exist. Notice that this file is in the `testdata`
directory in this repository, but because we specified a subdirectory,
go-getter automatically copied only that directory contents.

Subdirectory paths may also use filesystem glob patterns. The path must
match *exactly one* entry or go-getter will return an error.
This is useful if you're not sure the exact directory name but it follows
a predictable naming structure.

For example, the following URL would also work:

```
https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter.git//test-*

```

### Checksumming

For file downloads of any protocol, go-getter can automatically verify
a checksum for you. Note that checksumming only works for downloading files,
not directories, but checksumming will work for any protocol.

To checksum a file, append a `checksum` query parameter to the URL. go-getter
will parse out this query parameter automatically and use it to verify the
checksum. The parameter value can be in the format of `type:value` or just
`value`, where type is "md5", "sha1", "sha256", "sha512" or "file" . The
"value" should be the actual checksum value or download URL for "file". When
`type` part is omitted, type will be guessed based on the length of the
checksum string. Examples:

```
./foo.txt?checksum=md5:b7d96c89d09d9e204f5fedc4d5d55b21

```

```
./foo.txt?checksum=b7d96c89d09d9e204f5fedc4d5d55b21

```

```
./foo.txt?checksum=file:./foo.txt.sha256sum

```

When checksumming from a file - ex: with `checksum=file:url` - go-getter will
get the file linked in the URL after `file:` using the same configuration. For
example, in `file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/cosmic/MD5SUMS` go-getter will
download a checksum file under the aforementioned url using the http protocol.
All protocols supported by go-getter can be used. The checksum file will be
downloaded in a temporary file then parsed. The destination of the temporary
file can be changed by setting system specific environment variables: `TMPDIR`
for unix; `TMP`, `TEMP` or `USERPROFILE` on windows. Read godoc of
[os.TempDir](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#TempDir) for more information on the
temporary directory selection. Content of files are expected to be BSD or GNU
style. Once go-getter is done with the checksum file; it is deleted.

The checksum query parameter is never sent to the backend protocol
implementation. It is used at a higher level by go-getter itself.

If the destination file exists and the checksums match: download
will be skipped.

### Unarchiving

go-getter will automatically unarchive files into a file or directory
based on the extension of the file being requested (over any protocol).
This works for both file and directory downloads.

go-getter looks for an `archive` query parameter to specify the format of
the archive. If this isn't specified, go-getter will use the extension of
the path to see if it appears archived. Unarchiving can be explicitly
disabled by setting the `archive` query parameter to `false`.

The following archive formats are supported:

* `tar.gz` and `tgz`
* `tar.bz2` and `tbz2`
* `tar.xz` and `txz`
* `zip`
* `gz`
* `bz2`
* `xz`

For example, an example URL is shown below:

```
./foo.zip

```

This will automatically be inferred to be a ZIP file and will be extracted.
You can also be explicit about the archive type:

```
./some/other/path?archive=zip

```

And finally, you can disable archiving completely:

```
./some/path?archive=false

```

You can combine unarchiving with the other features of go-getter such
as checksumming. The special `archive` query parameter will be removed
from the URL before going to the final protocol downloader.

## Protocol-Specific Options

This section documents the protocol-specific options that can be specified for
go-getter. These options should be appended to the input as normal query
parameters ([HTTP headers](#headers) are an exception to this, however).
Depending on the usage of go-getter, applications may provide alternate ways of
inputting options. For example, [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io) provides a
nice options block for specifying options rather than in the URL.

## General (All Protocols)

The options below are available to all protocols:

* `archive` - The archive format to use to unarchive this file, or "" (empty
  string) to disable unarchiving. For more details, see the complete section
  on archive support above.
* `checksum` - Checksum to verify the downloaded file or archive. See
  the entire section on checksumming above for format and more details.
* `filename` - When in file download mode, allows specifying the name of the
  downloaded file on disk. Has no effect in directory mode.

### Local Files (`file`)

None

### Git (`git`)

* `ref` - The Git ref to checkout. This is a ref, so it can point to
  a commit SHA, a branch name, etc. If it is a named ref such as a branch
  name, go-getter will update it to the latest on each get.
* `sshkey` - An SSH private key to use during clones. The provided key must
  be a base64-encoded string. For example, to generate a suitable `sshkey`
  from a private key file on disk, you would run `base64 -w0 <file>`.

  **Note**: Git 2.3+ is required to use this feature.
* `depth` - The Git clone depth. The provided number specifies the last `n`
  revisions to clone from the repository.

The `git` getter accepts both URL-style SSH addresses like
`git::ssh://git@example.com/foo/bar`, and "scp-style" addresses like
`git::git@example.com/foo/bar`. In the latter case, omitting the `git::`
force prefix is allowed if the username prefix is exactly `git@`.

The "scp-style" addresses *cannot* be used in conjunction with the `ssh://`
scheme prefix, because in that case the colon is used to mark an optional
port number to connect on, rather than to delimit the path from the host.

### Mercurial (`hg`)

* `rev` - The Mercurial revision to checkout.

### HTTP (`http`)

#### Basic Authentication

To use HTTP basic authentication with go-getter, simply prepend `username:password@` to the
hostname in the URL such as `https://Aladdin:OpenSesame@www.example.com/index.html`. All special
characters, including the username and password, must be URL encoded.

#### Headers

Optional request headers can be added by supplying them in a custom
[`HttpGetter`](https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#HttpGetter)
(*not* as query parameters like most other options). These headers will be sent
out on every request the getter in question makes.

### S3 (`s3`)

S3 takes various access configurations in the URL. Note that it will also
read these from standard AWS environment variables if they're set. S3 compliant servers like Minio
are also supported. If the query parameters are present, these take priority.

* `aws_access_key_id` - AWS access key.
* `aws_access_key_secret` - AWS access key secret.
* `aws_access_token` - AWS access token if this is being used.
* `aws_profile` - Use this profile from local ~/.aws/ config. Takes priority over the other three.

#### Using IAM Instance Profiles with S3

If you use go-getter and want to use an EC2 IAM Instance Profile to avoid
using credentials, then just omit these and the profile, if available will
be used automatically.

### Using S3 with Minio

If you use go-gitter for Minio support, you must consider the following:

* `aws_access_key_id` (required) - Minio access key.
* `aws_access_key_secret` (required) - Minio access key secret.
* `region` (optional - defaults to us-east-1) - Region identifier to use.
* `version` (optional - defaults to Minio default) - Configuration file format.

#### S3 Bucket Examples

S3 has several addressing schemes used to reference your bucket. These are
listed here: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-bucket-intro.html>

Some examples for these addressing schemes:

* s3::<https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/foo>
* s3::<https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bucket/foo>
* bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/foo
* bucket.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/foo/bar
* "s3::<http://127.0.0.1:9000/test-bucket/hello.txt?aws_access_key_id=KEYID&aws_access_key_secret=SECRETKEY&region=us-east-2>"

### GCS (`gcs`)

#### GCS Authentication

In order to access to GCS, authentication credentials should be provided. More information can be found [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started)

#### GCS Bucket Examples

* gcs::<https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/bucket>
* gcs::<https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/bucket/foo.zip>
* [www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/bucket/foo](http://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/bucket/foo)

#### GCS Testing

The tests for `get_gcs.go` require you to have GCP credentials set in your environment. These credentials can have any level of permissions to any project, they just need to exist. This means setting `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="~/path/to/credentials.json"` or `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS="{stringified-credentials-json}"`. Due to this configuration, `get_gcs_test.go` will fail for external contributors in CircleCI.

### Security Options

**Disable Symlinks**

In your getter client config, we recommend using the `DisableSymlinks` option,
which prevents writing through or copying from symlinks (which may point outside the directory).

```
client := getter.Client{
    // This will prevent copying or writing files through symlinks
    DisableSymlinks: true,
}
```

**Disable or Limit `X-Terraform-Get`**

Go-Getter supports arbitrary redirects via the `X-Terraform-Get` header. This functionality
exists to support [Terraform use cases](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/sources#http-urls),
but is likely not needed in most applications.

For code that uses the `HttpGetter`, add the following configuration options:

```
var httpGetter = &getter.HttpGetter{
    // Most clients should disable X-Terraform-Get
    // See the note below
    XTerraformGetDisabled: true,
    // Your software probably doesn’t rely on X-Terraform-Get, but
    // if it does, you should set the above field to false, plus
    // set XTerraformGet Limit to prevent endless redirects
    // XTerraformGetLimit: 10,
}
```

**Enforce Timeouts**

The `HttpGetter` supports timeouts and other resource-constraining configuration options. The `GitGetter` and `HgGetter`
only support timeouts.

Configuration for the `HttpGetter`:

```
var httpGetter = &getter.HttpGetter{
    // Disable pre-fetch HEAD requests
    DoNotCheckHeadFirst: true,

    // As an alternative to the above setting, you can
    // set a reasonable timeout for HEAD requests
    // HeadFirstTimeout: 10 * time.Second,

    // Read timeout for HTTP operations
    ReadTimeout: 30 * time.Second,

    // Set the maximum number of bytes
    // that can be read by the getter
    MaxBytes: 500000000, // 500 MB
}
```

For code that uses the `GitGetter` or `HgGetter`, set the `Timeout` option:

```
var gitGetter = &getter.GitGetter{
    // Set a reasonable timeout for git operations
    Timeout: 5 * time.Minute,
}
```

```
var hgGetter = &getter.HgGetter{
    // Set a reasonable timeout for hg operations
    Timeout: 5 * time.Minute,
}
```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.
