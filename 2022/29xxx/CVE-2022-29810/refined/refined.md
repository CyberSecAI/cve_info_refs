{
  "cveId": "CVE-2022-29810",
  "description": "The Hashicorp go-getter library before 1.5.11 could write SSH credentials into its logfile, exposing sensitive credentials to local users able to read the logfile.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The go-getter library was not sanitizing SSH credentials from the URL before writing it to the log file.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File"
    ],
    "impact": "Exposure of sensitive SSH credentials to local users who have access to the log files. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and resources.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local access to log files."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker needs to have read access to the log files where the go-getter library logs information.",
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered when the go-getter library encounters a download error and logs the URL, including the SSH key present in the query parameters of the URL. The fix redacts the SSH key from the URL before logging it, replacing the key with the string 'redacted'."
