Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `singer_Singer.php_del` functionality of the Cscms music portal system v4.2.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id` parameter when deleting a singer, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- The vulnerable parameter is 'id' in the POST request to `/admin.php/singer/admin/singer/del`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database, which is demonstrated by the example query to get the database name: `select database()`.
    - Modify data within the database.
    - Potentially gain unauthorized access to the system if the database user has sufficient privileges.
- The example provided demonstrates blind SQL injection with the use of `sleep()` to verify the vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `/admin.php/singer/admin/singer/del` endpoint.
- The attacker injects SQL code in the `id` parameter.
- The application receives the malicious SQL payload.
- The application executes the crafted SQL query against the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as an administrator to add and delete a singer.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application with a crafted payload in the `id` parameter in POST request.
- They need knowledge of the application's structure to determine the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a sample request with a malicious payload demonstrating how the SQL injection can be exploited. The example uses `sleep(5)` for verification.
- It also shows how to use a query to verify the database name using blind SQL injection by comparing the first character of the database name to 'C'.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `singer_Singer.php_del` functionality.
