Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the Online Sports Complex Booking System v1.0.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user input provided through the `id` parameter in the `/scbs/admin/categories/manage_category.php` URL, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerability. This occurs when user-supplied data is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent malicious SQL code from being injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Information Disclosure:** The attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Potential Data Manipulation:** While not explicitly demonstrated in the provided content, SQL injection can potentially allow an attacker to modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Full Database Takeover:** With further exploitation, a complete compromise of the database and potentially the entire system could be achieved.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the `/scbs/admin/categories/manage_category.php` endpoint.
*   **`id` Parameter:** The malicious SQL code is injected through the `id` parameter within the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Knowledge of SQL:** Basic knowledge of SQL is needed to craft the injection payloads.
*   **Targeted URL:** The attacker needs to know the URL to the vulnerable page `/scbs/admin/categories/manage_category.php`

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided example payload `2' and length(database()) =7 --+` shows how to inject SQL code into the `id` parameter. By varying the numerical value in `length(database()) = X`, the attacker can determine the database name length. In the example, a difference in response length can be seen when testing for `length(database()) = 6` and `length(database()) = 7`
*   The current database name is `scbs_db`, and the content shows how to leak the database name length.
* The SQL injection occurs because of a lack of proper input sanitization of the `id` parameter on the `/scbs/admin/categories/manage_category.php` page.
* The attacker can use this vulnerability to extract information from the database.

This information provides a clear picture of the SQL injection vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
