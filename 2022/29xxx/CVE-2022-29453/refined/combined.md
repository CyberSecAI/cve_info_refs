How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

Retroactively add Google Maps API KEY to any theme or plugin.

Simply activate, go to Settings>Google API KEY and enter your key.

The plugin will then attempt to add this key to all the places it is needed on the front of your website.

NOTE: this will only work if the Google API has been added as per WordPress standards)

Since January 2023 Google Maps JavaScript API requires callback parameter. This plugin also fixes JavaScript Error: [Loading the Google Maps JavaScript API without a callback is not supported](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/url-params#required_parameters).

The plugin was created by the GeoDirectory team: <https://wpgeodirectory.com>

followed the easy instructions and checked on the mapfix.dev page and says it can’t find api key or api calls but there is no help to fix it, so not sure what this plugin is supposed to do.

We’ve had an issue with a particular theme having something wrong with their theme settings, which resulted in the section for the API key missing. I installed this plugin and it did the job.
Super easy and quick!
