Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection, making it susceptible to malicious requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The plugin doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to potentially trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (like administrators) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication. This could include changing the Google Maps API key, potentially disrupting the website's functionality or injecting malicious content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that targets the vulnerable functionality in the plugin. This could be delivered through a malicious link, a compromised website, or social engineering.
- The victim would need to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site with the necessary privileges to make changes to the plugin settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious HTTP request that the victim's browser will unknowingly execute.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to perform the action by making them click a malicious link or visiting a malicious page

**Additional Notes:**

- The Patchstack content notes that the vulnerability has low severity and is unlikely to be exploited.
- The WordPress.org plugin page changelog confirms that version 1.2.2 addresses the CSRF vulnerability by restricting API key updates to users with "manage_options" capability which is default for Admin users.
