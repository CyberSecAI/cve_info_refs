Thought I‚Äôd check out this plugin, installed it, entered my data and all I see is a 404 error üôÇ

### [I seriously doubt why this plugin is even admitted in the repository](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-seriously-doubt-why-this-plugin-is-even-admitted-in-the-repository/)

November 6, 2022

What can I say?
The plugin totally does not work on 8.0 and on 7.4 when I have the error reporting on ‚Äòfull scale‚Äô, it produces more ‚Äòdeprecated‚Äô warnings and general notifications than HTML output.
JavaScript conflicts with numerous other plugins and CSS uses very generic names conflicting with other even standard WordPress class names.
Nice try, but the creator of this plugin was clearly coding in a vacuum assuming that his plugin would be the only plugin somebody would ever need.
Don‚Äôt waste your time with this amateuristic attempt to make a plugin!

This plugin works fine as he promised, but have the worst html I‚Äôve ever seen.
All classes have a generic name, css customizations are impossible.

### [Worst code quality ever](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/worst-code-quality-ever/)

[tunnelso](https://profiles.wordpress.org/tunnelso/ "Posts by tunnelso")
May 10, 2018

Sorry to say but html outputs from this plugin have the worst code quality I‚Äôve ever seen. Everything have same class, no way to select specific element to apply custom css. If they want to apply 10px height, they have a class for that. Background white, another class for that and bla bla bla.
This is the way this plugin shows button:
<a style="border:2px solid #78635a; color:#78635a;" href=".." class="nd\_booking\_padding\_15\_30\_important nd\_options\_second\_font\_important nd\_booking\_border\_radius\_0\_important nd\_booking\_background\_color\_transparent\_important nd\_booking\_cursor\_pointer nd\_booking\_display\_inline\_block nd\_booking\_font\_size\_11 nd\_booking\_font\_weight\_bold nd\_booking\_letter\_spacing\_2" target="\_self">BOOK NOW FROM 25 $</a>
Every element have same classes but not a single unique class to identify what the element is. This makes it impossible to customize elements

Excellent, but missing possibility to set up accommodation for children. For example: Room for two adults + one child (free).

# Risks

CVSS 4.1

##### 4.1

### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

This could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website which will be executed when guests visit your site.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

This security issue has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.

![Update to version X or later](https://patchstack.com/database/img/update-checkmark.svg)
### Update to version 3.3 or later.

Update to version 3.3 or later to remove the vulnerability.
Patchstack users can turn on auto-update for vulnerable plugins only.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
