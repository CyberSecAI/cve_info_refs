Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29547:

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the MediaWiki `CreateRedirect` extension, which had insufficient permissions checks. Specifically, it allowed users to move a page, such as the Main Page, even if they didn't have the necessary edit permissions for that page. This was possible via the extension's special page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authorization:** The primary vulnerability was the lack of proper authorization checks within the `CreateRedirect` extension. This allowed users to perform actions (specifically page moves) without having the required permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Page Manipulation:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to move pages they don't have the proper permissions to edit.
*  **Potential for Disruptive Actions:** In the case described, an attacker used this to move the Main Page, which could be disruptive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*  The attack vector is through the `CreateRedirect` extension's functionality, specifically its special page.
* An attacker could move pages without having proper edit permissions.
*  The attacker was an anonymous, globally blocked user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needed to be able to access a wiki using the vulnerable version of the CreateRedirect extension.
*   The attacker did not need any elevated privileges, as the vulnerability was in bypassing edit permissions. In fact, the vulnerability could be triggered by a globally blocked user.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by an LTA (Long-Term Abuser) who was also globally blocked. This suggests that the vulnerability could be exploited by low-privilege users.
*   The issue was fixed in this commit: [https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/CreateRedirect/+/780567](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/mediawiki/extensions/CreateRedirect/%2B/780567).
*   There was a discussion to possibly replace the vulnerable extension with an alternative (`RedirectManager`) after a security review.
*   The issue was initially misattributed to `GlobalBlocking` extension, but further investigation narrowed it down to the `CreateRedirect` extension.
