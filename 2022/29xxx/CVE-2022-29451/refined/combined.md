How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

Do you love the demos of the themes made by Rara Theme? Or, need a guideline for setting up the themes?

Then, all you need is this plugin!

Rara One Click Demo Import plugin will help you import the demo content, including settings of the widgets and the customizer, with a click.

The demo content will make your website look like the preview of a theme so that you get a basic guideline for making your website.

Once installed and activated, Rara One Click Demo Import will be accessible through **Appearance > Rara Demo Import**.

If you use Premium themes made by Rara Themes, go to Pro Theme Demo Import tab and just click on ‘Import Now’ button and your website will look like the demo of the activated theme in no time.

If you use free themes made by Rara Themes, download the demo files from your [Theme Documentation](https://rarathemes.com/documentation/) page, upload it using ‘Upload Demo File’ button on this plugin, and click Import Now. As simple as that.

You can find the detail documentation [here](https://rarathemes.com/blog/import-demo-content-rara-themes/)

If you need help, contact our support team [here](https://rarathemes.com/support-ticket/).

This plugin is based on the ‘Theme Demo Import’ plugin by Themely, https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-demo-import/

As well as the improved WP Import 2.0 plugin by @humanmade, https://github.com/humanmade/WordPress-Importer.

Download the plugin from WordPress.org repository

On your WordPress admin dashboard, go to ‘Plugins> Add New> Upload Plugin’.

Upload the downloaded plugin file (rara-one-click-demo-import.zip) and click ‘Install Now’

## FAQ

### I have activated the Rara One Click Demo Import plugin. Where can I find the plugin?

You will find the plugin in *wp-admin -> Appearance -> Rara Demo Import*.

### Where are the demo import files and the log files saved?

The files used in the demo import will be saved to the default WordPress uploads directory. An example of that directory would be: `../wp-content/uploads/2017/03/`.

The log file will be registered in the *wp-admin -> Media* section.

### I can’t activate the plugin because of a fatal error. What can I do?

*Update: There is an admin error notice, stating that the minimal PHP version required for this plugin is 5.3.2.*

You want to activate the plugin, but this error shows up:

*Plugin could not be activated because it triggered a fatal error*

This happens because your hosting server is using a very old version of PHP. This plugin requires PHP version of at least **5.3.x**, but we recommend version *5.6.x*. Please contact your hosting company and ask them to update the PHP version for your site.

I recently downloaded the Rara Travel Theme which installed fine. Even though I had read other peoples reviews stating the import does not work. I can state it worked fine for me first time. I am running the latest version of Wordpress as of 25/07/18 with WooCommerce and so far so good no issues. I have even created a Child Theme just in case of future Theme Updates. So don’t believe these 1 Star reviews. I am relatively new to Wordpress and I managed just fine.
Thank You to the programmer who wrote the Theme and provided the Demo Content all for Free by the way. Really! Thank You!
