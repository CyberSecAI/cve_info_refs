Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-29155

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the `back-sql` backend of OpenLDAP. This backend allows OpenLDAP to store data in a SQL database. The vulnerability exists because user-supplied input within LDAP search filters is not properly sanitized when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. Maliciously crafted LDAP search filters can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the queries executed against the backend database.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `back-sql` backend failed to properly escape or sanitize user-provided filter data before incorporating it into SQL queries. Specifically, single quotes (') were not correctly handled.
- **Insecure String Concatenation:** The code directly concatenated user input into SQL queries without using prepared statements or parameterized queries, which could prevent SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially use SQL injection to extract sensitive data stored in the SQL database.
- **Data Modification/Addition:** Attackers can modify or add data to the database, leading to potential corruption or unauthorized changes.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting resource-intensive SQL queries or modifying/deleting data, an attacker could cause the database or the LDAP server to become unavailable.
- **Data Deletion:**  As demonstrated by the provided exploit example, attackers could delete data from the database by injecting `DELETE` statements.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **LDAP Search Filters:** The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted LDAP search filters provided by the attacker through an LDAP client. This means the attacker interacts with the LDAP server, not directly with the database.
- **Network:** The attack can be launched over a network using a standard LDAP client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable OpenLDAP server.
- **Basic LDAP knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of LDAP and how search filters work.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- **Understanding of back-sql:** The attacker must have some understanding of how back-sql works to craft a SQL injection payload.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OpenLDAP versions 2.x prior to 2.5.12 and 2.6.x prior to 2.6.2.
- The provided information includes a detailed explanation of how the vulnerability can be exploited, including an example of deleting data from a database using a malicious filter.
- Patches were developed to address this vulnerability by properly escaping user-provided filter data before incorporating it into SQL queries (doubling single quotes).
- The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate OpenLDAP and are vulnerable. The advisory specifies the affected products and products not affected.
- The Debian Security Advisories (DSA 5140-1 and DLA 3017-1) confirm the SQL injection vulnerability in the `back-sql` backend to `slapd` in OpenLDAP and provide updated packages to fix the issue.
- The original bug report on bugs.openldap.org details the SQL injection vulnerability and the steps taken to fix it.
- One comment in the bug report suggests using `SQLPrepare` to prevent this type of vulnerability, indicating that this approach was not initially taken.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jacek Konieczny from Axeos.
- The fix involves escaping filter values, particularly the single quote character.
