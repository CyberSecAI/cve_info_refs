I just upgraded to PHP 8.0 from 7.4 and when I did, this plugin caused the site to go down with a critical error. When I disable the plugin, everything is fine.

### [Pro versions doesn’t work](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pro-versions-doesnt-work/)

[Percipero](https://profiles.wordpress.org/sudwebdesign/ "Posts by Percipero")

Installation instructions require a manual upload into the backend of wordpress and they say “Please download archive and install it on your wordpress website in plugin management section. This plugin enable full set of premium features in plugin.”
Being a reasonably well versed WP developer, I presume this means into the 2j-slideshow plugin directory.
1) You shouldn’t need to ftp a file onto your site to get a license working
2) They should give clear step by step instructions. The FAQ on their website goes to an error page
No reply from my support ticket after 24hrs. My client is getting impatient.
Time to get a refund and find another plugin. This is a WASTE OF MY TIME and why I decided to go for a Pro version in the first place!
!! AVOID !!

So I bought the premium version of this plugin but I never received the product/license. They just took my money and said bye.
I’ve contacted them 24 hours ago but have yet to receive a reply.
I really hope I don’t get scammed. Will update this review when there are any updates.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
