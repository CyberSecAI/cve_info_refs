The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Sports Complex Booking System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `delete_category` function within the `Master.php` file. Specifically, the `id` parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without any form of escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The system is vulnerable to SQL injection, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database compromise: An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- Information disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive information such as database names, user credentials, and other confidential data.
- System compromise: In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain control of the underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/scbs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_category`.
- The `id` parameter in the POST request is used as the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- Network access to the vulnerable application is required, although the application appears to be used locally on a private network.
