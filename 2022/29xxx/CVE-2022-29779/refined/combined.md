This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed Array.prototype.slice() with slow "this" argument.

```
Previously, when "this" argument was not a fast array, but the "deleted" array
was a fast array, the "deleted" array may be left in uninitialized state if
"this" argument had gaps.

This fix is to ensure that "deleted" is properly initialized.

This fixes [#485](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/485) issue on Github.
