  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an unquoted service path in the MiniTool Partition Wizard software.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Unquoted service path"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can gain elevated privileges by placing a malicious executable in a folder within the unquoted service path. When the service starts, it will execute the malicious code instead of the intended executable.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Local file system manipulation"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
    "Local user account with write access to a folder in the unquoted service path"
