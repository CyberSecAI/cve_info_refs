Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-29043:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Mask Passwords Plugin, along with multiple other plugins, fails to properly escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses:**
-  Insufficient input sanitization.
-  Lack of output escaping of parameter names and descriptions.

**Impact:**
- An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- When a user views pages that list these parameters, such as the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages (if not hardened) the injected script executes within their browser.
- This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions that the attacker could perform as the victim user.

**Attack Vector:**
- An attacker with `Item/Configure` permission modifies a parameter's name or description to include malicious JavaScript code.
- The injected script is stored persistently.
- The injected script executes when a user with access views a page that displays the configured parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
-  The attacker needs `Item/Configure` permission in Jenkins.
-  The attacker needs to craft malicious JavaScript code to inject.
- The attacker's payload will be displayed in pages where job parameters are displayed.

**Affected Plugin:**
- Mask Passwords Plugin versions 3.0 and earlier.

**Fix:**
- Mask Passwords Plugin should be updated to version 3.1 or later.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided text indicates that this vulnerability is part of a larger class of vulnerabilities affecting several plugins in a similar way.
- Jenkins core has implemented mitigations for its own "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since version 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.
- Some plugins have been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation, while others (like "Coordinator Plugin", "Show Build Parameters Plugin", and "Unleash Maven Plugin") have not.
- The advisory emphasizes that plugins defining parameter types are the ones vulnerable to this issue.
