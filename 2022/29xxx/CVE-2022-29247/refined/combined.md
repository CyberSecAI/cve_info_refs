# Compromised child renderer processes could obtain IPC access without nodeIntegrationInSubFrames being enabled

Moderate

[MarshallOfSound](/MarshallOfSound)
published
GHSA-mq8j-3h7h-p8g7
Jun 13, 2022

## Package

npm

electron
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 15.5.5 || >= 16.0.0-beta.1 < 16.2.6 || >= 17.0.0-beta.1 < 17.2.0 || >= 18.0.0-beta.1 < 18.0.0-beta.6

## Patched versions

15.5.5, 16.2.6, 17.2.0, 18.0.0-beta.6

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows a renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows effective access to `ipcRenderer`.

Please note the misleadingly named `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` option does not implicitly grant Node.js access rather it depends on the existing `sandbox` setting. If your application is sandboxed then `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed renderer APIs (which includes `ipcRenderer`).

If your application then additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user even with the sandbox enabled.

### Patches

This has been patched and the following Electron versions contain the fix:

* `18.0.0-beta.6`
* `17.2.0`
* `16.2.6`
* `15.5.5`

### Workarounds

Ensure that all IPC message handlers appropriately validate `senderFrame` as per our [security tutorial here](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/main/docs/tutorial/security.md#17-validate-the-sender-of-all-ipc-messages).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
