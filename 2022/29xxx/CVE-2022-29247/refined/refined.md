- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A compromised child renderer process can gain access to a new renderer process with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled. This, in turn, allows access to `ipcRenderer`, potentially leading to further compromise if IPC messages are not properly validated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Incorrect handling of `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` setting.
    - Lack of proper IPC message sender validation, specifically `senderFrame` validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - A compromised renderer process gains access to `ipcRenderer`.
    - If the application doesn't validate IPC message senders, attackers can perform privileged actions or access confidential data by exploiting exposed IPC messages. This can compromise the application and user, even with sandbox enabled.
- **Attack vectors:** A compromised renderer process can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to compromise a renderer process to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    - Requires that a new renderer process is opened with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled
    - The vulnerable application must be exposing IPC messages without validating `senderFrame`.
