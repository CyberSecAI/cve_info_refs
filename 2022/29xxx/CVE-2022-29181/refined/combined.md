## 1.13.6 / 2022-05-08

### Security

* [CRuby] Address [CVE-2022-29181](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29181), improper handling of unexpected data types, related to untrusted inputs to the SAX parsers. See [GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/security/advisories/GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m) for more information.

### Improvements

* `{HTML4,XML}::SAX::{Parser,ParserContext}` constructor methods now raise `TypeError` instead of segfaulting when an incorrect type is passed.

| [Description](#c0)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 09:57:04 UTC  ``` Just version update. In release-1.4.txt is a note that xfs-related things need updates. Was trivial, just renaming the ebuild, changing download-location and S-var. You need to mask >=sys-apps/xfsprogs-20020124   Shall I do this with the other xfs-related things as well? (acl, attr, dmapi, xfsdump) ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 09:57:31 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4256](attachment.cgi?id=4256 "xfsprogs-2.0.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=4256&action=edit "xfsprogs-2.0.3.ebuild")] xfsprogs-2.0.3.ebuild ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Brad Cowan (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:12:37 UTC  ``` Sounds great :) go ahead and submit them. I'll mask them, as to my knowledge they depend on specific kernel patches too correct? THX ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:31:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4259](attachment.cgi?id=4259 "xfsprogs-2.0.3.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=4259&action=edit "xfsprogs-2.0.3.ebuild")] xfsprogs-2.0.3.ebuild  Better use this one (changed download-location to a more permanent one as they might remove it from the latest-dir soon) ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:38:50 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4260](attachment.cgi?id=4260 "acl-2.0.18.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=4260&action=edit "acl-2.0.18.ebuild")] acl-2.0.18.ebuild ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:40:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4261](attachment.cgi?id=4261 "attr-2.0.9.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=4261&action=edit "attr-2.0.9.ebuild")] attr-2.0.9.ebuild ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:40:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4262](attachment.cgi?id=4262 "dmapi-2.0.5.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=4262&action=edit "dmapi-2.0.5.ebuild")] dmapi-2.0.5.ebuild ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:41:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 4263](attachment.cgi?id=4263 "xfsdump-2.1.5.ebuild") [[details](attachment.cgi?id=4263&action=edit "xfsdump-2.1.5.ebuild")] xfsdump-2.1.5.ebuild ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 12:42:07 UTC  ``` Okay, here come the other xfs-stuff updates. if they should go into portage as default, don't forget to mask the date-versioned ebuilds.  ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Brad Cowan (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 14:25:27 UTC  ``` seems as though there's a xfsprogs-2.2.2 and 2.0.3 isn't in the current dir just in the lastest dir  ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Brad Cowan (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-09-27 15:06:17 UTC  ``` Ok updated to xfsprogs-2.2.2 and commited the packages are now masked for testing THX  ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Alessandro Pisani    2002-10-03 06:23:04 UTC  ``` They doesn't work fine for me actually: acl,attr,dmapi and xfsprogs will create wrong links on filesystem, causing xfsdump to be unable to compile.  in example: output of  ls -l /usr/lib/*attr*  lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           56 Oct  3 13:16 libattr.a -> /var/tmp/portage/attr-2.0.9/image//usr/libexec/libattr.a lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           57 Oct  3 13:16 libattr.la -> /var/tmp/portage/attr-2.0.9/image//usr/libexec/libattr.la lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           12 Oct  3 13:16 libattr.so -> libattr.so.1 lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root           16 Oct  3 13:16 libattr.so.1 -> libattr.so.1.0.1 -rw-r--r--    1 root     root        10542 Oct  3 13:16 libattr.so.1.0.1  the same happen for dmapi and acl and xfsprogs: all libraries links are wrong.  Bye, Alessandro ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Brad Cowan (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-06 01:24:15 UTC  ``` I totally reworked these ebuilds as they were horribly out of date....hopefully I fixed the simlinks :)  ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  Alessandro Pisani    2002-10-06 04:02:26 UTC  ``` confirmed: symlinks are now okay. thank you :)  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Brad Cowan (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-10-11 16:43:29 UTC  ``` now masked by new arch testing keywords, please read the following to unmask: Another important snippet. If you want to unmask all ~x86 KEYWORDSed ebuilds, add the following to your /etc/make.conf:  ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86"  ACCEPT_KEYWORDS is incremental like USE so it *will* keep the existing "x86" that is defined in your profile. This can also be done using the environment for temporary testing purposes:  # export ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~x86" (or "~ppc" or "~sparc", etc.) ``` |  |

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your account on GitHub as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

# Improper Handling of Unexpected Data Type in Nokogiri

High

[flavorjones](/flavorjones)
published
GHSA-xh29-r2w5-wx8m
May 8, 2022

## Package

bundler

Nokogiri
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 1.13.6

## Patched versions

1.13.6

## Description

### Summary

Nokogiri `< v1.13.6` does not type-check all inputs into the XML and HTML4 SAX parsers. For CRuby users, this may allow specially crafted untrusted inputs to cause illegal memory access errors (segfault) or reads from unrelated memory.

### Severity

The Nokogiri maintainers have evaluated this as **High 8.2** (CVSS3.1).

### Mitigation

CRuby users should upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.6`.

JRuby users are not affected.

### Workarounds

To avoid this vulnerability in affected applications, ensure the untrusted input is a `String` by calling `#to_s` or equivalent.

### Credit

This vulnerability was responsibly reported by [@agustingianni](https://github.com/agustingianni) and the Github Security Lab.

# GHSL-2022-031\_GHSL-2022-032: Type confusion in Nokogiri leads to memory leak or DoS - CVE-2022-29181

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102623)
Agustin Gianni](https://github.com/agustingianni)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2022-05-05: Maintainers contacted via their `h1` program
* 2022-05-07: Maintainers fixed the issues and released an advisory

## Summary

Two type confusion issues while processing malicious data can be used to leak the contents of memory or cause a denial-of-service.

## Product

Nokogiri

## Tested Version

[v1.13.4](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/releases/tag/v1.13.4)

## Details

### Issue 1: Type confusion in `xml_sax_parser_context.c` (`GHSL-2022-031`)

An attacker who controls the kind of object passed into the `parse_memory` function can provide an object that is not a ruby string, for example an integer. Since an integer is an immediate value and not a pointer to an object, the process will crash while trying to read from an invalid memory address.

In the snippet bellow, the function `RSTRING_LEN` is used without checking that the type of the object `data` is `T_STRING`. Typically the object type is checked using `Check_Type(data, T_STRING)`, but in this case, no checks are performed.

*Snippet from [xml\_sax\_parser\_context.c#L68](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/4e59b2cba036ea101ecd1c4297e10a17b4bf2c2a/ext/nokogiri/xml_sax_parser_context.c#L68):*

```
/*
 * call-seq:
 *  parse_memory(data)
 *
 * Parse the XML stored in memory in +data+
 */
static VALUE
parse_memory(VALUE klass, VALUE data)
{
  xmlParserCtxtPtr ctxt;

  if (NIL_P(data)) {
    rb_raise(rb_eArgError, "data cannot be nil");
  }

  // NOTE: (1)
  if (!(int)RSTRING_LEN(data)) {
    rb_raise(rb_eRuntimeError, "data cannot be empty");
  }

  ctxt = xmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt(StringValuePtr(data),
                                   (int)RSTRING_LEN(data));
  if (ctxt->sax) {
    xmlFree(ctxt->sax);
    ctxt->sax = NULL;
  }

  return Data_Wrap_Struct(klass, NULL, deallocate, ctxt);
}

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to DoS or Information Disclosure.

#### Resources

The following ruby proof of concept will crash the process by dereferencing the address `0xcafecafe`.

```
require "nokogiri"
parser = Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Parser.new
parser.parse 0xcafecafe >> 1

```

*Output from an `irb` session:*

```
irb(main):003:0> require "nokogiri"
=> true
irb(main):004:0>  parser = Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Parser.new
=> #<Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Parser:0x0000000108d90518 @document=#<Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Document:0x0000000108d90478>, @encoding="UTF-8", @warned=false>
irb(main):005:0> parser.parse 0xcafecafe >> 1
/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/3.1.0/gems/nokogiri-1.13.4-arm64-darwin/lib/nokogiri/xml/sax/parser.rb:111: [BUG] Segmentation fault at 0x00000000cafecaff
ruby 3.1.2p20 (2022-04-12 revision 4491bb740a) [arm64-darwin21]

```

In order to leak information about the address space in which nokogiri is running, an attacker can repeatedly crash the server by trying addresses until the remote server does not crash, therefore indicating that the supplied value is a valid memory address.

If nokogiri is being used in a way which reflects the results of the parsing to the attacker, this vulnerability can be used to leak arbitrary ruby strings which may contain secrets that the attacker should not have access to. In order to do this an attacker has to guess the address of the target string in memory.

### Issue 2: Type confusion in `html4_sax_parser_context.c` (`GHSL-2022-032`)

An identical vulnerability can be found in the `html4` version of the parser.

[html4\_sax\_parser\_context.c#L25](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/blob/4e59b2cba036ea101ecd1c4297e10a17b4bf2c2a/ext/nokogiri/html4_sax_parser_context.c#L25)

```
static VALUE
parse_memory(VALUE klass, VALUE data, VALUE encoding)
{
  htmlParserCtxtPtr ctxt;

  if (NIL_P(data)) {
    rb_raise(rb_eArgError, "data cannot be nil");
  }
  if (!(int)RSTRING_LEN(data)) {
    rb_raise(rb_eRuntimeError, "data cannot be empty");
  }

  ctxt = htmlCreateMemoryParserCtxt(StringValuePtr(data),
                                    (int)RSTRING_LEN(data));
  if (ctxt->sax) {
    xmlFree(ctxt->sax);
    ctxt->sax = NULL;
  }

  if (RTEST(encoding)) {
    xmlCharEncodingHandlerPtr enc = xmlFindCharEncodingHandler(StringValueCStr(encoding));
    if (enc != NULL) {
      xmlSwitchToEncoding(ctxt, enc);
      if (ctxt->errNo == XML_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ENCODING) {
        rb_raise(rb_eRuntimeError, "Unsupported encoding %s",
                 StringValueCStr(encoding));
      }
    }
  }

  return Data_Wrap_Struct(klass, NULL, deallocate, ctxt);
}

```
