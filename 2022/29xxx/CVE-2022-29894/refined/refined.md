Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the file upload functionality of Strapi.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79): This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the server and executed when a user views the affected page or content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the web browser of a user logged into the Strapi application with administrative privileges. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies.
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive data within the application.
    - Defacement: Modifying the appearance or content of the application.
    - Further attacks: Launching other attacks against the application or its users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the file upload functionality. An attacker uploads a file containing malicious script. When a user views the uploaded file or a page where the filename is displayed, the script will be executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to upload files through the Strapi application's upload feature. This generally requires at least a low privileged user account.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Strapi versions v3.x.x and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Strapi v4.x.x.
-  Strapi v3.x.x was planned to be end-of-life in September 2022.
-  The CVSS v3 score is 5.4 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N), indicating a moderate severity vulnerability with network attack vector, low attack complexity, low privileges required, user interaction needed, a changed scope, and low confidentiality and integrity impact.
- The CVSS v2 score is 3.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N), indicating a lower severity vulnerability.
