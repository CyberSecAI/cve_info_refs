{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The macros used for assertions (e.g., `CHECK_LT`, `CHECK_GT`) in TensorFlow had incorrect logic when comparing `size_t` and `int` values, leading to type conversion issues that would cause incorrect triggering of the assertions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Incorrect type conversion",
        "Incorrect implementation of comparison macros"
    ],
    "impact": "A type confusion vulnerability leading to a denial of service by triggering a `CHECK` failure that terminates the program.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when an integer and size_t are compared in the comparison macro used by the tensorflow code, causing the check to fail due to type conversion, leading to a crash.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to supply inputs to the tensorflow code such that the comparison macro that's used compares an integer and a `size_t` value, and it results in a condition that triggers the check failure.",
