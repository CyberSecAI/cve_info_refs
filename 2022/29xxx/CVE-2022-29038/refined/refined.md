Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-29038:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Extended Choice Parameter Plugin, along with multiple other plugins, does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of proper output escaping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with Item/Configure permission could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected parameter lists on pages like "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters". This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attacker needs to configure a job with a crafted parameter name or description in the Extended Choice Parameter Plugin.  This malicious parameter is then displayed on pages that list parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permission within the Jenkins environment.  They need to be able to create or modify jobs that use the vulnerable plugin.  They also need a victim to view a page where the malicious parameter is rendered.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Extended Choice Parameter Plugin version 346.vd87693c5a\_86c and earlier.
- While Jenkins core has implemented mitigations for the most commonly used parameter listing pages like "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" since versions 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2, there might be other custom pages or plugins that list parameters that could still be vulnerable.
- At the time of publication of the advisory, there was no fix available for the Extended Choice Parameter Plugin.
