- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ContentsManager` in the notebook server, when configured with `allow_hidden = False`, only prevented listing the contents of hidden directories, not accessing individual hidden files or files within hidden directories if their names were known or guessable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insufficient access control for hidden files. While directory listing was prevented, direct access to hidden files was not blocked.
    - The vulnerability allows access to files that are intended to be disallowed based on the `allow_hidden` setting.

-  **Impact of exploitation**:
    -  Exposure of sensitive files if the server's root directory contains hidden files meant to be protected by being hidden (e.g., `~/.ssh`).
    -  Unintended means of accessing files by authenticated users.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Direct, authenticated requests to the notebook server by specifying the full path of the hidden file.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Authenticated access to the notebook server.
    - Knowledge or ability to guess the names of the hidden files.
