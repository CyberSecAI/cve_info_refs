# Observable Timing Discrepancy in totp-rs

Moderate

[constantoine](/constantoine)
published
GHSA-8vxv-2g8p-2249
May 9, 2022

## Package

cargo

totp-rs
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<1.1.0

## Patched versions

1.1.0

## Description

### Impact

Token comparison was not constant time, and could theorically be used to guess value of an TOTP token, and thus reuse it in the same time window. The attacker would have to know the password beforehand nonetheless.

### Patches

Library now used constant-time comparison.

### Workarounds

No.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [totp-rs](https://github.com/constantoine/totp-rs)
* Email us at cleo.rebert@gmail.com

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-29185

### **[gleb-chipiga](/gleb-chipiga)** commented [Apr 24, 2022](#issue-1213575914)

| Currently, a simple string comparison in the `check` method is used to validate the token. To resist timing-attack, we need to use constant time comparison algorithm. Details <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack>. |
