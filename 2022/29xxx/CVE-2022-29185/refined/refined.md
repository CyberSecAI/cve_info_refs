Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from the usage of a simple string comparison in the `check` method of the `totp-rs` library for validating TOTP tokens. This method was vulnerable to timing attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Timing Attack Vulnerability:** The primary weakness was the non-constant time comparison used for token validation. This allowed an attacker to potentially discern information about the correct token by measuring the time it took to perform comparisons against various candidate tokens.
- **CWE-208:** The vulnerability is classified under CWE-208, which refers to "Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially guess the value of a TOTP token by observing timing discrepancies during the token comparison process.
- If successful, the attacker could reuse the guessed TOTP token within the same time window, effectively bypassing the TOTP authentication mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- **Timing Analysis:** The primary attack vector involves measuring the time taken for token comparisons. This allows the attacker to infer information about the correctness of the guessed token character by character.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of the Password/Secret:**  The attacker needs to know the password or secret used to generate the TOTP token beforehand.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to interact with the system performing the TOTP verification.
- **Timing Measurement Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to accurately measure the time taken for the token comparison operation.
- **High Privileges (PR:H):** The CVSS score indicates that high privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction (UI:R):** The CVSS score indicates that some user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was mitigated in version 1.1.0 of the `totp-rs` library by using constant-time comparison for token validation.
- The issue was reported by `gleb-chipiga` in issue #13 on the `totp-rs` GitHub repository.
- The severity was considered moderate.
- The CVSS base score is 4.2.
