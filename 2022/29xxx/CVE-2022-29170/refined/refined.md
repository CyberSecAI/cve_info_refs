    "CVE-2022-29170": {
        "summary": "Grafana Enterprise datasource network restrictions bypass via HTTP redirects. This vulnerability allows to bypass these security configurations if a malicious datasource (running on an allowed host) returns an HTTP redirect to a forbidden host.",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how Grafana Enterprise handles HTTP redirects when the 'Request security allow list' is enabled. It blindly follows the redirects, potentially leading to bypass of datasource network restrictions.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
            "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
            "Bypass of datasource network restrictions",
             "Disclosure of secure information to the clients."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could bypass configured datasource network restrictions, potentially accessing forbidden hosts and getting access to sensitive information.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "A malicious datasource running on an allowed host returns an HTTP redirect to a forbidden host.",
             "Exploitation via HTTP redirects."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create or modify a data source to return HTTP redirects.",
         "affected_versions": [
          "Grafana Enterprise 7.4.0-beta1 to 8.5.2",
            "All Grafana Enterprise instances with 7.4.0-beta1 - 8.5.2 versions are affected by this vulnerability."

             "Grafana Enterprise 7.5.16",
              "Grafana Enterprise 8.5.3"
         ],
         "additional_information": "The vulnerability is only impacting Grafana Enterprise when the 'Request security allow list' is used and there is a possibility to add a custom datasource to Grafana which returns HTTP redirects."
