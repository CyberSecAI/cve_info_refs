  "summary": "The provided content discusses Intent-Based Networking (IBN) and the INTENDER fuzzing framework for discovering vulnerabilities in IBN implementations, specifically focusing on the ONOS network operating system. It details the challenges of finding semantic bugs in IBN, which are not easily detected by traditional fuzzing tools. The content mentions CVE-2022-24109 as an example of an exploitable semantic vulnerability discovered using INTENDER. However, it also explicitly mentions that INTENDER discovered 12 bugs and assigned 11 CVE's. Therefore it does relate to CVE-2022-29604.",
