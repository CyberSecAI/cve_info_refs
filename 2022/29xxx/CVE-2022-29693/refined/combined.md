| Hi :)  When we used unexpected architecture such as `0`, there was a memory leak in unicorn2.  PoC  ``` int main(int argc, char **argv) {     uc_engine *uc;     uc_err err;      /* Initialize emulator in X86-64bit mode */     err = uc_open(0, UC_MODE_64, &uc);          if (err == UC_ERR_OK) {         printf("Failed on uc_open() with error returned: %u\n", err);         printf("%s\n", uc_strerror(err));         return -1;     }      if (err == UC_ERR_ARCH) {         printf("Failed on uc_open() with error returned: %u\n", err);         printf("%s\n", uc_strerror(err));     }       uc_close(uc);     return 0; } ```  If we don't use `uc_close(uc)`, there will be a memory leak.  ``` $ ./poc_test Failed on uc_open() with error returned: 2 Invalid/unsupported architecture (UC_ERR_ARCH)  ================================================================= ==22499==ERROR: LeakSanitizer: detected memory leaks                                                                                                                             Direct leak of 14720 byte(s) in 1 object(s) allocated from:     #0 0x7f2082fde037 in __interceptor_calloc ../../../../src/libsanitizer/asan/asan_malloc_linux.cpp:154                       #1 0x7f2081bddfce in uc_open /home/lys/Documents/my/unicorn/uc.c:236     #2 0x563051f0b278 in main /home/lys/Documents/unitest/poc_test.c:17     #3 0x7f20816a47ec in __libc_start_main ../csu/libc-start.c:332  SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: 14720 byte(s) leaked in 1 allocation(s).  ```  If we use `uc_close(uc)`, there will be a segmentation fault!  ``` $ ./poc_test Failed on uc_open() with error returned: 2 Invalid/unsupported architecture (UC_ERR_ARCH) AddressSanitizer:DEADLYSIGNAL ================================================================= ==22535==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x00000000075d (pc 0x7f5eb03ee46b bp 0x7ffe556843e0 sp 0x7ffe556843c0 T0)                                                                                                                    ==22535==The signal is caused by a READ memory access.                                                                      ==22535==Hint: address points to the zero page.     #0 0x7f5eb03ee46b in uc_close /home/lys/Documents/my/unicorn/uc.c:412     #1 0x5573d73fb32d in main /home/lys/Documents/unitest/poc_test.c:30     #2 0x7f5eafeb47ec in __libc_start_main ../csu/libc-start.c:332     #3 0x5573d73fb119 in _start (/home/lys/Documents/unitest/poc_test+0x1119)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.
