- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected devices do not properly handle uploaded files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can store an XSS attack. When a legitimate user accesses the error logs, the attacker's malicious script can execute arbitrary actions in the name of the user. This could lead to unauthorized access to data or functionality.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via the web interface, specifically by uploading a file containing malicious code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated to upload the malicious file. The attacker also relies on a legitimate user accessing the error logs where the injected XSS is executed.
