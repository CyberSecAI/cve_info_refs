How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Description

This plugin will add a page called “Export All URLs” under Tools. You can navigate there and can extract data from your site. You can export Posts:

* ID
* Title
* URL
* Categories
* Tags
* Author
* Published Date

The data can be filtered by post type, post status, date range, and author before extraction, and the plugin also provides the option to export using a specific post range.

### When we need this plugin?

* To check all URLs of your website
* During migration
* During security audit
* Need to share All URLs with SEO guy
* 301 Redirects handling using htaccess

### Customizable Features

* Filter by Author
* Filter by Date Range
* Exclude domain URL (very helpful in comparing results after migration)
* Set post range (very beneficial in case of timeout/memory out error)
* Generates CSV file name randomly (sensitive data protection for security reasons)
* Set preferred CSV file name (provides more control)

#### System requirements

* PHP version 5.4 or higher

## FAQ

### About Plugin Support?

Post your question on support forum and we will try to answer your question as quick as possible.

### Why did you make this plugin?

We couldn’t find a plugin that would export all URLs, titles and categories in a simplest possible way. So, we decided to take step further to fill this gap.

### Why the file name is randomly generated?

Exporting a file with a static name makes it easier for malicious attackers to discover, potentially leading to the leakage of sensitive information. Therefore, we chose to generate random names, which are more difficult to guess. Nonetheless, the plugin offers full control over the file name if needed.

### Can I delete generated CSV file?

Yes, absolutely. It is highly recommended, once the file is generated, there is a direct link to delete the generated file.

### Does Export All URLs make changes to the database?

No, the plugin does not interact with the database, as it does not have any settings or configurations to store.

### How can I check out if the plugin works for me?

Install and activate. Go to Tools / Export All URLs. Select all options and download CSV file.

### Which PHP version do I need?

This plugin has been tested and works with PHP versions 5.4 and greater. WordPress itself [recommends using PHP version 7.3 or greater](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/). If you’re using a PHP version lower than 5.4 please upgrade your PHP version or contact your Server administrator.

### Are there any known incompatibilities?

Nope, there were some issues in past, but they were fixed in version 4.0.

### Are there any server requirements?

Yes. The plugin requires a PHP version 5.4 or higher and WordPress version 3.1.0 or higher.

Works well!
A few suggestions:
Show the primary category off each post.
Show if a page or post is cornerstone?
Dropdown list with all titles

I often use this to get a specific list of URLs from the site and then use xlookup in Google Sheets to compare it with Google Search Console data or other data sources. This is a huge time saver thank you for the plugin.

Exactly what I was looking for. A simple plugin that could download page titles and urls to help me manage a large list of redirects. Love that you can display the list inside the dashboard too. Makes it much easier than toggling back n forth between google sheets. Nice UI too. Clean, modern and simple. Thank you!
