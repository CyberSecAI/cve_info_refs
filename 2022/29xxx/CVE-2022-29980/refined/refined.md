The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Simple-Client-Management-System v1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to unsanitized input being used in a SQL query within the `/cms/admin/?page=user/manage_user` endpoint. Specifically, the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Database information disclosure: Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including the database name.
- Potential for further compromise: Successful exploitation of the SQLi could allow an attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database. It can also be leveraged to escalate the attack with techniques such as out-of-band data retrieval and code injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attacker crafts a malicious GET request to the vulnerable endpoint `/cms/admin/?page=user/manage_user`, specifically targeting the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable application.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
- Basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.
