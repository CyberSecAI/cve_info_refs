## About Apple security updates

For our customers' protection, Apple doesn't disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until an investigation has occurred and patches or releases are available. Recent releases are listed on the [Apple security updates](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201222) page.

Apple security documents reference vulnerabilities by [CVE-ID](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) when possible.

**Description:**

Multiple plugins do not escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide:

* Credentials Plugin 1111.v35a\_307992395 and earlier (SECURITY-2690 / CVE-2022-29036)
* CVS Plugin 2.19 and earlier (SECURITY-2700 / CVE-2022-29037)
* Extended Choice Parameter Plugin 346.vd87693c5a\_86c and earlier (SECURITY-2704 / CVE-2022-29038)
* Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.35.2 and earlier (SECURITY-2703 / CVE-2022-29039)
* Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.15 and earlier (SECURITY-2699 / CVE-2022-29040)
* Jira Plugin 3.7 and earlier (SECURITY-2691 / CVE-2022-29041)
* Job Generator 1.22 and earlier (SECURITY-2263 / CVE-2022-29042)
* Mask Passwords Plugin 3.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2701 / CVE-2022-29043)
* Node and Label parameter Plugin 1.10.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2702 / CVE-2022-29044)
* promoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db\_d64130 and earlier (SECURITY-2692 / CVE-2022-29045)
* Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2698 / CVE-2022-29046)

This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation.
Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the [SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601](/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions) fix.
Additionally, the following plugins have been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default.

* [Maven Release Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release) 0.16.3 (SECURITY-2669)
* [Pipeline: Build Step Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-build-step) 2.17 and 2.15.2 (SECURITY-2611)
* [Pipeline: Input Step Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-input-step) 447.v95e5a\_6e3502a\_ and 2.12.1 (SECURITY-2674)

### Untrusted users can modify some Pipeline libraries in Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin

**SECURITY-1951
/
CVE-2022-29047**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-cps-global-lib`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps-global-lib)**

**Description:**

Multibranch Pipelines by default limit who can change the Pipeline definition from the Jenkinsfile.
This is useful for SCMs like GitHub:
Jenkins can build content from users without commit access, but who can submit pull requests, without granting them the ability to modify the Pipeline definition.
In that case, Jenkins will just use the Pipeline definition in the pull request’s destination branch instead.

In Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 564.ve62a\_4eb\_b\_e039 and earlier the same protection does not apply to uses of the `library` step with a `retriever` argument pointing to a library in the current build’s repository and branch (e.g., `library(â¦, retriever: legacySCM(scm))`).
This allows attackers able to submit pull requests (or equivalent), but not able to commit directly to the configured SCM, to effectively change the Pipeline behavior by changing the library behavior in their pull request, even if the Pipeline is configured to not trust them.

Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 566.vd0a\_a\_3334a\_555 and 2.21.3 aborts library retrieval if the library would be retrieved from the same repository and revision as the current build, and the revision being built is untrusted.

### CSRF vulnerability in Subversion Plugin

**SECURITY-2075
/
CVE-2022-29048**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`subversion`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion)**

**Description:**

Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier does not require POST requests for several form validation methods, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

Subversion Plugin 2.15.4 requires POST requests for the affected form validation methods.

### Promotion names in promoted builds Plugin are not validated when using Job DSL

**SECURITY-2655
/
CVE-2022-29049**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`promoted-builds`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/promoted-builds)**

**Description:**

promoted builds Plugin provides dedicated support for defining promotions using [Job DSL Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl).

promoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db\_d64130 and earlier does not validate the names of promotions defined in Job DSL.
This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to create a promotion with an unsafe name.
As a result, the promotion name could be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) or to replace other `config.xml` files.

promoted builds Plugin 876.v99d29788b\_36b\_ and 3.10.1 validates the name of promotions.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Publish Over FTP Plugin

**SECURITY-2321
/
CVE-2022-29050 (CSRF), CVE-2022-29051 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`publish-over-ftp`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/publish-over-ftp)**

**Description:**

Publish Over FTP Plugin 1.16 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an FTP server using attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

Publish Over FTP Plugin 1.17 requires POST requests and appropriate permissions for the affected form validation methods.

### Private key stored in plain text by Google Compute Engine Plugin

**SECURITY-2045
/
CVE-2022-29052**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-compute-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-compute-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.3.8 and earlier stores private keys unencrypted in cloud agent `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

These private keys can be viewed by users with Agent/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Google Compute Engine Plugin 4.3.9 stores private keys encrypted.
