Due to insufficient input validation, SAP NetWeaver Development Infrastructure (Design Time Repository) - versions 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject script into the URL and execute code in the user’s browser. On successful exploitation, an attacker can view or modify information causing a limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of the application.
