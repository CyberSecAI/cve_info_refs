- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Mono_Loader.dll` library has an integer overflow condition when parsing specially crafted TG4 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can crash the application, causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a specially crafted TG4 file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TG4 file to a user of the vulnerable software.
