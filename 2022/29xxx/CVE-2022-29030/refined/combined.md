SSA-553086: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JT2Go and
Teamcenter Visualization

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

SUMMARY

Siemens has released updates for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple ﬁle parsing
vulnerabilities. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle (crafted as CGM, TIFF or TG4) with any of the
affected products, this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens has released updates for some of the affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products
where updates are not yet available.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT2Go is a 3D JT viewing tool to allow users to view JT, PDF, Solid Edge, PLM XML with available JT,
VFZ, CGM, and TIF data.

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
