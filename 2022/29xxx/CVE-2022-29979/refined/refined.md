The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Simple Client Management System v1.0 by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input, specifically the `id` parameter in the `/cms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_designation` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. In the provided example, the attacker is able to extract the database name and user.
- This can lead to:
  - Data exfiltration, modification or deletion.
  - Potential privilege escalation.
  - Complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is accessible through an HTTP POST request to `/cms/classes/Master.php?f=delete_designation`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication seems to be explicitly required in the described attack.
