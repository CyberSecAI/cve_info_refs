  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GOST engine did not correctly process the passed buffer size when creating a key transport blob, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer overrun can occur in TLS clients when using the GOST engine, specifically when the TLS_GOSTR341112_256_WITH_KUZNYECHIK_CTR_OMAC ciphersuite is negotiated, and the server utilizes 512-bit GOST secret keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered during the TLS handshake when the client receives and processes a key transport blob from the server.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to act as a server and negotiate a vulnerable ciphersuite (TLS_GOSTR341112_256_WITH_KUZNYECHIK_CTR_OMAC) while using a 512-bit GOST secret key."
