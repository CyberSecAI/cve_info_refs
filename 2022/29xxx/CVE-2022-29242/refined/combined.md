# Buffer overrun on creating key transport blob

Moderate

[beldmit](/beldmit)
published
GHSA-2rmw-8wpg-vgw5
May 23, 2022

## Package

GOST engine
(openssl)

## Affected versions

< 3.0.1

## Patched versions

3.0.1

## Description

### Impact

TLS clients using GOST engine when ciphersuite TLS\_GOSTR341112\_256\_WITH\_KUZNYECHIK\_CTR\_OMAC is agreed and server uses 512 bit GOST secret keys are vulnerable to buffer overrun.

### Patches

Users should update GOST engine to version 3.0.1

### Workarounds

Disabling ciphersuite TLS\_GOSTR341112\_256\_WITH\_KUZNYECHIK\_CTR\_OMAC is a possible workaround

### References

[RFC 9189](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9189.html) specifies 2 variants of GOST key wrap into blob in section 4.2.4. Both of them require the same approach for checking the passed values. OpenSSL passes a big enough buffer in case of the variant described in 4.2.4.2 but not enough buffer in case of 4.2.4.1.

See also OpenSSL upstream PR [openssl/openssl#18381](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/18381)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [GOST engine repo](https://github.com/gost-engine/engine)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-29242

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

[`b2b4d62`](/gost-engine/engine/commit/b2b4d629f100eaee9f5942a106b1ccefe85b8808)

GOST engine didn't process the passed buffer size on making key blob correctly. It caused buffer overflow in client in case when server had 512-bit keys and KUZNYECHIK-based ciphersuite was in use.
