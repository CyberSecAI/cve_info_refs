Low

[antobinary](/antobinary)
published
GHSA-3mr9-p9gw-cf33

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.2, <2.3.18, <2.4-rc-1

Patched on BigBlueButton [2.3.18](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/releases/tag/v2.3.18) and higher.

### Workarounds

### References

Patched on BigBlueButton 2.4 [#13117](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/pull/13117)

### Release name

In case an administrator does not want to update to the latest bionic-240 version, use as substitute to the `-v` argument in bbb-install.sh command
