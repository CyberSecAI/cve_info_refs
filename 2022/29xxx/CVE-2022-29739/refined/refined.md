  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter of the /mtms/admin/?page=user/manage_user page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection (SQLi)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. The provided example demonstrates the ability to determine the length of the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the HTTP GET request to the '/mtms/admin/?page=user/manage_user' page, specifically manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special position or privilege is mentioned."
