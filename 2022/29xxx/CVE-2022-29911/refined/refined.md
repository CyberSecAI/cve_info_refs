{
  "CVE-2022-29911": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "An improper implementation of the new iframe sandbox keyword `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability allows script execution in a sandboxed iframe, even when the `allow-scripts` directive is not present. The `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation` keyword, when combined with `allow-same-origin`, allows the embedded document to execute script in the context of the parent document when users click on a javascript URL. This bypasses the intended sandbox restrictions.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of the parent document, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the user's browsing session. Specifically, a sandboxed iframe could execute scripts even if the `allow-scripts` directive is not present. This allows for XSS attacks and potentially more.",
     "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page with a sandboxed iframe that leverages the vulnerable implementation of the `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation` keyword. By including a javascript URL in the iframe, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the parent context.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to inject or control the content of an iframe on a target website. This could be achieved through various means, such as XSS vulnerabilities in the target website or by hosting a malicious site that the victim visits. User interaction (clicking a link) is required to trigger the vulnerability."
