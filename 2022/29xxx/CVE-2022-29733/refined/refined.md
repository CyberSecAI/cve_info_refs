Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application transmits and stores sensitive user authentication credentials (username and password) in cleartext within an HTTP cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** Sensitive information is sent over the network without encryption.
- **Cleartext Storage:** The sensitive data is stored in a cookie without proper encryption or hashing.
- **Insecure Cookie Handling**:  The cookie itself is not flagged as secure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  An attacker can intercept the cookie and gain access to user credentials.
- **Security Bypass:** Once the credentials are obtained, an attacker can impersonate a legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to the building automation system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A remote attacker can intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the enteliTOUCH device.
- **Local Network Interception**: An attacker with local network access can sniff traffic to retrieve the cookie information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic, either through a MitM attack or through local network access.
- **Packet Capture Tools:** The attacker would use packet capture tools (e.g. Wireshark) to intercept network traffic and identify the cookie containing the credentials.
- **Knowledge of HTTP Cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to identify and extract the relevant cookie data to gain access to the building automation system.

**Additional Notes:**
- Multiple versions of the enteliTOUCH software are affected.
- The vendor was contacted but did not respond, prompting a public release of the vulnerability information.
- The vulnerability is considered to have a risk rating of 3/5.
