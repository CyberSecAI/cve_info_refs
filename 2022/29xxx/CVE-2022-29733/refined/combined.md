Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Exposure of Sensitive Information, Security Bypass

Risk: (3/5)

##### Summary

enteliTOUCH - Touchscreen Building Controller. Get instant
access to the heart of your BAS. The enteliTOUCH has a 7-inch,
high-resolution display that serves as an interface to your building.
Use it as your primary interface for smaller facilities or as an
on-the-spot access point for larger systems. The intuitive,
easy-to-navigate interface gives instant access to manage your BAS.
