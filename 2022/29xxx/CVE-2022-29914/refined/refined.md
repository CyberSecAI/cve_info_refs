Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-29914:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the re-use of existing pop-up windows. When a pop-up window is created with a specific `windowName`, subsequent calls to `window.open` with the same `windowName` would reuse the existing window instead of creating a new one. This behavior, combined with the `requestFullscreen` API, allowed a reused popup to overlap the fullscreen notification UI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of window reuse: The browser did not properly check for user activation when reusing a popup, allowing it to gain focus and overlap the fullscreen UI.
- Lack of user activation check: When reusing an existing pop-up, the browser doesn't check if there is a valid user activation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Browser spoofing: An attacker could potentially create a fake fullscreen UI, tricking the user into thinking they are interacting with a legitimate page.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  A malicious website opens a popup with a specific `windowName`.
2.  The malicious site uses the `requestFullscreen` method to trigger the full-screen notification.
3. The malicious website then calls `window.open` with the same `windowName` which reuses the original window.
4. The reused pop-up window is then able to overlap the fullscreen notification, potentially spoofing the UI.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code on a website visited by the victim.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger `window.open` and `requestFullscreen` API calls.
