- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read via an uninitialized pointer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into opening a malicious file using the vulnerable software. This could be done via social engineering techniques such as email phishing.
