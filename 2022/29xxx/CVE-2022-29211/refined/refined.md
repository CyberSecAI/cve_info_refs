{
  "CVE-2022-29211": {
    "Description": "The implementation of `tf.histogram_fixed_width` is vulnerable to a crash when the values array contains `NaN` elements. The implementation assumes that all floating-point operations are defined and then converts a floating-point result to an integer index. If values contains `NaN`, the result of the division is still `NaN`, and the cast to int32 would result in a crash. This only occurs on the CPU implementation.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `tf.histogram_fixed_width` function did not handle NaN values correctly.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing input validation for NaN values."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A crash (segmentation fault).",
    "Attack vectors": "By providing a `values` array containing NaN elements to `tf.histogram_fixed_width`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to supply input to the `tf.histogram_fixed_width` function.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present in the CPU implementation. The fix was to add a check for NaN values and return an error if found, preventing the crash."
