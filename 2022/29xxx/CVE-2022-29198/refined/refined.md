Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-29198:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability arises from a missing input validation in the `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorToCSRSparseMatrix` operation. Specifically, the code does not validate if the `dense_shape` input is a vector (rank 1) and if `indices` is a matrix (rank 2) as required for sparse tensors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper checks on the rank of the `dense_shape` and `indices` tensors. The code assumes these tensors have specific ranks but doesn't enforce this assumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a `dense_shape` tensor that is not a vector or an `indices` tensor that is not a matrix, an attacker can trigger a `CHECK`-failure that causes a crash. This leads to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting malicious input tensors with invalid shapes when calling `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorToCSRSparseMatrix`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to supply input to the `tf.raw_ops.SparseTensorToCSRSparseMatrix` operation. This could be achieved by having control over the input tensors for a model using this operation.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the C++ code for the `SparseTensorToCSRSparseMatrix` operation located in `tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse/sparse_tensor_to_csr_sparse_matrix_op.cc`.
- The relevant code snippet shows the missing validation:
```c++
    const Tensor& indices = ctx->input(0);
    const Tensor& values = ctx->input(1);
    const Tensor& dense_shape = ctx->input(2);
    const int rank = dense_shape.NumElements();
    OP_REQUIRES(ctx, rank == 2 || rank == 3,
                errors::InvalidArgument("SparseTensor must have rank 2 or 3; ",
                                        "but indices has rank: ", rank));
    auto dense_shape_vec = dense_shape.vec<int64_t>();
```
- The code checks if the indices rank is 2 or 3, but it does not check if `dense_shape` is a vector or if `indices` is a matrix.
- The fix includes checks to ensure `dense_shape` is a vector and `indices` is a matrix.
```c++
    OP_REQUIRES(
        ctx, TensorShapeUtils::IsVector(dense_shape.shape()),
        errors::InvalidArgument("dense_shape must be rank 1 but got rank",
                                dense_shape.shape().dims()));
    OP_REQUIRES(ctx, TensorShapeUtils::IsMatrix(indices.shape()),
                  errors::InvalidArgument("indices must be rank 2 but got rank",
                                          indices.shape().dims()));
```

**Patches:**

- The vulnerability was patched in TensorFlow versions 2.6.4, 2.7.2, 2.8.1 and 2.9.0.
- The fix is implemented in commit `ea50a40e84f6bff15a0912728e35b657548cef11`.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Neophytos Christou from Secure Systems Lab at Brown University.
