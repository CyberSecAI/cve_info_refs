Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29236:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from an improper access control issue in BigBlueButton's whiteboard annotation feature. Specifically, the server-side permission check for drawing on the whiteboard using the pencil tool was being bypassed due to a previously introduced grace period. This allowed users to draw on the whiteboard even if they lacked the necessary permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue was the lack of proper enforcement of access control policies for whiteboard annotations.
- **Grace Period Bypass:** A grace period mechanism, intended for legitimate use cases, was exploited to circumvent permission checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Whiteboard Access: Attackers (meeting participants) could draw on the whiteboard without having the necessary permissions, potentially disrupting the meeting or causing unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is through the network, where the attacker must be a participant in a BigBlueButton meeting.
- **Application Logic:** The vulnerability exists in the server-side logic that manages permissions for whiteboard annotations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Meeting Participant:** The attacker must be a participant in a BigBlueButton meeting to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in BigBlueButton versions 2.3.18 and 2.4-rc-6.
- The fix involved correcting the permission check logic on the server to ensure that the grace period doesn't bypass the intended permission enforcement.
- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by researchers from Paderborn University.
- This is considered a low severity issue.
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in pull requests #13803 and #14265.
- The issue is also referenced in the release notes for versions 2.4-rc-6 and 2.3.18
