Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The identified vulnerabilities are due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Enterprise-Survey-Software 2022" application. Specifically, the application appears to be vulnerable to both reflected and stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The provided information directly gives the vulnerable URL parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects the provided input within the URL parameter 'test' without proper sanitization.
*   **Stored XSS:** The application stores the malicious input provided in the 'test' parameter which then executes when a user visits the page where the stored data is used.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser, this could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Stealing sensitive user information, including cookies.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking on it.
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker could inject the XSS payload through a vulnerable input field which then executes when another user views the stored content. The provided content implies a method involving the 'signup' page but does not provide details on how this form or field might be exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL or identify a way to inject the malicious payload into a stored data field. For reflected XSS, no prior authentication is needed. For stored XSS, the attacker needs to access an input field or form that allows them to inject their payload into the application database.
*   No privileged access to the server is needed. The attack happens on the client side (user's browser).

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided content includes a demo link to surveysparrow.com, however, the vulnerability is associated with an "Enterprise-Survey-Software 2022" application. This implies a separate application was developed that used surveysparrow as a proof of concept. 
* The content provides specific examples of XSS payloads, including the `confirm?.(document.cookie)` payload, which serves to demonstrate the ability to execute JavaScript, which then has the potential to exfiltrate user cookies to an external server controlled by the attacker.
