#### USR IOT 4G LTE Industrial Cellular VPN Router 1.0.36 Remote Root Backdoor

Title: USR IOT 4G LTE Industrial Cellular VPN Router 1.0.36 Remote Root Backdoor

Advisory ID: [ZSL-2022-5705](ZSL-2022-5705.php)

Type: Local/Remote

Impact: Exposure of Sensitive Information, Security Bypass, System Access, DoS

Risk: (5/5)

Release Date: 20.04.2022
##### Summary

USR-G806 is a industrial 4G wireless LTE router which provides
a solution for users to connect own device to 4G network via WiFi interface
or Ethernet interface. USR-G806 adopts high performance embedded CPU which
can support 580MHz working frequency and can be widely used in Smart Grid,
Smart Home, public bus and Vending machine for data transmission at high
speed. USR-G806 supports various functions such as APN card, VPN, WIFIDOG,
flow control and has many advantages including high reliability, simple
operation, reasonable price. USR-G806 supports WAN interface, LAN interface,
WLAN interface, 4G interface. USR-G806 provides various networking mode
to help user establish own network.
##### Description

The USR IOT industrial router is vulnerable to hard-coded credentials
within its Linux distribution image. These sets of credentials are never
exposed to the end-user and cannot be changed through any normal operation
of the device. The 'usr' account with password 'www.usr.cn' has the highest
privileges on the device. The password is also the default WLAN password.
