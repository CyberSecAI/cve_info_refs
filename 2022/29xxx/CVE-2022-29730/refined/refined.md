Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of hardcoded credentials within the Linux distribution image of the USR IOT industrial routers. Specifically, a 'usr' account with the password 'www.usr.cn' is present and cannot be changed through normal device operation. This account has the highest privileges on the system. Additionally, the same password is also the default WLAN password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Hardcoded credentials: The primary vulnerability is the inclusion of a hardcoded username and password ('usr'/'www.usr.cn') in the device's firmware.
- Inability to change credentials: The provided credentials cannot be changed by the end-user through normal device operation.
- Default WLAN password: The same password used for the root account is also the default password for the device's WLAN interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full system access: Successful exploitation provides the attacker with root-level privileges on the affected device.
- Exposure of sensitive information: An attacker with root access can potentially access any data stored on the router.
- Security bypass: The vulnerability allows bypassing the normal authentication mechanisms of the device.
- Denial of Service: An attacker may be able to cause a denial of service
- Further attacks: With root access, attackers can potentially use the compromised device to attack other systems

**Attack vectors:**
- Local network: An attacker on the same local network as the device can attempt to log in using the hardcoded credentials.
- Remote access: Remote exploitation is possible if the device's management interface is exposed to the internet, potentially via the device's default WLAN.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device either on the local network or remotely if the device is exposed.
- Knowledge of hardcoded credentials: The attacker must be aware of the hardcoded username and password ('usr'/'www.usr.cn').

**Additional details:**
- Affected versions: The vulnerability affects multiple device models, including USR-G800V2, USR-G806, USR-G807, USR-G808 (version 1.0.36) and USR-LG220-L (version 1.2.7)
- The vulnerable devices run on GNU/Linux 3.10.14 (mips), OpenWrt/Linaro GCC 4.8-2014.04, Ralink SoC MT7628 PCIe RC mode, BusyBox v1.22.1, uhttpd and Lua.
- A proof of concept exploit is available at [usriot\_root.py](../../codes/usriot_root.txt).
