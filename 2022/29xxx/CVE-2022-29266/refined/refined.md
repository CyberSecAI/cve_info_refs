{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The error logic in the lua-resty-jwt dependency library allows sending an RS256 token to an endpoint expecting an HS256 token. This causes the original secret value to be included in the error response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure through an Error Message",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain the secret configured in the jwt-auth plugin by sending a malformed JWT. This could lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "Sending an incorrect JSON Web Token (specifically an RS256 token to an endpoint configured for HS256) to a route protected by the jwt-auth plugin.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an Apache APISIX server with the vulnerable jwt-auth plugin. No prior authentication or specific user privileges are mentioned as required."
