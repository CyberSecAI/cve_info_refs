Hey there!

I belong to an open source security research community, and a member ([@salmonx](https://github.com/salmonx)) has found an issue, but doesn’t know the best way to disclose it.

If not a hassle, might you kindly add a `SECURITY.md` file with an email, or another contact method? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) this best practice to ensure security issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would serve as a simple instruction for security researchers in the future.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you!
