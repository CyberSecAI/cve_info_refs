The provided content is related to CVE-2022-29045.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `promoted builds` plugin does not escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized parameter names and descriptions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious scripts that execute when a user views the page displaying the vulnerable parameters. This could lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the parameter is displayed on a page, such as the "Build With Parameters" or "Parameters" pages, provided by Jenkins (core) and when those pages are not hardened against XSS exploitation.
- An attacker needs Item/Configure permissions to create a malicious parameter within the Jenkins configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Item/Configure permissions in Jenkins to create/modify jobs with malicious parameter names/descriptions.
- The user must also view the page where the malicious parameters are displayed.
