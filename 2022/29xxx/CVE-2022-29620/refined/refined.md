- **Root cause of vulnerability:** FileZilla Client stores user credentials (username and password) in memory in cleartext format during FTP/SFTP authentication processes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory (CWE-316).
  - Lack of encryption or protection for credentials in memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Compromise of user credentials, leading to potential unauthorized access to remote FTP/SFTP servers.
  - Attackers can gain access to sensitive data on remote servers if they can steal the credentials.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Attacker needs to compromise the victim device to dump the memory of the FileZilla Client process.
  - Memory can be dumped using tools like the Windows Sysinternals procdump.
  - Strings within the memory dump are then extracted to find the cleartext credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - Ability to execute code on the victim's machine (e.g., via a BAT file).
  - Ability to dump memory of the running FileZilla Client process.
  - Ability to transfer the memory dump file from the victim's device to the attacker's system.
