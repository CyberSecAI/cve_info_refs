Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29036:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Credentials Plugin, in versions 1111.v35a_307992395 and earlier, does not properly escape the name and description of the parameter types it provides. This lack of escaping allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected via parameter names or descriptions, which are then stored by the plugin. When these are displayed in the UI, the scripts execute within the user's browser context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view the affected pages. This could lead to a range of malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Sensitive data theft.
    *   Modification of displayed content
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Parameter Names/Descriptions:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the name or description fields of parameter types provided by the Credentials Plugin.
*   **Affected Display Pages:** The injected XSS payload is triggered when users view pages that display these parameter names or descriptions. These pages might include “Build With Parameters” or “Parameters” pages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Item/Configure Permission:** The attacker must have the "Item/Configure" permission within Jenkins to modify job configurations and inject malicious parameter names/descriptions.
*   **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a page where the malicious parameter is displayed.

**Additional Details:**

* The document explicitly mentions that Jenkins core has prevented this type of XSS on "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2, mitigating exploitation in these specific scenarios. However, other pages that might render plugin parameter information could still be vulnerable
* It is part of a group of similar vulnerabilities in other plugins, all stemming from the same root cause of insufficient output sanitization.
* The fixed version of the Credentials Plugin is 1112.vc87b_7a_3597f6, 1087.1089.v2f1b_9a_b_040e4, 1074.1076.v39c30cecb_0e2, and 2.6.1.1 which escape the name and description of the parameter types, thus preventing XSS.
