- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory corruption vulnerability exists in the FTP service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption in the FTP service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to read and write arbitrary files, leading to a full NAS compromise and granting the attacker remote execution capabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is present in the FTP service, and is likely exploitable remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the FTP service, which is likely exposed to the network. Exploitation leads to remote code execution.
