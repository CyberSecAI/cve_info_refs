Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-29519:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information: The Yokogawa STARDOM FCN/FCJ controller transmits sensitive information in cleartext over the network.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The system transmits sensitive data without encryption, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
- Specifically, configuration settings and firmware updates are sent in cleartext.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully intercepts network traffic can read and potentially modify configuration settings.
- An attacker can also potentially update the controller with tampered firmware.
- This can lead to unauthorized changes in device operation or complete takeover of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment.
- The attack complexity is high (AC:H), suggesting that certain conditions or expertise are needed for successful exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device to sniff network traffic.
- No privileges are required to execute this attack, but user interaction is required (UI:R).

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in STARDOM FCN/FCJ versions R1.01 through R4.31.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.8 with the vector string: AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
- Mitigations include using packet filtering on the controller and ensuring network traffic cannot be captured by unauthorized users.
- Yokogawa recommends a strong security program involving patching, anti-virus, network segmentation, hardened networks, and firewalls.
