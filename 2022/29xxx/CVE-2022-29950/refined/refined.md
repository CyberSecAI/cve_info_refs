Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The application (Experian Hunter 1.16) does not properly protect assumed-immutable data such as names and categories of existing Rules and Subrules from modification. The application was designed to only allow modification of descriptions and criteria, but it was not enforcing restrictions on other fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Modification of Assumed-Immutable Data (MAID):** The core vulnerability is the ability to modify data (rule names, subrule names, and subrule categories) that should be considered immutable.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Enforcement:** The application does not properly validate or enforce restrictions on input parameters, allowing modification of fields that should not be editable.
*   **Client-Side Restriction Bypass:** The client-side disabling of the category dropdown is circumvented by modifying the HTML.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Tampering:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to modify the names and categories of rules and subrules.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Tampered data becomes untrustworthy, which may lead to unexpected or incorrect results when data is processed.
*   **Potential for Business Logic Errors:** Manipulated data may impact the application's logic, potentially leading to errors or unintended behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate HTTP request parameters to modify rule and subrule names.
*  **HTML manipulation:** Attackers can use browser's developer tools to modify HTML and bypass restrictions on the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Interception:** Attackers need the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using Burp Suite).
*   **Web Browser Manipulation:** Attackers need to be able to modify HTML elements on the client-side.
*   **Application Access:** Attackers need to have access to the application's interface, specifically the Rules and Subrules pages.
