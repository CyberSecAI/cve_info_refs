- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized user input in the `client_id` parameter of the `/insurance/clientStatus.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive data from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries using the vulnerable parameter. The provided example shows the attacker can determine the length of the database name.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is located in the `/insurance/clientStatus.php` file and is exploited through the `client_id` GET parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and needs to have a valid session cookie or be logged into the system, although the provided examples don't show authentication details for exploitation.
