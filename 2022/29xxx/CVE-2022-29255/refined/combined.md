```
in external call codegen, when `extcodesize` is called on the target
address, the IR for evaluating the target address can be evaluated
twice. this can result in any side effects (embedded in the evaluation
of the target address) being executed twice.

# multiple evaluation of contract address in call

Moderate

[charles-cooper](/charles-cooper)
published
GHSA-4v9q-cgpw-cf38
Jun 6, 2022

## Package

pip

vyper
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<0.3.4

## Patched versions

0.3.4

## Description

### Impact

when a calling an external contract with no return value, the contract address could be evaluated twice. this is usually only an efficiency problem, but if evaluation of the contract address has side effects, it could result in double evaluation of the side effects.

in the following example, `Foo(msg.sender).bar()` is the contract address for the following call (to `.foo()`), and could get evaluated twice

```
interface Foo:
    def foo(): nonpayable
    def bar() -> address: nonpayable

@external
def do_stuff():
    Foo(Foo(msg.sender).bar()).foo()
```
### Patches

[6b4d8ff](https://github.com/vyperlang/vyper/commit/6b4d8ff185de071252feaa1c319712b2d6577f8d)

### Workarounds

assign contract addresses to variables. the above example would change to

```
@external
def do_stuff():
    t: Foo = Foo(msg.sender).bar()
    t.foo()
```
