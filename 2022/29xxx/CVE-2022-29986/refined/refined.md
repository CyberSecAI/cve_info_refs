```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure handling of user input in the `id` parameter within the `delete_facility` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete system compromise. In this example, the attacker is able to extract the database name.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is accessible through an HTTP POST request to the `scbs/classes/Master.php?f=delete_facility` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the application and be able to manipulate the 'id' parameter. No authentication seems required for this specific request."
