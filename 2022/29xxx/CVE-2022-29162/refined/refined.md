  "cve": "CVE-2022-29162",
  "description": "A bug was found in runc where `runc exec --cap` executed processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set.",
  "affected_versions": "< 1.1.2",
  "patched_versions": "1.1.2",
  "root_cause": "The `runc exec --cap` command was incorrectly setting inheritable Linux process capabilities.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "The vulnerability lies in the `runc exec --cap` command not clearing inheritable capabilities, leading to an atypical Linux environment.",
     "Programs with inheritable file capabilities could elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2)."
  ],
  "impact": "A process executed using `runc exec --cap` would inherit unnecessary capabilities. While the inheritable set was bounded by container's permitted capabilities, a process using inheritable file capabilities could elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).",
  "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this by executing a process using `runc exec --cap` with specific inheritable file capabilities.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to execute a process within a container using `runc exec --cap`. They must also have access to programs with inheritable file capabilities."
