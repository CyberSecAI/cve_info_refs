# Smokescreen SSRF via deny list bypass (square brackets)

Moderate

[jjiang-stripe](/jjiang-stripe)
published
GHSA-qwrf-gfpj-qvj6
May 10, 2022

## Package

gomod

smokescreen
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.0.4

## Patched versions

0.0.4

## Description

### Impact

The primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal infrastructure.

Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list feature by surrounding the hostname with square brackets (e.g. `[example.com]`).

### Recommendation

Upgrade Smokescreen to version 0.0.4 or later.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to [Axel Chong](https://github.com/haxatron) for reporting the issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
