- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CSV Injection vulnerability exists in the "Target" page of Acunetix versions before 14. The vulnerability stems from the application not properly sanitizing user-supplied input within the "description" field when exporting target data to a CSV file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or escape special characters (like `=`,`+`,`-`,`@`) in user-supplied descriptions. This allows the attacker to inject formulas that are interpreted by spreadsheet software.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to several impacts:
    - **Hijacking the user's computer:** By injecting malicious formulas, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the user's computer through vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software itself.
    - **Exploiting user trust:** Users may be more inclined to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets downloaded from their own websites, making them susceptible to attack.
    - **Data exfiltration:** Malicious formulas can extract data from the spreadsheet itself or from other open spreadsheets on the user's system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is the "Target" page in Acunetix, specifically the "description" field associated with a target entry.
    - The attacker adds a target with a malicious payload in the description field
    - The attacker then exports the target list to a CSV file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Any user (including non-administrators) of the Acunetix application can inject the payload, but administrative privileges are used for the described exploit.
    - The attacker must be able to access the "Target" page in Acunetix and have the ability to add and export targets.
    - The attacker needs to craft a CSV injection payload which will be executed by victim machine.
