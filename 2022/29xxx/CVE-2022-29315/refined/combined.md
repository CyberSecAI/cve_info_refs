Hi all,

I was using Acunetix version 13.0.201217092 for scanning purposes back in Jan 2021, and I was able to identify CSV Injection vulnerability in the web scanner. Any user who is not the administrator can perform these actions which can lead to admin system compromise. For testing I used the Admin account.

Lets get to the technical details.

**CVE ID Assigned:** CVE-2022-29315

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29315>

<https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-29315>

**Vulnerable Version:** Before version 14

**Fixed Version:** 14 and 14+

**# Software description:**

Acunetix by Invicti Security is an application security testing tool built to help small & mid-size organizations around the world take control of their web security.

**# Technical Details & Impact:**

It was observed that **Target** page is vulnerable to CSV Injection, using CSV injection; Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for three key attacks:

Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524.

Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting the user's tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website.

Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

**# POC**

To start the scan in Acunetix version 13.0.201217092 you have to add the target.

1. Click on "Add Target"
2. Add any target address and in description add CSV Injection Payloads for test I have used **"=10+20+cmd|' /C calc'!A0"**
3.

4. Click on **Save** button
5. The target with malicious payload will be shown in description column.
6. Click on **Export CSV** button
7.

8. CSV will be download and upon opening it will ask for Enable execution
9. Click on enable as the Admin will always trust the downloaded since it downloaded from trusted source, Once enabled it will execute the payload

Dear Reader, I was able to identify stored XSS in multiple web base modules of Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform  Below are its details: # Software description: Ericsson Billing is a convergent billing solution for telecoms that combines an unrivaled combination of out-of-the box features and high configurability. As an evolution of the widely-installed Ericsson BSCS iX, Ericsson Billing provides a low-risk but effective route to capture and secure revenue streams and take advantage of business opportunities from both traditional telecom services as well as digital services, 5G and IoT. # Technical Details & Impact: There are multiple web base modules in BSCS iX e.g. ADMX, MX (monitoring center), CX etc. It was observed that ADMX and MX are vulnerable to stored XSS, In most test cases session hijacking was also possible by utilizing the XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows for full account takeover, or exploiting admin's browsers using beef...
