The provided content is a Dell Security Advisory that includes information about CVE-2022-29084.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Unisphere UI in Dell Unity, Dell UnityVSA, and Dell Unity XT versions before 5.2.0.0.5.173 does not restrict excessive authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of rate limiting on authentication attempts. This can lead to brute-force password attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, unauthenticated attacker can potentially brute-force passwords to gain access to the system. If weak passwords are used, an attacker may achieve account takeover.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access to the Unisphere UI is the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires no prior authentication and needs to access the Unisphere UI remotely.

The content provides more details than the official CVE description by detailing that the lack of restriction on authentication attempts in the Unisphere UI could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to brute-force passwords, leading to potential account takeover if weak passwords are in use.
