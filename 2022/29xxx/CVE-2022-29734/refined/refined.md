Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the 'Name' parameter, before displaying it back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved within the application's database and executed when a user accesses the vulnerable page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML and Script Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the 'Name' field. When another user views the content containing the injected script, the attacker's code executes in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable site. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Credential theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Other malicious activities

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely.
*   **Input Field:** The 'Name' parameter is the specific vulnerable input field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Protege GX/WX system to access and modify the vulnerable 'Name' field.

**Affected Versions:**

*   **GX:** Ver: 2.08.1002 K1B3, Lib: 04.00.217, Int: 2.3.235.J013, OS: 2.0.20
