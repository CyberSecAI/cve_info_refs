Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29046:

**CVE-2022-29046**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Subversion plugin for Jenkins does not escape the name and description of parameter types it provides, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input (parameter names and descriptions) before rendering them in HTML, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Item/Configure permission can inject malicious JavaScript into the parameter names or descriptions. This script would then execute in the browsers of users viewing pages that display these parameters. This could allow the attacker to perform actions such as session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other harmful activities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Jenkins web interface. An attacker needs to be able to configure an item or job, and specifically to be able to add or modify parameters to inject malicious script into the parameter names or descriptions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have "Item/Configure" permission within Jenkins. This means they can create or modify jobs or pipelines.
    *   The attacker must inject the malicious script in the parameter name or description through the Jenkins configuration interface.
    *   The injected payload is stored and triggered when a user views a page displaying the vulnerable parameter, like the "Build with parameters" or "Parameters" pages.

**Additional Notes from the provided documents:**
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of similar XSS issues found in multiple Jenkins plugins that provide additional parameter types.
*   Jenkins core has implemented measures to prevent this type of XSS on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since version 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2.
*   The Subversion Plugin fix requires an update to version 2.15.4.
*   The fix includes proper escaping of parameter names and descriptions to prevent XSS.
