Vulnerability Details:
The output filter mechanism for binary data can be confused by using unknown media-types. Some valid image formats were
not part of our deny-list that handles potentially harmful content. Attackers can generate, upload and share malicious
JS code, disguised as the BMFreehand10 or image/x-freehand image file format. This format is not detected and therefore
no download gets enforced. Some browsers may attempt to render its content "inline".

Root cause of vulnerability:
Insufficient filtering of binary data based on media types allowed for embedding malicious JavaScript code within files.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Inadequate deny-list for potentially harmful content types.
- Failure to enforce download for specific file formats.
- Improper handling of unknown media types

Impact of exploitation:
Malicious script code can be executed within the victim's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface, such as redirects to third-party sites.

Attack vectors:
An attacker generates, uploads, and shares files containing malicious JavaScript code disguised as BMFreehand10 or image/x-freehand files. The victim would then need to follow a hyperlink to trigger the execution of the malicious script.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Access to the same OX App Suite instance as the victim.
- Ability to upload and share specially crafted files.
