- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The device does not handle a specific message correctly in an abnormal scenario, leading to memory not being released.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper message handling leading to a memory leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted message to the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send network messages to the device.
