## Description

![@Unrud](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11810547?v=4&size=48)[Unrud](https://github.com/Unrud)opened [on Apr 21, 2022](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52476#issue-1211653795)
### What version of Go are you using (`go version`)?

```
$ go version
go version go1.18.1 windows/amd64

```
### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?

Yes

### What operating system and processor architecture are you using (`go env`)?

`go env` Output
```
$ go env
set GO111MODULE=
set GOARCH=amd64
set GOBIN=
set GOCACHE=C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\go-build

```
### What did you do?

```
filepath.Clean(`.\c:`)     // `c:`     Input is an invalid path; Output points to drive C
filepath.Clean(`.\c:\foo`) // `c:\foo` Input is an invalid path; Output is an absolute path
filepath.Clean(`.\c:foo`)  // `c:foo`  Input points to ADS `foo` of file `.\c`; Output points to `foo` on drive C
```
### What did you expect to see?

That the paths are equivalent.

### What did you see instead?

They are not equivalent.

### Implications

It can lead to unexpected behavior:

```
package main

import "net/http"

func main() {
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", http.FileServer(http.Dir(".")))
}
```

[http://localhost:8080/c:/Users/](http://localhost:8080/c%3A/Users/) lists the directory content of `C:\Users\`.

# The Go Language Collective is no longer active.

Collectives‚Ñ¢ on Stack Overflow is a new offering in beta release. Currently a Collective requires participation from
a sponsoring organization, so in some cases a Collective may be decommissioned when the sponsorship ends. All questions and
answers that comprised a Collective remain accessible.

# [security] Go 1.18.3 and Go 1.17.11 are released

We have just released Go versions 1.18.3 and 1.17.11, minor point releases.

These minor releases include 4 security fixes following the [security policy](https://go.dev/security):

* crypto/rand: rand.Read hangs with extremely large buffers

  On Windows, rand.Read will hang indefinitely if passed a buffer larger than 1 << 32 - 1 bytes.

  Thanks to Davis Goodin and Quim Muntal, working at Microsoft on the Go toolset, for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-30634 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/52561>.

* crypto/tls: session tickets lack random ticket\_age\_add

  Session tickets generated by crypto/tls did not contain a randomly generated ticket\_age\_add. This allows an attacker that can observe TLS handshakes to correlate successive connections by comparing ticket ages during session resumption.

  Thanks to GitHub user @nervuri for reporting this.

  This is CVE-2022-30629 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/52814>.

* os/exec: empty Cmd.Path can result in running unintended binary on Windows

  If, on Windows, Cmd.Run, cmd.Start, cmd.Output, or cmd.CombinedOutput are executed when Cmd.Path is unset and, in the working directory, there are binaries named either "..com" or "..exe", they will be executed.

  Thanks to Chris Darroch (chris...@github.com), brian m. carlson (bk2...@github.com), and Mikhail Shcherbakov (<https://twitter.com/yu5k3>) for reporting this.

  This is CVE-2022-30580 and¬†Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/52574>.

* path/filepath: Clean(`.\c:`) returns `c:` on Windows

  On Windows, the filepath.Clean function could convert an invalid path to a valid, absolute path. For example, Clean(`.\c:`) returned `c:`.

  Thanks to Unrud for reporting this issue.

  This is CVE-2022-29804 and Go issue <https://go.dev/issue/52476>.

View the release notes for more information:
<https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:
<https://go.dev/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with
"git checkout go1.18.3" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,
Dmitri and Alex for the Go team
