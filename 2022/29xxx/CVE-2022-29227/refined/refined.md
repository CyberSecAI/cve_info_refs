Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-29227.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A lifetime bug exists in Envoy's internal redirect logic when handling requests with bodies or trailers. Specifically, when a redirect leads to an Envoy-generated local reply, the downstream stream might be incorrectly marked as incomplete even when it's already completed and deleted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability due to incorrect handling of the downstream stream state during internal redirects and local replies.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash when the completed downstream stream is accessed after it has been deleted.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote attack via HTTP requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a non-headers-only request that triggers an internal redirect to a route that is configured to generate a local reply. No specific privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability occurs during the `recreateStream` operation within the HTTP connection manager.
- The vulnerability is triggered if the request being redirected has a body or trailers, and the redirect target causes a local reply (e.g., due to a misconfiguration or specific route).
-  The fix involves ensuring the downstream stream state is handled correctly when internal redirects lead to local replies, preventing use-after-free scenarios.
- The commit identified (`fe7c69c248f4fe5a9080c7ccb35275b5218bb5ab`) modifies several files including `conn_manager_impl.cc`, `filter_manager.cc`, `filter_manager.h`, `codec_impl.cc`, `stream_info_impl.h`, and related test files to address this vulnerability.
