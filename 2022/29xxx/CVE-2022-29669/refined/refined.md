**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the `news_Lists.php_zhuan` file, allowing for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerability is present in the `news_Lists.php_zhuan` file due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the `id[]` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. The attacker can also use this vulnerability to enumerate the database structure or execute server-side commands. The provided examples show that an attacker can determine the database name.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the `admin.php/news/admin/lists/zhuan` endpoint with a specially crafted `id[]` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. They likely need to have some level of access to the administrative interface since the request is sent to `admin.php`. They need knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and its parameters.
