Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29226:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Envoy OAuth2 filter implementation incorrectly assumes that access tokens are always validated by an external service. It does not include a mechanism for validating access tokens itself. As a result, the filter allows access to protected endpoints if any access token is present in the request (either in the Authorization header or as a query parameter), even if the HMAC signed cookie is missing which should trigger the full authentication flow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of access token validation within the OAuth2 filter.
- Improper handling of access tokens by trusting any provided token without verification
- The filter skips the full authentication flow when an arbitrary access token is provided.
- The filter does not enforce that only the HMAC signed cookie should be used for authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to endpoints that are supposed to be protected by the OAuth2 filter.
- Bypassing of the intended authentication mechanism.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a request to an endpoint protected by the OAuth2 filter.
- Including an arbitrary access token in the `Authorization` header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer asdfasdfasdfasd`).
- Including an arbitrary access token in the query parameter (e.g., `?token=xyz-queryparam-token`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected Envoy instance.
- The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or user interaction.
- The attacker does not need to know a valid token, any arbitrary token will allow access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists because the OAuth2 filter's logic was broken and assumed an additional call would be performed to the auth server. This is not the case, according to the filter documentation, a request is only considered subsequently authenticated if there's a valid cookie that was set after the access token was received from the auth server.
- The fix involves removing the logic that blindly accepts access tokens and ensures that the filter relies on the HMAC signed cookie for authentication.
- The provided commit also fixes an issue with calling `continueDecoding()` after `encodeHeaders()`.
