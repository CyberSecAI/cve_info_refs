### @francislavoie **[francislavoie](/francislavoie)** commented [Dec 30, 2021](#issue-1090871486)

This is a followup to [#4407](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/4407), in response to a report on the forums: <https://caddy.community/t/php-fastcgi-phishing-redirection/14542>

Turns out that doing `TrimRight` to remove trailing dots, *before* cleaning the path, will cause double-dots at the end of the path to not be cleaned away as they should. We should instead remove the dots *after* cleaning.

Sorry, something went wrong.
