So many nice things about this plugin but ran into a bug and forced me to find another. The problem occurred when I added the option for the viewer to close it. After I closed it in my testing, I couldn’t get it back to continue testing. That makes sense except that I deactivated it to try and get it to reset and it still wouldn’t. I was left with a blank white stripe where it was supposed to show up in a gold stripe. I even completely deleted the plugin and tried again. All I got was the white stripe and no content.

It works as described but isn’t very pretty. There are some configuration options, but it covers up my site and doesn’t look very good.

Be careful – immediately after activating the plugin, it crashed and gave the following error. My developers are still trying to access the backend through SFTP to gain access. Right now, we cannot even reach the login page, and the entire site is down.
Fatal error: session\_start(): Failed to initialize storage module: user (path: ) in /srv/bindings/d70156b166aa49a0a1e8c75a59bc6b45/code/wp-content/plugins/8-degree-notification-bar/8degree-notification.php on line 207

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
