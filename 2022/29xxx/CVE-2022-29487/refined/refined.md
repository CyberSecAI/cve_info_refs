Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-29487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cybozu Office due to insufficient sanitization of specific parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting):** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input within specific parameters before rendering it in a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of a logged-in user's web browser. This can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Stealing of sensitive information (cookies, user data)
  - Defacement of the web page
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a user interaction (UI:R), and affecting the context of the user (S:C). 
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL or payload containing the XSS code and trick a logged-in user into accessing it. This could be via a phishing email, malicious link on a website or some other form of social engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N).
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a victim to click the malicious crafted link.
