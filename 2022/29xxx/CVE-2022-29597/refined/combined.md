# CVE-2022-29597: Local File Inclusion in RSS v500

The [RRS](https://solutions-atlantic.com/regulatory-reporting-system/) v500 application by Solutions Atlantic is vulnerable to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability. Any authenticated user has the ability to reference internal system files within requests made to the `/RRSWeb/maint/ShowDocument/ShowDocument.aspx` page. The server will successfully respond with the file contents of the internal system file requested. This ability could allow for adversaries to extract sensitive data and/or files from the underlying file system, gain knowledge about the internal workings of the system, or access source code of the application.

Mitre URL: <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-29597>

NIST URL: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29597>

## Proof of Concept (POC):

### Show Document Functionality:

**Affected URL:**

* `/RRSWeb/maint/ShowDocument/ShowDocument.aspx`

While opening or downloading a PDF from the RRS site, a request is made to the affected URL that includes a `fileName` parameter. This parameter could be modified to include an internal system path, such as `web.config`. The server will then serve the file requested.

**GET request with internal path to web.config:**

```
GET /RRSWeb/maint/ShowDocument/ShowDocument.aspx?fileName=C:\\Program%20Files\\Solutions%20Atlantic\\RRS\\RRSWeb\\web.config HTTP/1.1
Host: <REDACTED>
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
