### **[dvdr00t](/dvdr00t)** commented [Mar 7, 2023](#issuecomment-1458518815)

| Hello [@yazi7](https://github.com/yazi7), I was reviewing your issue and the related [CVE-2022-29001](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-29001). It appears to me that, while uploading a `.php` file works fine (as the CVE is indeed an arbitrary file upload vulnerability), the file cannot be executed by the Apache Tomcat/9.0.16 Web Engine, which does not natively support PHP execution (as it requires a third-party plugin or a bridge like Apache Tomcat Connectors).  Can you please provides more insights on the file uploading vulnerability you found?  Thanks in advance. |
