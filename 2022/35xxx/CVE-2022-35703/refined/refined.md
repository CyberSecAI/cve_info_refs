**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to read data from a memory location that is outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   The attack requires user interaction (UI:R), implying that a user would need to perform an action, such as opening a malicious file, to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attack does not require any privileges (PR:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs local access to the system, but does not need any special privileges on the target system. They would also need to get the user to perform an action like opening a malicious file to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8, with the CVSS vector being `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
* The vulnerability is categorized as "critical".
* The affected products are Adobe Bridge versions 12.0.2 and earlier, and 11.1.3 and earlier, for both Windows and macOS.
