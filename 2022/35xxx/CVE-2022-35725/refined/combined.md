  Installation:

1. Install via the WordPress plugin admin dialog (search for wp-forecast) or
2. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`, keeping

   the directory structure intact (i.e. wp-forecast.php should end up

   in `wp-content/plugins/wp-forecast/`).
3. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen.
4. Visit the configuration page (`Options -> WP-forecast`) to pick the

   number of widgets, data to display and to change any other option.
5. Visit the Themes/Widgets page to place your wp-forecast widget within

   your themes sidebars or insert it manually and edit your template

   file and put the wp-forecast function where you want your weather

   data to show up.

   Example: `<ul><li>

   <?php if(function_exists(wp_forecast)) {

   wp_forecast( <widget_id> );

   } ?>

   </li></ul>`

   You have to replace <widget\_id> with the choosen widget id.

   For the first widget use wp\_forecast(“A”), for the second

   wp\_forecast(“B”) and so on.

   In most cases it is advisable to put the call into a div environment.
6. Optional

   If you would like to have another set of icons download it

   from <http://accunet.accuweather.com/wx/accunet/graphics_icons.htm>

   and put it into the wp-content/plugins/wp-forecast/icons folder
7. Optional

   If you would like to change the style, just edit wp-forecast.css

   there are three classes div.wp-forecast for outer formatting,

   table.wp-forecast for the middle part or iconpart and

   wp-forecast-details for everything below the icon

### Translations

wp-forecast comes with various translations, located in the directory `lang`.

if you would like to add a new translation, just take the file

wp-forecast.pot (in the wp-forecast main directory) copy it to

wp-forecast\_-.po and edit it to add your translations

(e.g. with poedit).

Please be aware that the number codes stand for the weather-situations.

you can see the mapping in wp-forecast-en\_US-en\_US.po. there are also

the letters N, S, W, E they stand for the winddirections and can be

translates either.

To use your own translation, a different one as the default just rename the

appropriate file wp-forecast\_-.po and

wp-forecast\_-.mo

To add your translations online at the Translate WordPress project please visit

https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-forecast. This should be the prefered

way from now on.

## FAQ

### Where can I get further information about the plugin?

There are severeal ressources to visit:

* [The german wp-forecast page](https://www.tuxlog.de/wp-forecast/ "German wp-forecast-page")
* [The german reference](https://www.tuxlog.de/wp-forecast-handbuch/ "German wp-forecast-manual")
* [A short FAQ list in german](https://www.tuxlog.de/wordpress/2007/wp-forecast-wie-geht-das/ "wp-forecast FAQ - Wie geht das?")
* [A checklist in case of problems (german and english)](https://www.tuxlog.de/uncategorized/2009/checkliste-fur-wp-forecast-checklist-for-wp-worecast/ "wp-forecast checklist for connection problems")
* [The english readme.txt](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-forecast/ "you are actually reading this one")
* [The english reference (a bit out of date but still useful)](https://www.tuxlog.de/wordpress/2008/wp-forecast-reference-v17-english/ "english reference for wp-forecast")

### After upgrading the plugin my widgets are gone. Any Ideas?

Probably you used the automatic upgrade which disables the widget during update and sometimes removes the configured widgets. Just add the widgets again.

### After upgrading my settings are gone. How can this be?

Probably you have enabled “Delete options during plugin deactivation?” and used automatically update or disabled the plugin during update. When this option is marked everey database entries inserted by wp-forecast are removed from the database.

The plugin doesn’t work for me and I posted in the support forum a few days ago and looking through the unsanswered posts there, suggests there is no support for plugin so lowest rating sadly.

The plugin offers many and simple configuration options and does everything you need for the current weather and a forecast over several days – and all without high monthly or annual costs. Simply great.

Very nice and useful Plugin. Easy to customize and works well with openweathermap API Key. The use of expensive ipstack API for Geolocation is not necessary. Customizing CSS in Child Themes CSS works also well. But one thing to mention, when you’re using PHP 8.0 or grater, the API with openweather did not deliver data.

I’m struggling to change some CSS rules.
In wp-content/plugins/wp-forecast/wp-forecast-default.css I make the headers larger and the space between the day blocks larger, it works when I change it live on the browser but it doesn’t when the page is loading again, still works with the old values.
I’m using WPRocket, so I cleared countless times the cache, cleared every possible cache on browsers, deactivated and activated the plugin, erased the plugin, and installed it again….still has the same fucking old values!
The page source code shows that the domain.com/el/wp-content/plugins/wp-forecast/wp-forecast-default.css?ver=9999 is loading, and the file has good large values, but every browser insists to show the old ones.
I spent 4 hours of my precious time without any results. It’s the first time after months that I feel exasperated!
I give it 1 star because there isn’t any lower.

Even though I have Use visitors location checked, it still defaults to Frankfurt. Now it stopped working completely. Useless.

Great support by mail and good updates!
AccuWeather stopped sending new data and quickly after, OpenWeathermap was added.
So using my OpenWeathermap API it works perfectly again.
