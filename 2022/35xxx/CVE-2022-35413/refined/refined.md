Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35413:

**Summary:**

CVE-2022-35413 relates to hardcoded credentials for a system account used in the Web API of Penta Security's WAPPLES Web Application Firewall (WAF). This account is not documented or modifiable through standard means. Attackers can exploit these credentials to gain unauthorized access to the WAPPLES Web API, potentially leading to various malicious activities.

**Details:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from the presence of a predefined system account ("systemi") with hardcoded credentials within the WAPPLES software. These credentials are used in system scripts for internal API access.
    *   The account and its credentials are not disclosed in user manuals or accessible through the standard WAPPLES interface.
*  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The core weakness is the use of hardcoded credentials that are the same across installations, making exploitation easy if discovered.
    *   **Lack of Documentation:** The existence of the "systemi" account and its credentials are not documented, meaning administrators are unaware of this potential risk.
    *   **API Access:** The credentials provide access to the Web API, allowing manipulation of sensitive settings.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can use the hardcoded credentials to bypass authentication to the Web API.
    *   **Data Exposure:** With access to the API, the attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information, such as SMTP passwords.
     *   **System Modification:** The API likely allows for modification of system settings, such as user management, backup configurations, and SSL certificates, leading to further exploitation or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the WAPPLES management interface to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   **API Requests:** The attacker uses the "systemi" credentials in API requests to the WAPPLES management interface on port 5001.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the WAPPLES device's management interface (port 5001).
    *   **Knowledge of Credentials:** The attacker needs the specific username and password of the "systemi" account (which is hardcoded and thus the same on all vulnerable instances).

**Additional Information:**

*   The provided Medium article indicates that this vulnerability affects WAPPLES versions 4.0 (>=4.0.54.1), 5.0, and 6.0.
*   The article also mentions that versions 4 and 5 are no longer supported, highlighting the importance of upgrading.
*   The article outlines that the vulnerability can be exploited to download arbitrary files, obtain SMTP passwords, and manage users, among other things.
*   The account can be viewed in the CouchDB database by connecting to it directly.

**Summary of Findings:**

The vulnerability lies in the presence of hardcoded API credentials that are not documented.  An attacker can leverage these to gain unauthorized access to API endpoints and potentially perform a variety of malicious activities, including data exfiltration, system modifications, and lateral movement if combined with other vulnerabilities.
