The provided content details a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Clinic's Patient Management System v1.0" by oretnom23.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the `update_medicine_details.php` file. The `packing` parameter is vulnerable as it allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability in the `packing` parameter within `update_medicine_details.php`.
- Lack of input sanitization when updating medicine details.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages.
- The injected script could be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious script via the `packing` parameter in the `update_medicine_details.php` page.
- The injected script is stored in the database.
- When a user accesses the medicine details page (or the edit page again) the stored script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid admin credentials to log in to the backend system.
- The attacker must be able to access the medicine details editing page.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `packing` parameter within the update functionality to inject the malicious script.
