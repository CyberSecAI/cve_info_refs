- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities in the parsing of JP2 files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly validate the data within the JP2 file, allowing a crafted file to force an out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure by allowing an attacker to read memory contents within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to create a specially crafted JP2 file. This file would then need to be opened by a vulnerable version of MicroStation or a MicroStation-based application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to deliver the crafted JP2 file to a user of a vulnerable application. The user would then need to open the file to trigger the vulnerability. This is typically a local attack vector, requiring user interaction.
