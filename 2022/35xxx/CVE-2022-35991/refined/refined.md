Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35991:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `TensorListScatter` and `TensorListScatterV2` operations in TensorFlow not properly validating the rank of the `element_shape` input. Specifically, the code allowed an `element_shape` with a rank greater than 1 which was not intended.

**Weaknesses:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation for the `element_shape` input, specifically its rank, in the `TensorListScatter` and `TensorListScatterV2` operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** When an `element_shape` with rank greater than 1 is provided to either `TensorListScatter` or `TensorListScatterV2`, it leads to a `CHECK` failure. This failure causes the TensorFlow process to terminate, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker providing a specially crafted input to `TensorListScatter` or `TensorListScatterV2` where the `element_shape` has a rank greater than 1. This input could be supplied through user-controlled data that flows into a TensorFlow model.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the inputs of a TensorFlow model that uses the vulnerable `TensorListScatter` or `TensorListScatterV2` operations. This means that the attacker would have some control over the data being fed into the TensorFlow graph.
- The attacker doesn't need to be local, as the malicious input can come from any source, such as network requests, files or other means.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check that verifies the rank of `element_shape` is at most 1.
- The patch was included in TensorFlow versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0
- The provided code examples show how to trigger the vulnerability and how the fix was implemented.
