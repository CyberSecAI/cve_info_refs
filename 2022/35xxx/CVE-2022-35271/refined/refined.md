- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `hashFirst` function in the GoAhead web server library does not properly validate the `WebsHash` identifier, which is used as an index to access an array. If this identifier is out of the valid range (e.g. -1), it leads to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read, lack of proper input validation. The `assert` function does not halt execution but proceeds to access an array using an invalid index.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS). The out-of-bounds read can cause a segmentation fault, leading to the termination of the web server process.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/action/import_cert_file/` API without including any files will cause the `webs->files` value to be -1, which will then be passed as an argument to the `hashFirst` function, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. The attacker does not require prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.
