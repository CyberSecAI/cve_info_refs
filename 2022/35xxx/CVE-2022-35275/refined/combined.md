[Please, visit the link and follow the instructions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)

## FAQ

Please, review [user guide](https://docs.algolplus.com/order-export-docs/) at first.

Check [some snippets](https://algolplus.com/plugins/snippets-plugins/) for popular plugins or review [this page](https://algolplus.com/plugins/code-samples/) to study how to extend the plugin.

Still need help? Create ticket in [helpdesk system](https://algolplus.freshdesk.com). Don’t forget to attach your settings or some screenshots. It will significantly reduce reply time 🙂

### I want to add a product attribute to the export

Check screenshot #5! You should open section “Set up fields”, open section “Product order items”(right column), click button “Add field”, select field in 1st dropdown, type column title and press button “Confirm”.

### Same order was exported many times

You should open section “Set up fields to export” and set “Fill order columns for” to “1st row only”. The plugin repeats common information for each order item (by default).

### I see only GREEN fields in section “Set up fields”

Please, unmark checkbox “Summary Report By Products” (it’s below date range)

### Red text flashes at bottom during page loading

It’s a normal situation. The plugin hides this warning on successful load.

### I can’t filter/export custom attribute for Simple Product

I’m sorry, but it’s impossible. You should add this attribute to Products>Attributes at first and use “Filter by Product Taxonomies”.

### How can I add a Gravity Forms field to export?

Open order, look at items and remember meta name.

Visit WooCommerce>Export Orders,

open section “Set up fields”, open section “Product order items”(at right), click button “Add field”,

select SAME name in second dropdown (screenshot #5)

### Plugin produces unreadable XLS file

The theme or another plugin outputs some lines. Usually, there are extra empty lines at the end of functions.php(in active theme).

### I can’t export Excel file (blank message or error 500)

Please, increase “memory\_limit” upto 256M or ask hosting support to do it.

### When exporting .csv containing european special characters , I want to open this csv in Excel without extra actions

You should open tab “CSV” and set up ISO-8859-1 as codepage.

### Preview shows wrong values, I use Summary mode

This button processes only first 5 orders by default, so you should run the export to see correct values.

### Is it compatible with “WooCommerce Custom Orders Table” plugin (by Liquid Web) ?

No, as we provide a lot of filters which can not be implemented using WooCommerce classes. So we use direct access to database/tables.

### Where does free version save files?

Free version doesn’t save generated file on your webserver, you can only download it using browser.

### Can I request any new feature ?

Yes, you can email a request to aprokaev@gmail.com. We intensively develop this plugin.

PayPal Fee column is empty when exporting, making the plugin useless for accounting

The best Woocommerce export plugin! I’ve been using the free version to run all sorts of order reports. I am now going to upgrade to the Pro version to save profiles and run scheduled jobs. Thank you for a great plugin!

After messing around for years with paid extensions to export order data that took forever and regularly timed out I was amazed to find that this FREE extension handled what I needed and more!Exports are easily filtered using pretty much any meta you could think of and quickly exported. Exports of hundreds of orders take seconds. Love it. Great work.

Second only to WooCommerce itself, this plugin is brilliant and does so much for our website. Although it is advertised and sold as an order export plugin, we use it for a myriad of reports as well as controlling our order flow. We wouldn’t be without it and cannot praise it highly enough. If that wasn’t enough, the tremendous support we receive from its author (in the form of coding tips) has allowed us to add extra facilities to our site and improve our admin process tremendously. Thanks AlgolPlus for your continued updates and assistance.

When I export, when it reaches 97%, WordPress gives an unexpected error. Can anyone guide me?
