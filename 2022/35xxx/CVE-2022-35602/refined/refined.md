The provided content relates to CVE-2022-35602.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in several Java files of the `InventoryManagementSystem`, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple files:
  - `UserDAO.java` (parameters: user, pass, etc.)
  - `Stocks.java` (parameter: productcode)
  - `SupplierDAO.java` (parameter: searchTxt)
  - `ProductDAO.java` (parameter: searchTxt)
  - `CustomerDAO.java` (parameters: searchTxt, customercode, etc.)
  - `ConnectionFactory.java` (parameters: username, password, user, etc.)
The vulnerability is due to direct inclusion of user-provided input in SQL queries without proper escaping or use of parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, leading to potential data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user input parameters in the listed Java files that are incorporated into SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input to the affected parameters. This could be through the application's user interface or other means of input to the application.
