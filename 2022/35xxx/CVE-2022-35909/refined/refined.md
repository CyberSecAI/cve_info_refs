Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-35909:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   Incorrect access control in the `/users` endpoint, allowing an unprivileged user to list all users and identify administrators.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The application uses predictable user IDs, which could be discovered by an attacker.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** Unprivileged users can access information they should not have access to (e.g., listing all users and their roles). This bypasses intended authorization checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An unprivileged user can identify administrator users. This is the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-35909.
*   Further exploitation (covered by CVE-2022-35910, but part of the described attack chain) allowed for privilege escalation to administrator, leading to full control over the Jellyfin server including creating new users, deleting users, and accessing restricted media.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network-based attack.
*   The attacker intercepts requests through a proxy (Burp Suite) to observe and manipulate API calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a valid account on the Jellyfin server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g. by using Burp Suite).
*   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the `/users` endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was present in Jellyfin version 10.7.7 and was fixed in version 10.8.0.
*   The provided text also describes CVE-2022-35910 and how it's related to CVE-2022-35909 in an attack chain.
