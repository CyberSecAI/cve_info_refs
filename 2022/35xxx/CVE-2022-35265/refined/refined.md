- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `hashFirst` function in the GoAhead web server library does not properly validate the `WebsHash` argument, which is used as an index into an array. When a POST request does not include files, the `webs->files` value becomes -1. This invalid value is then used to access the array, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `hashFirst` function due to lack of proper bounds checking. The `assert` function used in the code does not halt execution when the condition is false.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. An attacker can crash the web server, rendering the device unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/action/import_nodejs_app/` endpoint without including any files will trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server.
