{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `DenseBincount` operation in TensorFlow does not properly validate the shape of the `weights` tensor against the `input` tensor.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted `weights` tensor with an incompatible shape can trigger a `CHECK` fail, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a `weights` tensor with a shape different from the `input` tensor, while also not being a length-0 tensor, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the input parameters to the `DenseBincount` operation, specifically the `weights` tensor."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "patches": "The vulnerability was patched by adding checks to ensure the `weights` tensor either has the same shape as the `input` tensor or is a length-0 tensor.",
    "affected_versions": "TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 are affected. Specifically, versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x and 2.9.x are vulnerable.",
    "patched_versions": "The issue is fixed in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0."
