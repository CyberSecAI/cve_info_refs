Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35971:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing input validation checks within the `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the code did not verify that the `min` and `max` tensors, which define the quantization range, were scalar values (rank 0 tensors).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation for the rank of the `min` and `max` tensors in the `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars` operation.
- **CHECK Fail:** Passing non-scalar tensors as `min` or `max` leads to a `CHECK` fail. This is a type of assertion failure that terminates the TensorFlow process, which is not safe to expose to untrusted user inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger the `CHECK` fail by providing incorrectly shaped `min` or `max` tensors. This causes the TensorFlow process to terminate, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Call:** An attacker can directly call the `tf.raw_ops.FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars` operation with crafted inputs.
- **Model manipulation:** Models containing this op with malicious min/max values can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code, either by directly using the API or through a malicious model or input data that is processed by TensorFlow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that `min` and `max` tensors are indeed scalar values. This is done by verifying the shape of those tensors.
- The vulnerability is present in multiple quantization ops, not just `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVars` but also in `QuantizedBiasAdd`, `QuantizedInstanceNorm` and `Requantize`.
- The provided GitHub commit includes fixes for the missing checks on min/max for multiple quantization ops.
- The issue is considered a low severity vulnerability.
