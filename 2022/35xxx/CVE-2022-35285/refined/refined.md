Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35285:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw within the query facility of the Audit Events UI in IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when querying the audit events database, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized actions: An attacker can leverage the SQL injection vulnerability to execute unauthorized database queries and potentially modify or exfiltrate data.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The attacker can use CSRF techniques to force a logged-in user to perform unintended actions on the application, exploiting the SQL injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Audit Events UI, where user input is not properly validated before being used in SQL queries.
- Cross-site request forgery is involved to initiate the malicious query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the ISIQ application, likely through a web interface.
- The attacker would likely need knowledge of the application's structure to craft a suitable SQL injection payload and execute a cross-site request forgery.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects IBM Security Verify Information Queue version 10.0.2
- The vulnerability is resolved in version 10.0.3
- There are no workarounds or mitigations available except for updating the product to the latest version
