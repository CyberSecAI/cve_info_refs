The provided content relates to CVE-2022-35269.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `hashFirst` function of the GoAhead web server library used by the Robustel R1510 router. The `hashFirst` function uses an identifier for a specific hash table (`WebsHash`) as an index into an array. When a POST request with no files is made to vulnerable API endpoints, the `webs->files` value is -1. The `hashFirst` function does not properly validate this value, which leads to an out-of-bounds array access, causing a crash of the web server process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read due to a lack of proper bounds checking on the `WebsHash` value before accessing an array using it as an index.
- The `assert` macro is ineffective in preventing the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) of the web server on the affected Robustel R1510 router. This results in the termination of the web server process, which makes the device's web interface inaccessible.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/action/import_e2c_json_file/` API endpoint without including any files in the request.
- Similar exploitation is possible on other identified API endpoints on the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the web server of the Robustel R1510 router.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable API endpoint (`/action/import_e2c_json_file/` in this case) and the specific request format that triggers the vulnerability.
