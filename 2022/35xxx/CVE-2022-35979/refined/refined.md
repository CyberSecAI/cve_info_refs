  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability occurs because the `QuantizedRelu` and `QuantizedRelu6` operations in TensorFlow do not properly validate the rank of the `min_features` and `max_features` input tensors. These inputs are expected to be scalars (rank 0), but the code doesn't enforce this condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of input validation for the rank of `min_features` and `max_features` tensors in `QuantizedRelu` and `QuantizedRelu6` operations.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A non-scalar input for `min_features` or `max_features` in `QuantizedRelu` or `QuantizedRelu6` can trigger a segmentation fault (segfault), which can be used to cause a denial-of-service (DoS).",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker provides a crafted TensorFlow graph that calls `QuantizedRelu` or `QuantizedRelu6` with non-scalar tensors as inputs for `min_features` or `max_features`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify TensorFlow graphs that can be executed. This typically means being able to control the inputs of a TensorFlow model."
