Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35964:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `BlockLSTMGradV2` implementation in TensorFlow did not properly validate the rank/dimensions of its input tensors (`x`, `cs_prev`, `h_prev`, `w`, `wci`, `wcf`, `wco`, and `b`). Specifically, it was missing checks to ensure that `wci`, `wcf`, `wco`, and `b` are rank 1 tensors, `w`, `cs_prev`, and `h_prev` are rank 2 tensors, and `x` is a rank 3 tensor.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation: The code did not enforce the correct tensor dimensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Providing input tensors with incorrect ranks results in a segmentation fault (segfault), causing the program to crash. This can be exploited to trigger a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input: An attacker can cause the vulnerability by feeding the vulnerable function, `BlockLSTMGradV2`, with input tensors having incorrect shapes, which would trigger the segfault.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `BlockLSTMGradV2` operation within a TensorFlow graph. This means they need control over the input tensors being passed to this function. This could be achieved by:
    - Crafting a specific TensorFlow model that includes the vulnerable operation with malformed inputs.
    - Modifying existing model inputs.
    - Having control over inputs in an environment using the TensorFlow library (e.g., if an application processes user input using TensorFlow models).
