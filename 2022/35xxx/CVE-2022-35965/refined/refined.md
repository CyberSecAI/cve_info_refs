The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35965.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for empty inputs in the `LowerBound` and `UpperBound` operations. When these operations receive an empty `sorted_inputs` tensor, the code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code dereferences a null pointer when `sorted_inputs` is empty. This occurs because no check is performed to see if `sorted_inputs` is empty before proceeding to use it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: The vulnerability can be exploited by providing an empty `sorted_inputs` tensor to the `LowerBound` or `UpperBound` operations. This will result in a segmentation fault, which causes the program to crash, thus leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a crafted input: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing an empty `sorted_inputs` tensor to the `LowerBound` or `UpperBound` operations. This could be done through a machine learning model that uses these operations or through other means by which an attacker could control the inputs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to TensorFlow operations. The attacker doesn't necessarily need direct access to the TensorFlow application. They can trigger this through a crafted machine learning model, or via some other means where they could control input parameters.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions before 2.10.0.
- Patched versions include 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The fix involves adding a check for empty `sorted_inputs` and returning a zero-filled output when it is empty.
- The commit bce3717eaef4f769019fd18e990464ca4a2efeea addresses the vulnerability by adding this check and implementing the fix.
