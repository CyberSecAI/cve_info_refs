The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35261.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `hashFirst` function of the GoAhead web server library, specifically version 4.0.0, used by Robustel R1510 routers. The `hashFirst` function takes a `WebsHash` value as input, which acts as an identifier for a hash table. If this identifier is out of the valid range, it leads to an access of an array with an invalid index in the `sym` array. The assertion check implemented in the code does not prevent the code execution flow from continuing and thus accessing the array with a negative index, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125).
- Usage of a non-standard `assert` macro that doesn't halt execution upon failure.
- Lack of proper input validation for the `WebsHash` value in the `hashFirst` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation leads to a segmentation fault that terminates the web server process, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted network request to the affected API endpoint ( `/action/import_authorized_keys/` ).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to send a POST request to the `/action/import_authorized_keys/` endpoint without including any files, which causes the value of `webs->files` to be -1.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `hashFirst` function when processing requests, if the `webs->files` value is -1 it will cause the `sym` array access to trigger the vulnerability.
- Several API endpoints are vulnerable to this flaw, all using the `hashFirst` function. CVE-2022-35261 specifically affects the `/action/import_authorized_keys/` API.
- The vulnerability is present in Robustel R1510 versions 3.1.16 and 3.3.0.
