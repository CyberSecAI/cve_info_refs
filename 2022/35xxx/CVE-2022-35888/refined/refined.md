- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hertzbleed is a power side-channel attack where the processor's frequency scaling is correlated with the instructions and data being processed. Changes in processor frequency during a victim task can be observed through execution time, allowing inference of power consumption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Power side-channel vulnerability; indirect correlation between processor frequency scaling and executed instructions/data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Potential compromise of confidentiality of data used in a victim task.
- **Attack vectors:** Observing the execution time of a victim task to infer power consumption and correlate it with processor frequency changes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to observe the execution time of the victim task and correlate this with frequency scaling behavior. This does not specify if the attacker needs to be local or remote.
