{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `AvgPoolGrad` implementation does not fully validate the input `orig_input_shape`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation in the `AvgPoolGrad` operation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A `CHECK` failure can be triggered, leading to a denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted, invalid `orig_input_shape` to the `AvgPoolGrad` operation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `orig_input_shape` parameter passed to the `AvgPoolGrad` operation within a TensorFlow environment."
