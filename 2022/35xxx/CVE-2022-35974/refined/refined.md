Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35974:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange` operation in TensorFlow did not properly validate the shape of the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors. It was expecting scalar inputs (rank 0 tensors), but it did not check for this condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The code lacked a check to ensure that the `input_min` and `input_max` tensors were scalars.
- **Segfault:**  When non-scalar tensors were provided as input for  `input_min` and `input_max`, it resulted in a segmentation fault (segfault).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A malicious actor could craft input with non-scalar tensors for  `input_min` and `input_max` that would cause the program to crash via a segfault, resulting in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing crafted input to the `QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange` operation. Specifically by providing non-scalar tensors as inputs for `input_min` and `input_max`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow model that uses the `QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange` operation.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 are affected. Specifically, versions 2.7.x, 2.8.x, and 2.9.x are vulnerable.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is patched in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- **Patch:** The fix involves adding checks to ensure that `input_min` and `input_max` are scalar tensors before they are used by the `QuantizeDownAndShrinkRange` operation. The commit that addresses the vulnerability is [73ad1815ebcfeb7c051f9c2f7ab5024380ca8613](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/73ad1815ebcfeb7c051f9c2f7ab5024380ca8613).
- **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
- **Reporter:** The vulnerability was reported by Neophytos Christou, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.
