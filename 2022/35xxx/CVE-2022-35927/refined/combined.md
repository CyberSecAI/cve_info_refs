### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Jun 4, 2021](#issue-911572229)

By sending a DIO with a too large length in the prefix info option, it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying the prefix in the `set_ip_from_prefix` function. In this PR, we insert a validation check that discards the DIO if this value is too large.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hello [@joakimeriksson](https://github.com/joakimeriksson) and [@nvt](https://github.com/nvt)  Thank you for a critical update and release.  Are these in any way related to the bugs reported by Forescout? <https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/815128>  Were there any CVE's to identify the vulnerabilities so they can be tracked?  Thanks Vijay CERT/CC |

| Yes, some of the fixes in the release do fix some of the reported bugs. We have started to publish some of the CVEs here in our repo also. Take a look at the security section. |

# Unverified DIO prefix info lengths in RPL-Classic

High

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-9rm9-3phh-p4wm
Aug 4, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 4.7

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

In the RPL-Classic routing protocol implementation in the Contiki-NG operating system, an incoming DODAG Information Option (DIO) control message can contain a prefix information option with a length parameter. The value of the length parameter is not validated, however, and it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying the prefix in the set\_ip\_from\_prefix function.

This vulnerability affects anyone running a Contiki-NG version prior to 4.7 that can receive RPL DIO messages from external parties.

### Patches

To obtain a patched version, users should upgrade to Contiki-NG 4.7 or later.

### Workarounds

The problem has been patched in PR [#1589](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1589), which inserts a validation check that discards DIOs with too large length values in the prefix info option.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng>
* Email us at security@contiki-ng.org

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-35927

### Weaknesses

[CWE-120](/advisories?query=cwe%3A120)
