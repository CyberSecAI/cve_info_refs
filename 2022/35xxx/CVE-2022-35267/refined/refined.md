The content is related to CVE-2022-35267.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `hashFirst` function in the GoAhead library used by Robustel R1510 does not properly validate the input `WebsHash` value, leading to an out-of-bounds read when the value is out of range. The `assert` check does not prevent the out-of-bounds access.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to improper input validation. The `assert` function is ineffective in preventing the use of out-of-bounds index.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by sending a crafted request that leads to a segmentation fault in the web server, terminating the process.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a POST request to the `/action/import_https_cert_file/` API without including any files will cause `webs->files` to have a value of -1. This will be passed to `hashFirst`, leading to out-of-bounds read at `sym[sd]`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server on the device, and doesn't need to be authenticated to trigger the vulnerability.
