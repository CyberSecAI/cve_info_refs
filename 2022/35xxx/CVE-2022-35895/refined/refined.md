Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-35895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `FwBlockServiceSmm` driver in InsydeH2O firmware.
- Specifically, the `SmiHandler` function within the driver allows for memory corruption in System Management RAM (SMRAM) due to insufficient input validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SMRAM Write Vulnerability:** The `SmiHandler` calls the `SmfbFunc2` or `SmfbFunc3` functions with arguments derived from a communication buffer. These functions write to memory locations specified by the `addr` parameter, which is not validated. This enables writing to arbitrary locations within SMRAM.
- The `SmfbFunc2` function has two code paths that can be triggered. The first one in `sub_800027F8` allows writing a controllable byte to SMRAM and the second one in `sub_80002BFC` allows writing fixed bytes to SMRAM.
- The `SmfbFunc3` function allows writing fixed bytes to SMRAM.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges from ring 0 (OS kernel) to ring -2 (SMM).
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code within SMM, which is a highly privileged environment isolated from the OS.
- **Firmware Backdoor/Implant:** Exploiting the vulnerability enables bypassing SMM-based SPI flash protections, which could lead to the installation of a persistent firmware backdoor or implant within the BIOS. This could survive OS reinstalls.
- **Bypass Security Mechanisms:** Attackers could potentially bypass security mechanisms implemented by UEFI firmware, such as Secure Boot and memory isolation for hypervisors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SMI (System Management Interrupt) Handler:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted SMI that invokes the vulnerable `SmiHandler`.
- **Communication Buffer Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the communication buffer passed to the `SmiHandler` to control the arguments used by `SmfbFunc2` or `SmfbFunc3`, including the target address for writing within SMRAM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Code Execution in DXE Phase:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code during the DXE (Driver Execution Environment) phase of the UEFI boot process. This is before the operating system is loaded.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Driver:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable `FwBlockServiceSmm` driver and its associated GUIDs.
- **SMI Triggering:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted SMI to trigger the vulnerable handler.
- **Controlled Communication Buffer:** The attacker must be able to prepare a controlled communication buffer to specify the destination address and data to be written to SMRAM.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Binarly efiXplorer team and reported to Insyde.
- Insyde has released fixes for different kernel versions of their InsydeH2O firmware.
- Binarly has published a FwHunt rule to detect this vulnerability: [BRLY-2022-024](https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/blob/main/rules/Vulnerabilities/Insyde/BRLY-2022-024.yml)
