  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin lacks proper CSRF protection.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious actor can force higher-privileged users to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious actor can craft a request that, when triggered by a logged-in user, executes unintended actions on the user's behalf.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in, higher-privileged user into executing the malicious request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
