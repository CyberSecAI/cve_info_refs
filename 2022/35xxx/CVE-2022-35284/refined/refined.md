- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) v10.0.2 does not set the `SameSite` attribute in the ISIQ session cookie.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing `SameSite` attribute in the session cookie, which disables CSRF protections offered by the attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Disabling of CSRF protections, which could potentially allow Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation of the lack of `SameSite` attribute through a malicious website or application that triggers a cross-site request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with malicious content that triggers a request against the vulnerable ISIQ application.
