The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35998.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tf.raw_ops.EmptyTensorList` operation in TensorFlow does not properly validate the shape of the `element_shape` input. Specifically, it fails if the input `element_shape` has more than one dimension, leading to a `CHECK` failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation of the `element_shape` parameter in the `EmptyTensorList` operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A denial of service (DoS) attack can be triggered by providing an invalid `element_shape` input to the `EmptyTensorList` operation, leading to a `CHECK` fail and potentially crashing the TensorFlow process.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through a specially crafted call to `tf.raw_ops.EmptyTensorList`, where the `element_shape` has more than one dimension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the TensorFlow model, specifically to control the `element_shape` parameter of the `tf.raw_ops.EmptyTensorList` function call.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in TensorFlow versions 2.10.0, 2.9.2, 2.8.3, and 2.7.4.
- The fix involves adding a check to validate if the `element_shape` is valid before using it in `EmptyTensorList`.
- The vulnerability is present in both graph mode and eager mode but was only exploitable in eager mode before the fix.
