Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the `QuantizedMatMul` operation in TensorFlow not properly validating the input shapes of the `min_a`, `max_a`, `min_b`, and `max_b` parameters. These parameters are expected to be scalar values but the code does not enforce this, leading to a segfault when non-scalar values are provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper input shape validation for the quantization parameters (`min_a`, `max_a`, `min_b`, `max_b`).
- **Segfault:** When non-scalar values are provided for these parameters, it causes a segmentation fault, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by triggering a crash of the TensorFlow process. This can be achieved by providing a crafted input to the `QuantizedMatMul` operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** The attack vector involves providing crafted, non-scalar values for the `min_a`, `max_a`, `min_b`, and `max_b` parameters of the `QuantizedMatMul` operation.
- **API Call:** The attacker would need to call the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizedMatMul` API with the malicious inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters to the `QuantizedMatMul` operation within a TensorFlow environment.
- They need to be able to construct and execute a TensorFlow graph or session.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding checks to ensure that the `min_a`, `max_a`, `min_b`, and `max_b` inputs are indeed scalar values.
- The provided commit `aca766ac7693bf29ed0df55ad6bfcc78f35e7f48` addresses this issue.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0. Patched versions include 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2 and 2.10.0.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
