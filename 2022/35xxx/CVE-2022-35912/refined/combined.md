# Grails Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

By Puneet Behl and Jason Schindler

July 18, 2022

**Grails Framework information regarding CVE-2022-35912**

## Updates

### July 20th, 2022

Updated impacted Grails framework versions.

## Overview

The Grails team has confirmed a critical security vulnerability reported by meizjm3i and codeplutos of AntGroup FG Security Lab. This vulnerability has been assigned identifier [CVE-2022-35912](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35912).

The vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely execute code within a Grails application runtime by issuing a specially crafted web request that grants the attacker access to the class loader. This attack exploits a section of the Grails data-binding logic. Grails data-binding is invoked in a number of ways including the creation of command objects, domain class construction, and manual data binding when using `bindData`. For a full description, please refer to [the data-binding documentation](https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#dataBinding).

## Impacted Applications

* Grails framework versions
  + >= 3.3.10 & < 3.3.15
  + >= 4.0.0 & < 4.1.1
  + >= 5.0.0 & < 5.1.9
  + 5.2.0
* Running on Java 8
* Using embedded Tomcat runtime, as well as those deployed to a Servlet Container

We have confirmed this vulnerability on Grails framework versions 3.3.10 and higher (including Grails framework 4 and 5) that are running on Java 8. The vulnerability has been observed in both the embedded Tomcat runtime and applications deployed as a war to a Tomcat instance.

Due to the nature of this vulnerability, we strongly suggest that all Grails applications, *including those that are not vulnerable to this specific attack*, be updated to a patched Grails release. While we have not been able to reproduce this specific exploit on applications running in Java 11 or in versions of the Grails framework before 3.3.10, the nature of the vulnerability is such that variations on the attack could be discovered that earlier Grails releases, and Grails applications running on higher versions of Java, will be impacted.

## Protecting Your Applications

The following Grails framework versions have been patched for this vulnerability:

* 5.2.1
* 5.1.9
* 4.1.1
* 3.3.15

The best way to protect your Grails applications is to upgrade to a patched release of the framework.

Grails 4.x applications can be upgraded to version 4.1.1 or higher, and Grails 5.0.x and 5.1.x applications can be upgraded to 5.1.9 or higher, and Grails 5.2 applications can be upgraded to 5.2.1 or higher.

## Protecting Grails 3 Applications

For Grails 3 applications, we have released Grails framework 3.3.15, which includes a patch for this vulnerability (please note that Grails framework version 3 has reached end of support, and we strongly recommend that all Grails 3 applications be upgraded to an actively maintained version of the framework).

## Protecting Grails 2 Applications

As mentioned above, this specific attack is enabled by code added in version 3.3.10 of the Grails framework, so Grails framework version 2 applications are not vulnerable to it. Due to the nature of the exploit, we strongly suggest that you upgrade your Grails applications to a patched and supported version of the framework. Grails framework version 2 has reached end of support.

## Next Steps

The Grails Foundation and the Grails core development team take application security very seriously. We are continuing to research and monitor this vulnerability and will update this post with new information as it is discovered.

| [@erichelgeson](https://github.com/erichelgeson)  Could you provide an example of the vulnerability (I don't see any tests or info in the CVE)?  We haven't yet published the technical mechanics of this attack yet as we are trying to provide folks some time to upgrade before the attack becomes more broadly known. We will be publishing the details soon. We are identifying a timeline for that to become public.  I need to backport this to 3.3.9 as there are breaking changes preventing me from moving to anything higher  If you aren't able to upgrade your application, for a 3.3.9 app you could get the patched databinding library by adding the updated dependency explicitly to your build.gradle:  ``` compile "org.grails:grails-databinding:3.3.15" ``` |

| As a systems administrator (not developer), what's the best method to detect vulnerable versions? A filesystem scan for grails-databinding-5.2.x.jar? Along with 5.2 less than 5.2.1, 5.1 less than 5.1.9, 4.1 less than 4.1.1, and 3.3 less than 3.3.15? Is that the correct naming convention? |

| We have identified the change that allows this attack to succeed, and it was added in version 3.3.10. Grails framework versions below 3.3.10 are not vulnerable to this specific attack. Due to the nature of the attack, it is possible that a variation could be discovered that does impact Grails framework versions 3.3.9 and lower. We strongly suggest that all Grails applications be upgraded to a patched and supported version of the framework. More info is on the updated blog post: <https://grails.org/blog/2022-07-18-rce-vulnerability.html>  (cc [@erichelgeson](https://github.com/erichelgeson) ) |

Will the above mentioned patched 3.3.15 version of databinding library work in Grails 2.5.6 environment?  That is quite a jump. I would not expect that to work. Even if it builds and runs, there are likely other breaking changes in the way that databinding is handled that may impact you. |

The full known set of impacted versions are: >= 3.3.10 & < 3.3.15 ; >= 4.0.0 & < 4.1.1 ; >= 5.0.0 & < 5.1.9 ; 5.2.0  I can't say if this is the "best method" for your environment, but looking for a grails-databinding.jar in those version ranges should work. Please note that in most cases these applications will be packaged as a war which includes the jar inside of it so it may not be visible on the filesystem without extracting the contents of the war file. |

If so, will specific versions of Tomcat be listed as a prerequisite for this vector?  Note that, just like spring4shell, the key aspect is the access to the classloader. Upgrading tomcat addressed one of the attack vectors in spring4shell, but once you are able to modify anything in the classloader, there are multiple attack vectors that can be explored. |

Is this a acceptable workaround to patch older projects to gain some more time to upgrade?  If you are in a position where you are able to add an updated file to a src folder, I suspect you could also upgrade the Grails version of your project. If there are reasons that you are unable to do that in the short term, you could try upgrading only the `grails-databinding` dependency as described above. |

| [@JasonTypesCodes](https://github.com/JasonTypesCodes) , we've got a vendor that is saying their patches for this issue are still a week out. I appreciate that you're not publishing PoCs or specifics, but can you indicate whether we're looking at a log4shell type of deal, or a lower-risk situation? Trying to figure if we need to take production systems offline until patches drop. |

| can you indicate whether we're looking at a log4shell type of deal, or a lower-risk situation?  [@chrismyers81](https://github.com/chrismyers81) This vulnerability is an RCE which is short for remote code execution. That means that someone that knows how to exercise the attack can cause a vulnerable system to execute arbitrary code from over a network. |

| [@JasonTypesCodes](https://github.com/JasonTypesCodes), true. But some RCEs only cause issues if, say, feature X is being used. Or, they cause issues if certain complex conditions are met. Others like log4shell cause issues simply because the library is loaded.  In lieu of specifics, can you provide a cvss? NVD doesn't have an analysis yet. |

Others like log4shell cause issues simply because the library is loaded.  In lieu of specifics, can you provide a cvss? NVD doesn't have an analysis yet.  This vulnerability is in the Grails data binding logic which can be used to bind a map of data (like the params from an incoming web request) to an object. This could be done explicitly in your application code, or implicitly by the framework if you are using features like command objects. Many Grails applications make use of the data binding logic.  <https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#dataBinding>  If you inspect your application looking for use of data binding, please remember that plugins can introduce controllers and may be using data binding as well. |

Subject: Grails Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, CVE-2022-35912

I haven't seen this posted yet, so I'm just passing along.

The Grails team has confirmed a critical security vulnerability reported by meizjm3i and codeplutos of AntGroup FG Security Lab. This vulnerability has been assigned identifier CVE-2022-35912<<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35912>>.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely execute code within a Grails application runtime by issuing a specially crafted web request that grants the attacker access to the class loader. This attack exploits a section of the Grails data-binding logic. Grails data-binding is invoked in a number of ways including the creation of command objects, domain class construction, and manual data binding when using bindData. For a full description, please refer to the data-binding documentation<<https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/theWebLayer.html#dataBinding>>.
