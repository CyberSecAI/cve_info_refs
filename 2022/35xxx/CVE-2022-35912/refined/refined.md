Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the Grails framework's data-binding logic. Specifically, it stems from a flaw in how the framework handles web requests when binding data to objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A specially crafted web request can grant an attacker access to the class loader, allowing them to execute arbitrary code within the Grails application's runtime. This access is achieved through exploitation of the data-binding logic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows for remote execution of arbitrary code, potentially leading to full control of the server, data breaches, and other severe consequences.
- **Data Access/Manipulation:** The attacker could read or modify sensitive data stored in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted web requests:** An attacker crafts malicious requests that exploit the vulnerable data-binding process. These requests can be sent via HTTP to any vulnerable application exposed over the network.
- **Data Binding Mechanisms:** The vulnerability can be triggered through various data binding mechanisms, including:
    - Creation of command objects
    - Domain class construction
    - Manual data binding using `bindData`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Grails application.
- **Knowledge of Data Binding:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to craft a malicious web request to exploit the data binding logic.

**Additional Information:**
-  The vulnerability affects Grails versions 3.3.10 and higher up to 5.2.0
-  It affects applications running on Java 8.
- The vulnerability has been observed in both embedded Tomcat and applications deployed to Tomcat.
- Grails 2 applications are not vulnerable to the specific attack vector, but it is recommended to upgrade to avoid any variations of the attack.
- The vulnerability is considered critical, with a CVSS score of 10 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- Mitigations include upgrading to a patched version of Grails.
- There's a suggestion that upgrading Tomcat versions is not a mitigation.
- The exact details of the exploit are not yet public, to allow for patching.
- A workaround is to explicitly add the updated `grails-databinding` library to the build.gradle, for those who cannot upgrade right away
