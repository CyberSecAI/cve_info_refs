The content is related to CVE-2022-35266.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `hashFirst` function of the embedthis GoAhead library (version 4.0.0) used by the Robustel R1510 web server. The function does not properly validate the input `WebsHash` value, which is used as an index to access an array. If the `WebsHash` value is out of the valid range (e.g., -1 when no file is included in the request), it leads to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the array using this invalid index, causing a segmentation fault and crashing the web server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125) due to missing input validation in the `hashFirst` function.
- The `assert` macro used in the code does not halt execution when the input is out of bounds, as it is configured to just print an error message in debug mode and do nothing in non-debug mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) of the web server due to a segmentation fault and crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to specific API endpoints that use the vulnerable `hashFirst` function. The request should not include a file upload or any data related to `webs->files` to cause the `webs->files` to be -1.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device. This likely means network access, but not necessarily internal network access as the device is a router.
