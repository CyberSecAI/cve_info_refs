- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `hashFirst` function of the GoAhead web server library (version 4.0.0) used by the Robustel R1510 router. This function doesn't properly validate the `WebsHash` input, which is an index for an array access. If the value is out of bounds, it leads to a segmentation fault.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Out-of-bounds read due to insufficient input validation in the `hashFirst` function. Specifically, the function uses an index (`sd`) to access an array without checking for negative values.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack leads to a denial-of-service condition by crashing the web server.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is sending a crafted POST request to the `/action/import_aaa_cert_file/` API without including any files. This causes the `webs->files` value to be -1, which is then passed to the `hashFirst` function, resulting in an out-of-bounds array access.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web server of the Robustel R1510 router. It's stated that the attacker must send a sequence of requests to trigger the vulnerability, suggesting it might not be directly exploitable with a single request.
