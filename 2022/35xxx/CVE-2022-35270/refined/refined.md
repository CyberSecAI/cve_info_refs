The content is related to CVE-2022-35270.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `hashFirst` function of the GoAhead web server library used by Robustel R1510 routers. The `hashFirst` function receives a `WebsHash` value as an index, which is not properly validated. If the index is out of range (e.g., -1), it will cause a segmentation fault when accessing the `sym` array, leading to a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- Insufficient input validation of the `WebsHash` value passed to the `hashFirst` function.
- The `assert` function used does not halt execution when a condition is false.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) - The web server crashes, rendering the device inaccessible via the web interface.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially-crafted POST request to the `/action/import_wireguard_cert_file/` API without including any files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the Robustel R1510 device.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to send a POST request to the specific vulnerable API endpoint.
