Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-35630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the generation of HTML collection reports. The server does not properly sanitize the input when creating these reports, which allows a malicious client to inject JavaScript code into the generated HTML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe HTML injection: The application does not sanitize data before embedding it in the HTML report.
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the HTML report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The injected JavaScript code could execute when a user opens the HTML report in their browser.
- Although the file is served locally (from a `file://` URL), this could still enable phishing attacks, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's local file system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious Velociraptor client sends specially crafted data to the server.
- The server includes this unsanitized data in the generated HTML report.
- A user downloads and opens the malicious HTML file in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious Velociraptor client.
- The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted data to the Velociraptor server.
