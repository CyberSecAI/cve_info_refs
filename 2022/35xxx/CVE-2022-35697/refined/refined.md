Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of SVG image uploads in the `AdaptiveImageServlet`. Malicious Javascript code embedded within a crafted SVG image is not being properly neutralized, leading to reflected XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- Improper sanitization/validation of user-supplied SVG image data

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker, with author access, can upload a malicious SVG image.
- When a victim (another authenticated user) loads the crafted image, the embedded JavaScript is executed in their browser context.
- This allows the attacker to potentially gain access to the victim's session, leading to unauthorized actions or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted SVG image containing malicious JavaScript via the `AdaptiveImageServlet`.
- The attacker would then need to lure a victim to view the malicious image through the generated link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have "author access" to upload images.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim to load the malicious image.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to 2.20.8.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `AdaptiveImageServlet`.
- The provided document includes CVE ID, CWE ID and github advisory.
