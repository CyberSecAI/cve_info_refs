# Security Bulletin: IBM PowerVM VIOS could allow a remote attacker to tamper with system configuration or cause a denial of service (CVE-2022-35643)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

A vulnerability in IBM PowerVM VIOS could allow a remote attacker to tamper with system configuration or cause a denial of service (CVE-2022-35643).

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2022-35643](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-35643)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| PowerVM VIOS | 3.1 |

The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

| Fileset | Lower Level | Upper Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| devices.vtdev.scsi.rte | 7.2.4.0 | 7.2.4.4 |
| devices.vtdev.scsi.rte | 7.2.5.0 | 7.2.5.3 |

## Remediation/Fixes

**A. APARS**

IBM has assigned the following APARs to this problem:

| VIOS Level | APAR | SP |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3.1.1 | IJ40954 | N/A |
| 3.1.2 | IJ40951 | 3.1.2.50 |
| 3.1.3 | IJ40952 | 3.1.3.30 |

Subscribe to the APARs here:

<https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/IJ40951>
<https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/IJ40952>
<https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/apar/IJ40954>

By subscribing, you will receive periodic email alerting you to the status of the APAR, and a link to download the fix once it becomes available.

**B. FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

The fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/vios\_fix.tar
<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/vios_fix.tar>
<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/vios_fix.tar>

The links above are to a tar file containing this signed advisory, fix packages, and OpenSSL signatures for each package. The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and VIOS level.

| VIOS Level | Interim Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 3.1.1.30 | IJ40954s3a.220711.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.1.40 | IJ40954s4a.220711.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.1.50 | IJ40954s5a.220711.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.2.10 | IJ40951s1a.220711.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.2.21 | IJ40951s2a.220711.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.2.30 | IJ40951s3a.220711.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.3.10 | IJ40952s3b.220712.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.3.14 | IJ40952s3a.220712.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.3.21 | IJ40952s4a.220712.epkg.Z |

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

tar xvf vios\_fix.tar
cd vios\_fix

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [file]" command as the following:

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes. If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM VIOS Support at <https://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

**C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION**

Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression testing but not the full regression testing that takes place for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html>

To preview an interim fix installation:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -p         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being previewed.

To install an interim fix package:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -X         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being installed.
