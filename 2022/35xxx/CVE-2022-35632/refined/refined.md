- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Velociraptor GUI's editor suggestion feature, which displays descriptions of VQL functions, plugins, or artifacts, did not properly sanitize the description field, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized input in the description field.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code, potentially leading to client-side attacks when a user views the unsanitized description. This could include session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker could create or modify an artifact (prior to version 0.6.5) with malicious HTML in the description field. This malicious artifact would then be displayed within the vulnerable GUI element.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - For versions prior to 0.6.5, the attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the `ARTIFACT_WRITER` permission (typically an administrator).
  - For versions 0.6.5 and later, the artifact description is no longer used in the vulnerable section, and therefore, the vulnerability cannot be exploited.
