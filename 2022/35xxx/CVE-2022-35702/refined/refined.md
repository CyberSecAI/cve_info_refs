- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to read memory outside of the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attack complexity is low (AC:L), no privileges are required (PR:N) and user interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system and requires the user to open a malicious file.
