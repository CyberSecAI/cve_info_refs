Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35118:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content includes a CVE list that explicitly mentions "CVE-2022-35118" with the description "Multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)" in "PyroCMS 3.9 and earlier". This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the description indicates that the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the PyroCMS application. This allows malicious scripts to be injected and stored within the application's database.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is not just reflected back to the user in a specific request, but is instead permanently stored in the system and executed whenever a user views the compromised data. This is a more severe form of XSS, as it impacts all users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who access the affected parts of the PyroCMS application.
    *   This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
        *   **Account hijacking**: Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to accounts.
        *   **Data theft**: Reading and exfiltrating sensitive data, including those stored in the system.
        *   **Phishing**: Redirecting users to phishing pages, tricking them into revealing their credentials.
        *   **Malware distribution:** Injecting scripts that download and execute malware on the user's computer.
        *   **Defacement:** Modifying website content for malicious purposes.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized by the PyroCMS application.
    *   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into data fields that are subsequently stored in the database (e.g., in blog posts, user profiles, or other fields that can store user inputted data).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to inject or post data to the affected fields in PyroCMS. This might be as simple as having an account that can write content, depending on the specific injection points.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content provides more detail than the official CVE description (which is a placeholder), clarifying the vulnerability type as multiple stored XSS.
*  The "Fixed in" column states "N/A" which likely means that there is no update for this vulnerability, and the system is end-of-life.
