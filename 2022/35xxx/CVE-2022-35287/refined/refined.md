- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of YAML files and property files with hard-coded credentials in IBM Security Verify Information Queue (ISIQ) v10.0.2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Hard-coded credentials within configuration files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The presence of hard-coded credentials could potentially lead to unauthorized access or further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker who gains access to the configuration files could leverage the hard-coded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the ISIQ installation package, or the deployed files.
