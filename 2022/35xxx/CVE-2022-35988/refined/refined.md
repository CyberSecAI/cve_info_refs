Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35988:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the GPU kernel of `tf.linalg.matrix_rank` when processing an empty input tensor. Specifically, when the input tensor has zero batches, the GPU kernel previously failed a `work_element_count > 0` check. This check failure resulted in a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper handling for empty input tensors in the GPU kernel of `tf.linalg.matrix_rank`.
- A `CHECK` failure in the GPU kernel when processing empty batches.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can trigger a crash of the TensorFlow application by providing an empty input to `tf.linalg.matrix_rank`.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specifically crafted, empty tensor to the `tf.linalg.matrix_rank` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to pass inputs to the `tf.linalg.matrix_rank` function, either through direct calls or as part of a larger TensorFlow model.

**Additional notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check for zero batches and returning early in such cases, avoiding the check failure in the GPU kernel. The fix was included in commit [c55b476aa0e0bd4ee99d0f3ad18d9d706cd1260a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c55b476aa0e0bd4ee99d0f3ad18d9d706cd1260a).
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The issue was reported by Kang Hong Jin.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0 and is patched in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
