The provided content describes multiple crashes found in the JPEGDEC library through fuzzing. These crashes include negative-size-parameter errors, segmentation faults (SEGV) on unknown addresses, global buffer overflows, and floating-point exceptions (FPE).

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Negative-size-param:** A negative size parameter is passed to `memcpy`, leading to a crash.
*  **SEGV on unknown address:** Several instances of segmentation faults occur due to invalid memory access during TIFF processing and file seeking operations.
*   **Global Buffer Overflow:** The code writes data beyond the allocated boundaries of global buffers, leading to memory corruption.
*   **FPE:** A floating-point exception is triggered during the decoding process.

**Root Cause:**

*   **Negative size:** Invalid handling of size parameters in `memcpy` within `JPEGParseInfo`.
*   **Invalid Memory Access:** Issues during TIFF info retrieval (`GetTIFFInfo`, `TIFFSHORT`), and file seeking (`seekFile`) result in reading from or writing to invalid memory locations.
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Improper bounds checking in `JPEGPutMCU8BitGray` and `JPEGDecodeMCU` leading to writing/reading beyond buffer limits.
*   **Division by Zero/Invalid Calculation:** A division by zero or other invalid calculation during decoding, leading to an FPE.

**Impact:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crashes can lead to program termination, causing a denial of service.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Buffer overflows can corrupt data, potentially leading to further exploitable behavior.
*   **Unpredictable Behavior:** Invalid memory access can lead to unpredictable program behavior, including crashes.
*   **Potential Remote Code Execution:** Although not explicitly stated, the described memory corruption vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited to achieve remote code execution with further analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted JPEG files:** By providing specially crafted JPEG files, an attacker can trigger these vulnerabilities.
*   **Fuzzing:** As mentioned, fuzzing was used to discover these vulnerabilities.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Ability to provide input to the JPEG decoder (e.g., through a file upload or other input mechanism).
*   No special privileges are required to trigger the crashes.
