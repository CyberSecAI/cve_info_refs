Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35967:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `QuantizedAdd` operation within TensorFlow. The code did not properly validate the rank of the `min_input` and `max_input` tensors, expecting them to be scalar (rank 0) tensors. When tensors of non-zero rank were provided for these inputs, it caused a segfault. This lack of input validation is the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The core weakness is the absence of proper checks to ensure the `min_input` and `max_input` tensors are scalar, as required by the `QuantizedAdd` operation.
- **Segfault:** Input tensors of non-zero rank for `min_input` and `max_input` lead to a segmentation fault due to the code trying to access scalar values from non-scalar tensors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The segfault can be triggered by an attacker, leading to a crash of the TensorFlow application. This can result in a denial of service, preventing legitimate users from using the application or system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `QuantizedAdd` operation. By crafting input tensors where `min_input` and `max_input` have non-zero ranks, an attacker can trigger the segfault.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide inputs to the `QuantizedAdd` operation. This implies a position where the attacker can control the tensors passed to the TensorFlow graph. This could be achieved in various ways depending on how TensorFlow is used (e.g., through a model exposed as an API endpoint).
- Specifically, the attacker needs to provide `min_input` and `max_input` tensors that are not scalars (i.e. have a rank greater than 0).

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions before 2.10.0.
- **Patched Versions:** Patches have been released in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- **Code fix:** The code fix involved adding explicit checks to verify that `min_input` and `max_input` tensors are indeed scalar tensors using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar`.
- The provided code snippet demonstrates how an attacker could trigger the segfault by providing rank 0 tensors for `min_x` and `min_y`.
- The commit log also shows the corresponding changes to the test suite, adding tests that specifically check for the correct behaviour when invalid input shapes are provided.
