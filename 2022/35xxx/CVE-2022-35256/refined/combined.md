CVE ID         : CVE-2022-32212 CVE-2022-32213 CVE-2022-32214 CVE-2022-32215
                 CVE-2022-35255 CVE-2022-35256 CVE-2022-43548

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Node.js, which could result
in HTTP request smuggling, bypass of host IP address validation and weak
randomness setup.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 12.22.12~dfsg-1~deb11u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your nodejs packages.

For the detailed security status of nodejs please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/nodejs>

SSA-332410: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SINEC INS before V1.0 SP2
Update 1

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.9

2023-01-10
2023-01-10
V1.0

SUMMARY

Siemens has released a new version for SINEC INS that ﬁxes multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an
attacker to read and write arbitrary ﬁles from the ﬁle system of the affected component and to ultimately
execute arbitrary code on the device. In addition, this version also contains ﬁxes for multiple vulnerabilities
in underlying third party components.

Siemens has released an update for SINEC INS and recommends to update to the latest version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• CVE-2022-45093: Disable the SFTP service of the affected product, if not required
• CVE-2022-45094: Disable the DHCP service of the affected product, if not required

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliﬁes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-2068

In addition to the c_rehash shell command injection identiﬁed in CVE-2022-1292, further circumstances
where the c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command
injection were found by code review. When the CVE-2022-1292 was ﬁxed it was not discovered that
there are other places in the script where the ﬁle names of certiﬁcates being hashed were possibly
passed to a command executed through the shell. This script is distributed by some operating systems
in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete
and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool.

Command (’OS Command Injection’)

Vulnerability CVE-2022-2097

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not
encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data
that was preexisting in the memory that wasn’t written. In the special case of “in place” encryption,
sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher
suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-2274

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA implementation for X86_64 CPUs
supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions. This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit
private keys incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during the computation.
As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker may be able to trigger a remote code
execution on the machine performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using
2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA instructions of the X86_64
architecture are affected by this issue.

Vulnerability CVE-2022-32212

A OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in Node.js versions <14.20.0, <16.16.0, <18.5.0 due
to an insufﬁcient IsAllowedHost check that can easily be bypassed because IsIPAddress does not
properly check if an IP address is invalid before making DBS requests allowing rebinding attacks.
