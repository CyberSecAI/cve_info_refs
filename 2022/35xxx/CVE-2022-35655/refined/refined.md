The provided content is a security advisory from Pega regarding multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2022-35655.

**CVE-2022-35655 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Software:** Pega Platform
*   **Affected Versions:** 7.3 to 8.7.3

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is a reflected XSS vulnerability, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a website through a crafted request.

**Weaknesses:**
The vulnerability lies in how the application handles user input, specifically with the `pzGetDataPageJSON` activity and the JavaScript API `pega.api.ui.actions.getDataPage()`. It does not properly sanitize or validate data, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts. The HTML rule `pyPublicDataPageWhiteList` was introduced as a control.

**Impact:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, or unauthorized data access.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a crafted request to the application containing malicious scripts. The server reflects this unsanitized input back to the user's browser. The reflected XSS vulnerability can be triggered using the `pzGetDataPageJSON` activity and the JavaScript API `pega.api.ui.actions.getDataPage()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request and entice the user to interact with it (e.g., by clicking on a link). An authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the Data Pages called by the API.

**Mitigation:**
The advisory suggests a local change solution which involves reviewing the `pyPublicDataPageWhiteList` HTML rule and adjusting it based on the application usage of `pega.api.ui.actions.getDataPage()`. If `pega.api.ui.actions.getDataPage()` is not used, the rule can be emptied, which will prevent API calls from returning data. If the API is used, it is recommended to use non-parameterized data pages, and specify them in the `pyPublicDataPageWhiteList`. Hotfixes were also released.

**Additional Information:**
The advisory also mentions that Pega Cloud clients are being proactively remediated by Pega, while on-premises clients should apply the appropriate hotfixes.  It is also noted that this vulnerability is addressed in newer versions of the software (8.6.6, 8.7.4, 8.8).
