The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities discovered in the `PNGdec` repository, specifically related to processing of PNG images. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Floating Point Exception (FPE) Crash**

*   **Root Cause:** A division by zero or similar floating-point error within the `SaveBMP` function.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of potential floating-point exceptions when converting image data to BMP format.
*   **Impact:** Program crash due to the unhandled FPE.
*   **Attack Vector:** Inputting a specially crafted PNG image that triggers the problematic calculation.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to provide the vulnerable program with a crafted PNG file.

**2. Heap-Based Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple instances of heap buffer overflows. These occur in `SaveBMP` when writing to the BMP file, and during `memcpy` in `DecodePNG`.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when writing image data to a buffer, and also when decoding PNG data, leading to writes outside the allocated memory.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Inputting a crafted PNG image with specific dimensions or encoded data that leads to the overflow during processing/conversion.
*    **Attacker Capability:** Ability to provide the vulnerable program with a crafted PNG file.

**3. Stack-Based Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack buffer overflow in the `SaveBMP` function when writing image data to a stack allocated buffer named `ucTemp76`.
*  **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when writing to a stack-allocated buffer.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption on the stack, potentially leading to control-flow hijacking.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Specially crafted PNG image that leads to an oversized buffer write during the BMP saving process.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to provide the vulnerable program with a crafted PNG file.

**4. Global-Based Buffer Overflow**
*   **Root Cause:** A global buffer overflow in the `inflate_fast` function, which is part of the zlib inflation process in `DecodePNG`.
*   **Weakness:** The size of a global buffer named `png` is not checked against the size needed by the inflation algorithm, causing a write past the buffer.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, leading to potential program instability or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted PNG image that, when deflated, requires more space than the global buffer provides.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to provide the vulnerable program with a crafted PNG file.

**5. Memory Allocation Failure (Crash)**

*  **Root Cause:** The program attempts to allocate an extremely large amount of memory, exceeding the maximum supported by the system.
*  **Weakness:**  Lack of proper input validation or size checking when determining the amount of memory needed, leading to a request that cannot be fulfilled.
*   **Impact:** Program termination due to memory allocation failure.
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted PNG image that leads to the program attempting to allocate an invalid memory size.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to provide the vulnerable program with a crafted PNG file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issues were found using AddressSanitizer, which detected various memory corruption issues and allocation errors.
*   A patch was provided to dynamically allocate `ucTemp` in `main.cpp` to fix the stack-based buffer overflow. The reported fix was to dynamically allocate the buffer with a size based on `lsize` rather than using a fixed 2048 byte buffer.
* The issue was marked as resolved.
* The crashes occur when saving as BMP format.
