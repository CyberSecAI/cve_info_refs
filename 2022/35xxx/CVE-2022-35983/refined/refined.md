Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `tf.raw_ops.Save` and `tf.raw_ops.SaveSlices` operations in TensorFlow not properly handling tensors with unsupported data types (dtypes). When these operations encounter an unsupported dtype, they trigger a `CHECK` fail.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of input validation:** The code does not validate the data type of the tensors being passed to the `Save` and `SaveSlices` operations.
- **Uncaught exception/error:** When an unsupported data type is encountered, instead of gracefully handling the error, the code triggers a `CHECK` fail, which leads to a program termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing tensors with unsupported data types to these functions, an attacker can cause the TensorFlow process to terminate unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can construct a TensorFlow graph that includes `tf.raw_ops.Save` or `tf.raw_ops.SaveSlices` operations with tensors that have unsupported dtypes, causing the program to crash during execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the TensorFlow model such that the vulnerable operations are called with a tensor of an unsupported dtype. This might involve crafting specific input data or manipulating the data type before it is passed to the vulnerable function.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit ([5dd7b86b84a864b834c6fa3d7f9f51c87efa99d4](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5dd7b86b84a864b834c6fa3d7f9f51c87efa99d4)) addresses this issue by adding a check to ensure the data type is supported and emitting a descriptive error if it is not, thus preventing the `CHECK` fail and the resulting denial of service.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0, but the fix has been backported to versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, and 2.9.2 as well.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Low."
