- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `hashFirst` function in the GoAhead web server library doesn't properly validate the input `WebsHash` value, leading to an out-of-bounds read. Specifically, when the `webs->files` value is -1 (e.g., when no file is included in the POST request), this negative value is used as an index into the `sym` array, causing a segmentation fault. The `assert` macro does not prevent this out of bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read in the `hashFirst` function. Lack of input validation on the `WebsHash` value. The use of a non-standard `assert` macro that does not prevent out of bound reads.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service. The web server crashes due to a segmentation fault, making the device inaccessible.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to the vulnerable API endpoints (`/action/import_file/` in the case of CVE-2022-35263) without including a file, causing the `webs->files` to be set to -1.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the web server. No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.
