Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an **Out-of-bounds Read** issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-125:** Out-of-bounds Read. This occurs when the software reads data from memory locations outside the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the affected system. This means an attacker can potentially gain full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system or have the user execute a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is of low complexity, indicating that it is relatively easy to exploit once the attacker has the required access/ability to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** User interaction is required to trigger the exploit. This often means the user needs to open a malicious file or perform some action in the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system or be able to entice a user to open a specially crafted file.
*   The attacker would likely need to create a malicious file that exploits the out-of-bounds read condition in Adobe Bridge.

**Summary of the CVE entry:**

CVE-2022-35707 is a critical vulnerability found in Adobe Bridge that stems from an out-of-bounds read. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker needs local access and requires user interaction. The provided CVSS score is 7.8, classifying it as a high severity vulnerability.
