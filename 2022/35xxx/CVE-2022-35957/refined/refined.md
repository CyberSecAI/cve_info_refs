Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35957:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2022-35957. Multiple sources, including the Fedora Project mailing list, Red Hat Bugzilla, NetApp security advisory, Grafana documentation, and GitHub advisories explicitly mention this CVE ID, describing it as a vulnerability in Grafana where an admin user can escalate privileges to server admin when an auth proxy is used.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper handling of the `X-WEBAUTH-USER` header in combination with Grafana's data source proxy feature when auth proxy authentication is enabled.

*   **Auth Proxy:**  Grafana allows authentication via a reverse proxy, trusting the proxy to validate the user and forward the username in the `X-WEBAUTH-USER` header.
*   **Data Source Proxy:** Grafana's data source proxy allows configuration of data sources that may point to localhost, which can be used to make requests back to itself.
*   **Vulnerability:** By configuring a data source proxy to point to the Grafana server with an admin username in the `X-WEBAUTH-USER` header, a lower-privileged user (or even an unauthenticated attacker) can use this proxy to gain server admin privileges through the data source proxy.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Authentication Handling:** The vulnerability stems from trusting the `X-WEBAUTH-USER` header provided by a front-end proxy without additional checks in the context of data source proxy requests.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  An admin user can escalate to server admin by exploiting the data source proxy when auth proxy is enabled, bypassing intended access controls.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `X-WEBAUTH-USER` header in data source proxy requests to prevent injection of elevated privileges.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges from admin to server admin, gaining complete control of the Grafana instance.
*   **Data Access & Modification:** As server admin, an attacker would gain access to all data, configurations, and user settings within the Grafana instance, allowing them to view sensitive information and potentially modify data.
*   **System Takeover:** With full access to the Grafana instance, an attacker could potentially compromise the underlying system hosting Grafana, depending on its configuration and connectivity to other systems.
*   **Denial of Service:** An attacker could abuse the server admin privileges to disrupt Grafana service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Data Source Proxy:** The attack vector involves using Grafana's data source proxy to make a request to the Grafana server with an altered `X-WEBAUTH-USER` header.
*   **Authentication Proxy:** The exploitation requires that the Grafana instance have the auth proxy authentication method enabled.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker typically needs admin access in a vulnerable Grafana instance that utilizes auth proxy.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Grafana server.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:**  The attacker must be aware of the vulnerability and its exploitation method.
*   **Ability to create/modify datasources:** To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker would need the ability to create or modify datasources within Grafana. This could be done either via the UI, or some other means such as API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is mitigated by upgrading to Grafana versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, or 9.1.6 and later.
*   A workaround includes disabling the auth proxy if upgrading isn't immediately feasible.
*   The vulnerability affects Grafana instances using the auth proxy feature.
*   Patches for the vulnerability were applied to Grafana Cloud.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that their products are not affected by this vulnerability, but that multiple other products incorporate Grafana which were potentially vulnerable.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.6 MEDIUM.
*   The GitHub advisory states the severity as High, with a CVSS score of 7.5.
