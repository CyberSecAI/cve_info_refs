Fix GPU/CPU Conv2DBackpropInputOp check error.

```
For empty `out_backprop` inputs (e.g. `[3, 1, 0, 1]`), the current
CPU/GPU kernels fail (one with dnnl, the other with cudnn). Added
a shortcut path to return a zero input.

Note that the XLA test currently fails due to an incorrect result
size bug (b/239598470), so it is currently disabled.

# `CHECK` fail in `Conv2DBackpropInput`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-37jf-mjv6-xfqw
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

When `Conv2DBackpropInput` receives empty `out_backprop` inputs (e.g. `[3, 1, 0, 1]`), the current CPU/GPU kernels `CHECK` fail (one with dnnl, the other with cudnn). This can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
input_sizes = [3, 1, 1, 2]
filter = np.ones([1, 3, 2, 3])
out_backprop = np.ones([3, 1, 0, 3])
strides = [1, 1, 2, 1]
padding = 'VALID'

tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput(
   input_sizes = input_sizes,
   filter = filter,
   out_backprop = out_backprop,
   strides = strides,
   padding = padding
)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [27a65a43cf763897fecfa5cdb5cc653fc5dd0346](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/27a65a43cf763897fecfa5cdb5cc653fc5dd0346).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
