Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-35999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Conv2DBackpropInput` operation within TensorFlow. When this operation receives an empty `out_backprop` input tensor (i.e., a tensor with at least one dimension of size 0, like `[3, 1, 0, 1]`), the CPU/GPU kernels fail due to a `CHECK` failure in the underlying libraries (dnnl and cudnn).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The core weakness is that the `Conv2DBackpropInput` operation did not properly handle the case of an empty `out_backprop` input tensor. It didn't have a safe handling path, and the underlying libraries used for computation failed with a CHECK failure, causing the program to crash.
- **Denial of Service:** The `CHECK` failure when an empty tensor is provided leads to a crash, enabling a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting a specific input (`out_backprop`) for `Conv2DBackpropInput` with at least one dimension being zero, which results in a crash of the TensorFlow process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through manipulating the input tensor `out_backprop` to have at least one dimension with a size of zero.
- **API Call:**  The attacker would trigger this by calling the vulnerable function with the malicious input, as shown in the example code:
   ```python
    tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput(
       input_sizes = input_sizes,
       filter = filter,
       out_backprop = out_backprop,
       strides = strides,
       padding = padding
    )
   ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Inputs:** An attacker would need to be able to control the input tensors passed to the `tf.raw_ops.Conv2DBackpropInput` operation. This could be achieved in various ways, such as:
   -  By manipulating data fed into a TensorFlow model
   - If the model itself is user-defined, an attacker could create a model that triggers this vulnerability with crafted inputs.

**Additional details from the commit:**
The provided commit information clarifies the fix. It adds a shortcut path within the `Conv2DBackpropInputOp` and `Conv2DCustomBackpropInputOp` to return a zero input tensor when `out_backprop` is empty. This prevents the vulnerable code paths in dnnl and cudnn from being triggered and thus avoids the crash.

The fix involves the following steps:
1. Checking if `out_backprop.NumElements() == 0`
2. If true, setting the `in_backprop` tensor to all zeros using a `functor::SetZeroFunctor`
3. Return.

This commit also includes a new test case to verify that this specific scenario is handled correctly:
`testConv2DBackpropInputDegenerateBackpropInput`

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a crash due to a lack of proper input validation in `Conv2DBackpropInput` when receiving an empty output backprop tensor. An attacker can exploit this by crafting specific input tensors to cause a denial of service. The fix introduces a shortcut path to properly handle zero-sized tensors.
