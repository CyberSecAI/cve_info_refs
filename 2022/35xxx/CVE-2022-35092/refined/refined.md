The provided content is related to multiple vulnerabilities found in `swftools-pdf2swf`, not just CVE-2022-35092. It includes details of heap buffer overflows, stack buffer overflows, global buffer overflows, segmentation faults (SEGV), floating point exceptions (FPE), and out-of-memory errors. These issues were identified using fuzzing techniques.

Here's a breakdown of the different vulnerabilities:

**1. Heap Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple heap buffer overflows occur in different parts of the code when processing a crafted PDF file.
    *   `DCTStream::readHuffSym` (Stream.cc:2825)
    *   `GfxICCBasedColorSpace::getDefaultColor` (GfxState.cc:923)
    *   `draw_stroke` (stroke.c:212)
    *   `DCTStream::reset` (Stream.cc:1994)
*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write or read on the heap due to improper handling of data when parsing the PDF file.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.

**2. Stack Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Stack buffer overflow due to improper bounds checking when processing image data.
    *   `ImageStream::getPixel` (Stream.cc:348)
*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds write on the stack.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.

**3. Global Buffer Overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** Global buffer overflow in `DCTStream::transformDataUnit` (Stream.cc:2804).
*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read/write on global memory.
*   **Impact:** Application crash.
*  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.

**4. Segmentation Faults (SEGV)**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple SEGV crashes occur during PDF processing in various parts of the code. These are likely due to null pointer dereferences or memory corruption.
    *   `FoFiTrueType::writeTTF` (FoFiTrueType.cc:910 & 1146)
    *   `convert_gfxline` (convert.c:31)
    *   `gfxline_getbbox` (gfxtools.c:765)
    *   `memset`
    *  `InfoOutputDev::type3D1` (InfoOutputDev.cc:887)
     *   `FoFiTrueType::computeTableChecksum` (FoFiTrueType.cc:1776)
*   **Vulnerability:** Access to invalid memory locations.
*  **Impact:** Application crash.
*  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.

**5. Floating Point Exception (FPE)**

*   **Root Cause:** Division by zero or other invalid arithmetic operation during PDF processing in `DCTStream::readMCURow` (Stream.cc:2123).
*   **Vulnerability:** Invalid arithmetic operation resulting in a signal.
*   **Impact:** Application crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted PDF file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.

**6. Out-of-Memory**

*  **Root Cause**: Attempt to allocate extremely large memory chunk in `draw_stroke` (stroke.c:192), leading to an out of memory error.
*  **Vulnerability:** Excessive memory allocation leading to a crash.
*  **Impact**: Application crash.
*  **Attack Vector**: Maliciously crafted PDF file.
*  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.
