The servlet spec allows for what are called "Matrix Parameters" which are URI parameters that are separated by semicolons - which means that a uri can have semicolons in it that can be used to avoid path based rules and filters.

# MatrixParameter Security Interceptor

This plugin adds a web interceptor that prevents dotCMS from accepting "matrix" parameters in uris. A matrix parameter is a non-standard parameter list that is started with a semi-colon. Java app servers like tomcat and old school j2ee applications used to use matrix parameters to encode the JSESSIONID on the end of a url, e.g. urls like:

`https://oldapplication.com/index.jsp;JSESSIONID=AAABBB4532154`

The issue is that by allowing matrix parameters allows for security filters based on URIs to be bypassed, in this example the dotCMS XSS prevention filter.

In an abundance of caution, this Interceptor also disallows other non-standard URI characters that are commonly used in attacks. Below is a list of characters that are explictly disallowed.

```
            ";",
            "..",
            "//",
            "/./",
            "\\",
            "?",
            "%3B", // encoded semi-colon
            "%2E", // encoded period '.'
            "%2F", // encoded forward slash '/'
            "%5C", // encoded back slash '\'
            "%3F", // encoded questionmark
            "%3D", // encoded equals
            "%00", // encoded null
            "\0",  // null
            "\r",  // carriage return
            "\n",  // line feed
            "\f"   // form feed
```

With this interceptor installed, if any of the above characters are found in the request URI, dotCMS will return a 404 response.

## How to install this plugin

The jar files can be downloaded directly and added to your dotCMS instance. You can find the binary here. This version works on dotCMS versions 5.1.6 and greater.
<https://github.com/dotCMS/patches-hotfixes/blob/master/com.dotcms.security.matrixparams/build/libs/>

The sha256 values for the hotfix file is:

| File | sha256 |
| --- | --- |
| com.dotcms.security.matrixparams-0.1.jar | bd29545bd40ab7ee9efaaa30c3f4ba96bfdd7d05aef8c635979305635aad66db |

## How to build the plugin

To build the OSGI jars run
`./gradlew clean jar`

This will build a jar in the `build/libs` directory.

* **To install this plugin:**
  Upload the bundle jars files using the dotCMS UI (*CMS Admin->Dynamic Plugins->Upload Plugin*).
* **To uninstall this plugin:**

Undeploy the bundle jars using the dotCMS UI (*CMS Admin->Dynamic Plugins->Undeploy*).

### [Issues](/security/known-issues.dot) » Matrix URI parameters can expose private assets

| Issue: | SI-63 |
| --- | --- |
| Date: | Jun 14, 2022, 1:45:00 PM |
| Severity: | Medium |
| Requires Admin Access: | No |
| Fix Version: | 22.06, 22.03.2, 21.06.9, 5.3.8.12 |
| Credit: | Fortinet (<https://www.fortinet.com/>) |
| Description: | Some Java Application frameworks, including those used by Spring or Tomcat, allow the use of [“matrix parameters”](https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html) — URI parameters separated by semicolons. Through precise semicolon placement in a URI, it is possible to exploit this feature to avoid dotCMS's path-based XSS prevention/require login filters and access restricted resources.  For example, the semicolon in the URL below would reveal to anyone a text file ordinarily only visible to signed-in users:`https://demo.dotcms.com/html;/js/dojo/README-Building-dojo-for-dotCMS.txt`  The ability to circumvent these filters can be chained with other code to expolit dotCMS using XSS attacks. |
| Mitigation: | Upgrade dotCMS recommends upgrading to one of the versions of dotCMS patched against this vulnerability, which include the following, as well as subsequent versions:  * **Agile:**  + 22.06+  * **LTS:**  + 22.03.2+ + 21.06.9+ + 5.3.8.12+ WAF Rule It is possible to create a WAF rule that disallows **;** (semi-colons) specifically in the the URI portion of a request URL. This would effectivily block any exploit of the vunerability. Hotfix PlugindotCMS 5.1.6+ The following OSGi plugin, designed to work with versions dotCMS 5.1.6 and later, can be used to mitigate the issue in running dotCMS instances:  * [https://github.com/dotCMS/patches-hotfixes/tree/master/com.dotcms.security.matrixparams](https://github.com/dotCMS/patches-hotfixes/tree/master/com.dotcms.security.matrixparams#how-to-install-this-plugin) dotCMS Cloud dotCMS has already applied mitigations for this issue to all dotCMS Cloud customers; no action is needed. |
