Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `QuantizedAvgPool` and `QuantizedMaxPool` operations in TensorFlow not properly validating the rank of the `min_input` and `max_input` tensors. These tensors are expected to be scalars (rank 0), but the code did not enforce this restriction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Rank Validation:** The code failed to check if the `min_input` and `max_input` tensors were rank 0, leading to a potential use of tensors with incorrect shapes.
- **Type Confusion:** The vulnerability involves the incorrect handling of tensor shapes and the potential of causing type confusion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Providing `min_input` or `max_input` tensors with a nonzero rank to the `QuantizedAvgPool` or `QuantizedMaxPool` operations can cause a segmentation fault (segfault), leading to a crash of the TensorFlow process and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow graph with a `QuantizedAvgPool` or `QuantizedMaxPool` operation that uses `min_input` and `max_input` tensors with invalid ranks (non-zero).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide input to TensorFlow:** The attacker must be able to supply a malicious graph with invalid parameters to the vulnerable operations in TensorFlow to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0, and is fixed in versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The fix involves adding checks to ensure that `min_input` and `max_input` tensors are indeed scalars (rank 0).
- The vulnerability was reported by Neophytos Christou of Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.
- The provided code snippet demonstrates the vulnerability in `QuantizedAvgPool`. The same applies to `QuantizedMaxPool`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- The commit 7cdf9d4d2083b739ec81cfdace546b0c99f50622 on GitHub contains the fix.
- The original code used `flat<float>()(0)` to access scalar values, which could lead to out-of-bounds read if the tensor was not a scalar and had no elements. This was replaced with the use of `scalar<float>()()` to get the single scalar value from the tensor and the addition of checks using `TensorShapeUtils::IsScalar` and `min_input_tensor.NumElements() == 1` to ensure the tensor is scalar.
- The fix also updated the error message to be consistent with the shape function.
- Tests are also added to ensure invalid inputs raise proper errors in python (`quantization_ops_test.py`).
