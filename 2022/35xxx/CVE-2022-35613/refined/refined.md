- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Konker Platform disables CSRF protection by using `http.csrf().disable()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially perform actions on the platform on behalf of a legitimate user without their consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious web page or link that, when visited by a logged-in user, sends a forged request to the vulnerable platform.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user of the Konker Platform into visiting a malicious webpage or link.
