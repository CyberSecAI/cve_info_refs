```
If the filter size exceeds the input size by one for `VALID` padding,
return an empty tensor. This is consistent with XLA.

# `CHECK` fail in `MaxPool`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-j43h-pgmg-5hjq
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

When `MaxPool` receives a window size input array `ksize` with dimensions greater than its input tensor `input`, the GPU kernel gives a `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

input = np.ones([1, 1, 1, 1])
ksize = [1, 1, 2, 2]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = 'VALID'
data_format = 'NCHW'

tf.raw_ops.MaxPool(input=input, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding, data_format=data_format)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/32d7bd3defd134f21a4e344c8dfd40099aaf6b18).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
