Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35612:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization and output encoding within the MQTTRoute application. Specifically, the application allows users to input arbitrary JavaScript code into the dashboard name text field. This input is then stored and displayed without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it in the application's interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code in the context of a user's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The provided example shows an attacker stealing admin session cookies. With stolen cookies, an attacker could impersonate an admin and perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted Payload:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the dashboard name field.
*   **Form Submission:** The attacker submits the crafted payload through a form field.
*   **User Interaction:** When other users view the dashboard, the malicious JavaScript will execute in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to the Application:** The attacker needs to have access to the MQTTRoute application and the ability to input data in the "dashboard name" field.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to know how to craft XSS payloads.
