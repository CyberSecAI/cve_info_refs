- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM Jazz for Service Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to the hijacking of authenticated user sessions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the stored XSS vulnerability in the application which means an attacker would inject malicious scripts that get stored in the system and then executed when other users view the affected area.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to inject malicious scripts into the system. An authenticated user might be needed, but that is not clear from the provided information.
