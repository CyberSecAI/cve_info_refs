  try {
      break
      try {
        return } catch (a) {}
    } catch (b) {}
}())
```

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

```
Previously, JUMP offset for a break instruction inside a try-catch
block was not set to a correct offset during code generation
when a return instruction was present in inner try-catch block.

The fix is to update the JUMP offset appropriately.

This closes [#553](https://github.com/nginx/njs/issues/553) issue on Github.
