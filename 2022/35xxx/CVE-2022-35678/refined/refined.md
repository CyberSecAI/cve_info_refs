The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35678.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak. The attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information by reading data from unintended memory locations.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system. It also requires user interaction (UI:R), meaning that the user has to perform an action (e.g., open a malicious PDF file).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access and the ability to convince a user to open a specially crafted file.
