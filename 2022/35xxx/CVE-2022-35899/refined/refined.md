Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-35899

**Root Cause:** The root cause of this vulnerability is an **unquoted service path** in the "GameSDK Service" provided by ASUS. The service's executable path, "C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS\GameSDK Service\GameSDK.exe", contains spaces, but is not enclosed in quotes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Unquoted Service Path:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of quotes around the service's executable path, allowing for a potential path hijacking.
* **Writable Directory:** The vulnerability requires the attacker to have write privileges to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS" directory or "C:\".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Privilege Escalation:** By placing a malicious executable named "Program.exe" or "GameSDK.exe" in a parent directory within the unquoted path, an attacker can achieve privilege escalation. When the service starts, the system will execute the malicious file instead of the intended application with LocalSystem privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to write to "C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS" directory or "C:".
* **File Replacement:** The attack involves replacing the legitimate service executable or creating a malicious executable with a misleading name in a higher folder in the path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Compromised System:** The attacker must have already compromised the system and have the required write privileges.
* **Write Privileges:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS" or "C:\" directory.

**Technical Details:**
* The vulnerable service is "GameSDK Service" with the executable path "C:\Program Files (x86)\ASUS\GameSDK Service\GameSDK.exe".
* The service starts automatically with LocalSystem privileges, making it a prime target for privilege escalation.
* The provided `wmic` command helps identify the vulnerable service.
* A `sc qc` command result also shows service details, and confirm the vulnerable path
* The vulnerability was tested on Windows 10.
* Patched version is 1.0.5.0, while the vulnerable version is 1.0.0.4
