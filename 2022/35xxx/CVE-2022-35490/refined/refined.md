Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Zammad's brute-force attack prevention mechanism. This mechanism is designed to invalidate users and prevent logins after a certain number of failed login attempts. The attacker can bypass this mechanism, allowing them to send more login requests than intended before the user gets locked out.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core weakness is the ability to circumvent the brute-force protection. This means that an attacker can make more login attempts than intended before triggering the user invalidation, effectively allowing them to attempt more password guesses in a given timeframe.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The impact is that an attacker can potentially brute-force login credentials. By bypassing the invalidation mechanism, they gain additional attempts to guess passwords, increasing the likelihood of a successful breach. This could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the data within.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves sending more login requests than the system is configured to allow before invalidating a user account for excessive failed login attempts. The attacker sends these requests using the standard login form.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send login requests to the Zammad system. No specific position is mentioned, so this could be done remotely if the system is accessible. They also need knowledge of a valid username for the system.
