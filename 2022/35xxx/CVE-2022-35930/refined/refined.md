Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35930:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `ValidatePolicyAttestationsForAuthority` function within the `policy-controller`'s webhook validator. Specifically, the logic for handling attestation verification was flawed. When a policy specified a particular attestation type (e.g., "spdx") and an image had at least one valid signature but *no* attestations of the specified type, the function would incorrectly return a positive result, bypassing the intended verification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypass of attestation verification:** The core weakness is that the policy controller failed to enforce the attestation type as configured in the policy. It would incorrectly consider an image valid if it had at least one signature, even if the required attestation types were missing.
- **Logic error in attestation filtering:** The code incorrectly assumed that if any attestation was present with a valid signature, the validation was successful, instead of ensuring the presence of a matching attestation of the specific type defined in the policy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **False Positive Admission:** A malicious or non-compliant image could bypass the policy controller and be admitted into a Kubernetes cluster, even though it lacked the required attestations.
- **Compromised Supply Chain Security:** This bypass could lead to the deployment of vulnerable or tampered images, undermining the intended security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a container image that has a valid signature but omits specific attestation types that a policy requires (e.g., not including SPDX attestation while having a generic signature).
- The attacker needs to deploy this image into the cluster managed by the vulnerable policy-controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to deploy container images into a Kubernetes cluster where the vulnerable `policy-controller` is running. This could mean:
    - The attacker has access to the cluster's API and can create pods or deployments
    - The attacker is able to inject images into the CI/CD pipeline.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when there are no attestations of the type being verified, but at least one attestation is present with valid signature.
- The vulnerability is described in the GitHub Security Advisory [GHSA-739f-hw6h-7wq8](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-739f-hw6h-7wq8).
- The fix for this vulnerability is included in version `0.2.1` of `policy-controller`.
- The vulnerability was discovered by `@mattmoor`.
- A sample image and `ClusterImagePolicy` are provided in the advisory to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The fix involves correctly filtering the attestations based on the desired type, and returning an error if a matching attestation is not found.
