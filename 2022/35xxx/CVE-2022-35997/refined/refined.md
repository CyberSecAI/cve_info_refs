Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35997:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `tf.sparse.cross` function within TensorFlow. The function's implementation did not properly validate the `separator` input, which should be a scalar value (a single string). When a non-scalar value (e.g., a tensor of multiple strings) was provided as the separator, it triggered a `CHECK` failure in the underlying C++ code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The primary weakness was the absence of proper input validation for the `separator` argument in `tf.sparse.cross`.
*   **`CHECK` Failure:** The lack of validation led to a `CHECK` failure. In TensorFlow, `CHECK` failures generally lead to program termination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a non-scalar separator to `tf.sparse.cross`, an attacker could cause a `CHECK` failure, leading to program termination, effectively resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Function Call:** The attack vector is through a direct call to the `tf.sparse.cross` function with a crafted non-scalar separator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control input to `tf.sparse.cross`:** An attacker needs to be able to control the `separator` parameter when calling the `tf.sparse.cross` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was patched by adding a check for scalar values for the `separator` input within the `SparseCrossV2Op` class in `tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_cross_op.cc`.
*   A corresponding test case was added to `tensorflow/python/kernel_tests/sparse_ops/sparse_cross_op_test.py` to ensure the fix prevents the issue in the future.
