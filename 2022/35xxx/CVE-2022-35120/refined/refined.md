Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The core issue stems from **incorrect access control and insecure storage of sensitive information** within the IXPdata EasyInstall client software. Specifically, the administrative tool ("IXPADM64.exe") caches encrypted login credentials that can be decrypted locally due to a weak encryption implementation using the same key to encrypt/decrypt the information.
*   The client software stores a configuration folder at `c:\ixp\data` which is hidden from Windows Explorer, but still accessible with normal permissions, and contains sensitive information such as server IPs and hostnames.
*   Lack of permission controls on critical files and directories including the BIN folder, allowing users to copy administrative tools.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The administrative tool caches encrypted login credentials that can be decrypted locally.
*   **Weak Encryption:** Using the same key for encryption and decryption makes it trivial to extract the credentials.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:**
    *   The configuration folder `c:\ixp\data` has weak file system permissions, allowing local users to modify configuration files.
    *   Sensitive information including server IPs and hostnames, are stored in plaintext within the configuration folder logs.
    *   BIN directory has no access controls allowing users to steal administrative tools.
*   **Misconfiguration Detection Failure:** Initially, the software did not detect or alert on misconfigurations of the user account.
*   **Failure to Restrict Command Execution:** The software tried to block `cmd.exe`, but failed to block Powershell, which can be used to run `cmd.exe`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** The ability to decrypt cached credentials can be used to gain higher privileges on the local machine.
*   **Lateral Movement:** The discovered credentials could be used to gain access to other systems on the network.
*   **Server Compromise:**  If the "User-EasyInstall" account is misconfigured with too many privileges, the attacker could gain administrative rights on the server and consequently to all connected clients.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive information like hostnames, IPs, and other server details can be exposed.
*  **Sabotage:** Changing configuration files can block software updates.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to a machine running the vulnerable IXPdata EasyInstall client software.
*   **File System Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to browse the file system to gain access to the config folder (c:\ixp\data), which can be done by using powershell.
*   **Registry Access:** Accessing the registry key (`HKLM\SOFTWARE\IXP\Agent\ClientID`) is required to access the client ID.
*   **Application Exploitation:** The attacker uses the administrative tool ("IXPADM64.exe") to reveal the cached decrypted credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a regular user account on a machine running the vulnerable software.
*   **Basic Technical Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to navigate the file system, run commands, and use the application's interface.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description by detailing the exact location of vulnerable files and configuration settings, as well as the specific actions required to exploit the vulnerabilities, such as running Powershell or using the "Try to connect using Anywhere" feature.
*   The provided information includes the vendor's fixes, which are: making the local config file no longer user-writable, implementing checks for account permission misconfigurations, and encrypting usernames and passwords with different keys.
