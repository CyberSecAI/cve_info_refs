# Zulip Server 5.6 security release

  [![](/_astro/greg-price.BEialEM6_Z1bVkjS.webp)](author/greg-price/)  [Greg Price](author/greg-price/)   Aug 24, 2022 • 2 min read

We released Zulip Server 5.6 today! This is a security release, containing an
important security fix and several cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.5.

## Upgrading

We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release)
in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available
on [chat.zulip.org](https://zulip.com/development-community/).

## Notable changes

* Fixed an issue where an attacker who can send messages could trick the server
  into embedding a link that violates Zulip’s security model.
  + This fixes a security vulnerability (CVE-2022-36048): When displaying
    messages with embedded remote images, Zulip normally loads the image preview
    via a go-camo proxy server. However, an attacker who can send messages could
    include a crafted URL that tricks the server into embedding a remote image
    reference directly. This could allow the attacker to infer the viewer’s IP
    address and browser fingerprinting information.
  + This fix also protects against a vulnerability in the Zulip mobile app
    (CVE-2022-35962), discussed in detail below.
* Added hardening against timing attacks to an internal authentication check.
* Improved documentation for hosting multiple organizations on a server.
* Updated dependencies.
* Updated translations.

CVE-2022-36048 was discovered internally by the Zulip team.

## Zulip Mobile v27.190 security release

Users of the Zulip mobile apps should upgrade to v27.190, which was released
simultaneously with this Zulip Server release. This mobile release fixes a
security issue:

* CVE-2022-35962: An attacker who can send messages could craft a malformed
  image link which, if tapped in the Zulip mobile apps, could disclose the
  recipient’s Zulip credentials.

CVE-2022-35962 was discovered internally by the Zulip team. We have performed a
complete audit, and determined that this vulnerability has never been exploited
in Zulip Cloud. The vulnerability is present in all previous mobile releases.

As discussed above, upgrading to Zulip Server 5.6 also protects against
CVE-2022-35962, even for users running older versions of Zulip Mobile. Zulip
Cloud has also been upgraded to protect against this vulnerability.

## Community

We love feedback from the Zulip user community. Here are a few ways you can
connect:

  feedback directly to the development community!

### Highlights for users

* Fixed an issue where a crafted, malformed image link in a message sent by an authenticated user could lead to credential disclosure if a user taps on the image to expand it. (CVE-2022-35962)

This issue was discovered internally by the Zulip developers. We

analyzed all message history on Zulip Cloud and determined it has

never been exploited there.

Zulip server administrators should also upgrade to Zulip Server 5.6 or

later, to make this issue impossible to exploit on their servers.

# Crafted link in Zulip message can cause disclosure of credentials

High

[gnprice](/gnprice)
published
GHSA-4gj2-j32x-4wg5
Aug 24, 2022

## Package

Zulip Mobile
(mobile app)

## Affected versions

up to v27.189

## Patched versions

v27.190

## Description

### Impact

In Zulip Mobile versions up through v27.189, a crafted, malformed image link in a message sent by an authenticated user could lead to credential disclosure for a user who taps the image link.

This issue was discovered internally by the Zulip team. A complete audit on Zulip Cloud determined the vulnerability has never been exploited there.

### Patches

This vulnerability is fixed in Zulip Mobile version v27.190.

### Workarounds

Upgrading the Zulip server to Zulip Server 5.6 or later will prevent sending malformed links, making it impossible for this issue to be exploited. Zulip Cloud has been similarly upgraded.

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
