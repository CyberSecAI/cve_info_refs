Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-35962:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a malformed image link within a Zulip message. The Zulip mobile app does not properly handle these crafted links, leading to potential credential disclosure when the user taps on the image to expand it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The Zulip mobile app fails to sanitize or validate image links, allowing an attacker to inject malicious URLs.
*   **Credential Disclosure:** Tapping on the malformed link can expose the user's Zulip credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of the victim's Zulip credentials.
*   **Account Compromise:** An attacker who obtains a user's credentials can compromise the victim's Zulip account, potentially accessing sensitive information, sending unauthorized messages, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, since the attacker only needs the ability to send messages to the victim.
*   **Malicious Message:** The attacker crafts a message containing a malformed image link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Zulip system to send messages.
*   **Ability to Send Messages:** The attacker needs the capability to send messages to the intended victim user.
*   **No special server access:** This vulnerability exists on the client side (mobile application).

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Zulip Mobile versions up to v27.189 and is fixed in v27.190.
*   Upgrading the Zulip server to version 5.6 or later will prevent sending malformed links, which serves as a workaround, even if users are running older versions of the mobile app.
*  The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 8.0, with metrics indicating a low attack complexity, network attack vector, a required user interaction, high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact, along with a low level of privileges required by the attacker.
*  The identified CWEs include: CWE-184 (Improper Data Storage) and CWE-436 (Unchecked Input).
