- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses an insecure deserialization process, allowing it to deserialize any type of object.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands without privilege by sending malicious serialized objects.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending maliciously crafted serialized objects to the vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the vulnerable function.
