- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the `authenticateAdSso` method due to the lack of authentication checks before allowing the execution of python code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for a critical function that leads to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, a lack of authentication before allowing python code execution via the `authenticateAdSso` method.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM on the affected Inductive Automation Ignition installation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote, over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service. No prior authentication is required.
