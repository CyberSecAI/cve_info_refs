    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content details a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `undici` library where user-controlled input in the `path/pathname` option of `undici.request` can lead to requests being sent to unexpected hosts.",
     "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how `undici.request` processes the `path/pathname` option. When a user provides an absolute URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1` or `//127.0.0.1`) in this option, instead of treating it as part of the path, the library incorrectly interprets it as the full URL, leading to requests being sent to the attacker-controlled host.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
           "Improper input validation",
          "Incorrect URL parsing"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks. This allows them to make requests to internal services or other servers from the context of the vulnerable application. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, internal network reconnaissance, or other malicious activities.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the `path/pathname` option of the `undici.request` function. An attacker can inject a malicious absolute URL into this option. This could be achieved by manipulating user input or data sources used by the application.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control or influence the `path` or `pathname` parameters provided to the `undici.request` function. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access within the system."
