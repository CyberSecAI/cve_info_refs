Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `hidden_id` parameter in the `blotter.php` file. The application directly incorporates this parameter into an SQL query without adequate escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `hidden_id` parameter in `blotter.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data Breach: Attackers can use the SQL injection vulnerability to access sensitive database information, including database names, table structures, and data stored in the tables.
- Data Manipulation: It's possible for an attacker to modify or delete database records.
- Unauthorized Access: An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access or elevate privileges by manipulating the database.
- Denial of Service: If the database becomes compromised, it may lead to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/bmis/pages/blotter/blotter.php`
- The `hidden_id` POST parameter is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.
- The attacker can be unauthenticated, as no authentication is needed to send the malicious `hidden_id` parameter in a POST request.
- The attacker needs to have a basic knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious SQL query within the `hidden_id` parameter.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content gives a specific payload that exploits the vulnerability, which uses `updatexml` to extract the database name:  `hidden_id=1' and updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select database()),0x7e),0)--+`
- The exploit method used in this case was an error-based SQL injection.
- The page vulnerable to SQL injection is `/bmis/pages/blotter/blotter.php`
