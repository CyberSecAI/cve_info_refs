Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-35554

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when handling error messages, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The application reflects attacker-controlled input in the response without proper sanitization.
*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize user inputs, specifically within the error message handling mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Client-Side Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Potential for Data Theft:** The attacker can potentially access cookies, session tokens, and other sensitive data within the victim's browser context.
*   **Account Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially perform actions on behalf of the victim or compromise the victim's account.
*   **Phishing:** The attacker can redirect the victim to a malicious website or manipulate the content of the page for phishing purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code in specific parameters and sends it to the victim.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker may use social engineering techniques to lure the victim into clicking on the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with the specific vulnerable parameters.
*   **Ability to Deliver the Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted URL to a victim, often through social engineering or other means.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability is triggered by injecting malicious JavaScript code into the following parameters of URLs:
   *   `https://[URL]/svcl/pages/monitoring/printingController.xhtml`: `mainform:activeProcesses`
   *   `/svcl/pages/monitoring/monitoring.xhtml`: `mainform:processTabPanel_activeIndex`
   *   `/svcl/pages/services/formatter/mainconfiguration.xhtml`: `mainform:mainTable_selection`

The provided exploit URL demonstrates the injection of a `<x:script>` tag with an alert function into the `mainform:activeProcesses` parameter.

The `javax.faces.ViewState` parameter in the first URL can be modified as long as its length is the same as the original. However, this is not possible for the other two URLs.

The vulnerable version is SmartVista Cardgen version 3.28.0 and prior.
