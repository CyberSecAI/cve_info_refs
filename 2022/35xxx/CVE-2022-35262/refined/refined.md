The provided content relates to CVE-2022-35262.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `hashFirst` function of the GoAhead web server library (version 4.0.0) used by Robustel R1510 routers. Specifically, the `hashFirst` function receives a `WebsHash` value, which is an index into a hash table array. The code contains an assertion to check if this index is within a valid range. However, the assertion is effectively disabled, so an invalid index, such as -1, can be passed to the array access at `sym[sd]`, resulting in an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the `hashFirst` function due to improper input validation.
- Ineffective assertion mechanism that doesn't prevent the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Exploitation leads to a segmentation fault and termination of the web server process, rendering the device's web interface and functionality unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/action/import_xml_file/` API without including any files. This results in `webs->files` being -1, which is then passed to `hashFirst` as a `WebsHash` value causing an out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server of the Robustel R1510 router.
- The attacker does not require any credentials or to be authenticated.
