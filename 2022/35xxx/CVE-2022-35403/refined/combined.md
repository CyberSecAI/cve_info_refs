# Security advisory

## Local file disclosure vulnerability

**CVE ID: CVE-2022-35403**

| Product Name | Severity | Affected Version(s) | Fixed Version | Fixed On |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ServiceDesk Plus | High | 13007 and below | 13008 | July 7, 2022 |
| ServiceDesk Plus MSP | High | 10605 and below | 10606 | July 11, 2022 |

| AssetExplorer | Medium | 6976 and below | 6977 | July 7, 2022 |

**Details**

This file disclosure vulnerability allows non-login users to download local files from the ServiceDesk Plus, ServiceDesk Plus MSP and SupportCenter Plus server machines by sending a crafted email for ticket creation. The same vulnerability
affects AssetExplorer too which falls under medium severity since it needs authentication to exploit.

We fixed this issue by adding additional checks to process the email content to avoid the local file disclosure vulnerability in ServiceDesk Plus, ServiceDesk Plus MSP, SupportCenter Plus and AssetExplorer.

**Impact**

This vulnerability allows non-login users to download local files from the server machine.
