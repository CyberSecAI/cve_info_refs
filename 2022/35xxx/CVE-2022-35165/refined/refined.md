```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `AP4_SgpdAtom::AP4_SgpdAtom` function where a large value for `entry_count` can be provided in the input, leading to excessive memory allocation within a loop.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled loop based on a user-supplied value (`entry_count`), leading to a memory exhaustion vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A crafted input file can cause a denial-of-service by exhausting the available memory, leading to process termination.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted MP4 file using the `mp42aac` tool.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable application (`mp42aac`)."
