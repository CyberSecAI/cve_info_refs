- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to improper parsing of maliciously crafted OBJ files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a maliciously crafted OBJ file using an affected version of MicroStation or a MicroStation-based application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious OBJ file to be opened by a user using an affected application. This implies user interaction is required.
