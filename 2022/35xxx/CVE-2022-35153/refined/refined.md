The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35153.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input when constructing command-line arguments in `fax_to_email.php` and `fax_send.php` files. Specifically, the code was not using `escapeshellarg()` on variables that were later used in shell commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the possibility of command injection, due to the lack of sanitization of input variables used in shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: An attacker could inject malicious commands into the variables used in shell commands in `fax_to_email.php` and `fax_send.php`, leading to arbitrary command execution on the server. This could result in a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Manipulation of fax parameters: Attackers could manipulate parameters related to fax processing, such as caller ID name, fax file name, or email addresses, to inject malicious code into the shell commands executed by the system.
- Specifically, in the `fax_to_email.php` file, the parameters `fax_forward_number`, `domain_name`, `fax_accountcode`, `fax_caller_id_name`, `fax_caller_id_number`, `fax_file`, `mail_to_address`, and `mail_from_address` were not escaped. Similarly, in `fax_send.php`, the parameters `fax_name`, `fax_file_extension`, `fax_accountcode`, `fax_caller_id_name`, `fax_caller_id_number`, `fax_file`, `mail_to_address`, and `mail_from_address` and variables from `$_SESSION['fax']['variable']` were vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send/manipulate fax parameters: An attacker needs to have the ability to send or manipulate the parameters associated with fax processing to inject their malicious code. The specific mechanism through which this can be achieved isn't detailed in the provided content, but it indicates a path to inject parameters used within the command construction in the mentioned files.
