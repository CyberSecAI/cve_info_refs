- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Hulu / ãã¼ã«ã¼" App for Android used a hard-coded API key for an external service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application had a hard-coded API key (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The hard-coded API key could be retrieved by reverse-engineering the application binary. The impact is limited to the confidentiality of the API key. The application users are not directly affected.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring access to the application binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to reverse engineer the application's binary to extract the hard-coded API key.
