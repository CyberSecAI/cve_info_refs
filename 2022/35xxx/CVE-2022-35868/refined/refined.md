Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35868:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an untrusted search path in the TIA Project-Server (formerly known as TIA Multiuser Server). The application may load libraries or executables from attacker-controlled locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path:** The software does not properly validate the paths used to load external resources, allowing an attacker to control these paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** By manipulating the search path, an attacker can trick a legitimate user into starting the service from an attacker-controlled path. This can lead to the execution of malicious code with elevated privileges, granting the attacker greater control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to control the path from which the TIA Project-Server or TIA Multiuser Server is started. This means the attacker must have write access to the directory or be able to manipulate the process that launches the service to use a malicious working directory.
- The attacker then needs to trick the legitimate user to start the service from this attacker-controlled path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the TIA Project-Server is installed.
- **Low Privileges (PR:L):** The attacker can have low privileges on the system.
- **User Interaction (UI:R):** The attacker must trick a user to launch the service from an attacker-controlled path.
- **Exploit Code Maturity (E:P):** Proof of concept exploit code exists

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- TIA Multiuser Server V14: All versions
- TIA Multiuser Server V15: All versions < V15.1 Update 8
- TIA Project-Server: All versions < V1.1
- TIA Project-Server V16: All versions
- TIA Project-Server V17: All versions < V17 Update 6

**Mitigations:**
- The primary mitigation is to ensure the working directory from which the TIA server is started does not contain untrusted files.
- Siemens recommends updating to the latest versions of affected products.
- For products where updates are not available or planned, migrating to TIA Project-Server V1.1 or later is recommended.
