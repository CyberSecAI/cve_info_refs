Passing in too many dimensions causes an assertion
failure and a crash. Check input as a precondition and
fail gracefully.

# `CHECK` failure in tf.reshape via overflows

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-f4w6-h4f5-wx45
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of tf.reshape op in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by overflowing the number of elements in a tensor:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.reshape(tensor=[[1]],shape=tf.constant([0 for i in range(255)], dtype=tf.int64))
```

This is another instance of [TFSA-2021-198](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/security/advisory/tfsa-2021-198.md) ([GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p "GHSA-prcg-wp5q-rv7p")).

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Kang Hong Jin from Singapore Management University.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-35934

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
