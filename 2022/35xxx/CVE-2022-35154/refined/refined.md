Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `goods_ids` parameter of the `/addons/shopro/goods/lists` endpoint within the Shopro Mall system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Error-Based SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection. Specifically, the vulnerability is error-based, meaning the attacker leverages error messages to extract information from the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive information from the database. This includes database names, administrator passwords, and potentially other sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/addons/shopro/goods/lists` endpoint. The attacker modifies the `goods_ids` parameter to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable `/addons/shopro/goods/lists` endpoint and the vulnerable `goods_ids` parameter.
*   **Basic understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax to construct malicious SQL queries within the injected parameter.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects SQL code into the `goods_ids` parameter using techniques such as `updatexml` and `concat` to trigger SQL errors and extract data.
*   The provided PoC (Proof of Concept) code demonstrates how to send a crafted request to trigger the vulnerability and check for a 500 status code containing "XPATH" in the response which indicates successful exploitation
*   The vulnerability is specifically confirmed on version V1.3.8 of Shopro Mall system.
