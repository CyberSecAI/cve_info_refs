- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Prior to version 21.0.3, IBM Robotic Process Automation allowed weak passwords, making it easier for attackers to compromise accounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of weak passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers could compromise user accounts due to the use of weak passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers could attempt to gain access to accounts by using common or easily guessable passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the capability to try to log in to an account and must have access to the login interface.
