| I think will be good to implement behat tests to check if it is working fine.  It is intentionally disables even for the login and stuff: <https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/blob/master/tests/integration/run.sh#L69-L70> So not sure that is possible. Similarly we can't really test the password policy feature in [#7473](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7473) as the used passwords violate the rules. |

If I am not mistaken there are some other endpoints that need to be protected:

* [`getRoomByFileId`](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/blob/c07251f0c67d3c02debe1f6dbe0e12ee3fe9f99a/lib/Controller/FilesIntegrationController.php#L115) and [`getRoomByShareToken`](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/blob/c07251f0c67d3c02debe1f6dbe0e12ee3fe9f99a/lib/Controller/FilesIntegrationController.php#L181) in FilesIntegrationController, to protect the file id or share token of a public share
* [`getSettings`](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/blob/1d0d80e22eaa75080edeba9612a8e21194271545/lib/Controller/SignalingController.php#L116) in SignalingController, to protect the conversation token

First thing that is done is checking if you have access to the fileId. That is outside of the scope of Talk and only gives you tokens which you can access.  Other things are fixed |

First thing that is done is checking if you have access to the fileId. That is outside of the scope of Talk and only gives you tokens which you can access.  I thought that public shared files were seen as being accessible by the user when checked with the file id, but the code says that they are not. I think that I mixed up the tests for the shared token and the file id, sorry for the noise. |

Tested and (mostly, see comments) works üëç

What about [resetting the delay for the signaling server IP when the secret is changed](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7504#discussion_r912429223)? In my experience it is not uncommon to set a wrong secret, and if it is not reset and no hint is given about the throttling I would expect some puzzled admins :-)

Besides that, similarly to `getParticipantByDialInPin` and `createGuestByDialIn`, `getSingleRoom` needs to be protected for the SIP bridge secret and the talk room token. However, `getParticipantByDialInPin` and `createGuestByDialIn` have an explicit annotation for `talkSipBridgeSecret` and an implicit protection for `talkRoomToken` due to using `@RequireRoom`, but `getSingleRoom` only has an explicit annotation for `talkRoomToken`.

It would be more correct if both actions have an explicit handling, for example by calling `sleepDelay` and `registerAttempt` instead of `throttle` when the SIP bridge secret can not be validated. Right now it probably makes no difference in practice, as those actions are never reset, but it could have unexpected behaviours if at some point they are. As it is just a "future-proofness" thing it might be enough to add a comment mentioning it.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Missing rate limit when trying to join a password protected Nextcloud Talk conversation

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-pf36-jvpv-4hwq
Aug 8, 2022

## Package

Talk
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 12.2.7, < 13.0.7, < 14.0.3

## Patched versions

12.2.7, 13.0.7, 14.0.3

## Description

### Impact

If the conversation is password protected and an attacker got the link/conversation token, they can brute force the password because there is no brute force protection.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk is upgraded to 12.2.7, 13.0.7 or 14.0.3

### Workarounds

No workaround available apart from not having password protected conversations.

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1596673)
* [PullRequest](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/7504)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
