- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by Cross-site Scripting (XSS), specifically a reflected XSS
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack vector (AV:N), requiring a low level of access complexity (AC:L), a low privilege user (PR:L), and user interaction (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then executed in a victim's browser. This requires a network connection to the application, a low level of complexity, and low privileges, but user interaction is required.
