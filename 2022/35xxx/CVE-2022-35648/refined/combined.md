The recalled firearm sights contain a button cell battery that violates the mandatory federal regulations for consumer products containing button cell batteries because the button cell batteries can be easily accessed, posing an ingestion hazard. The products include a button cell battery which is not in child-resistant packaging as required by Reese’s Law. In addition, the products do not bear the required warnings. When button cell batteries are swallowed, the ingested batteries can cause serious injuries, internal chemical burns and death, posing an ingestion hazard to children.
