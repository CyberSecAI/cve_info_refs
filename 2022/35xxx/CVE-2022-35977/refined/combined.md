Authenticated users issuing specially crafted SETRANGE and SORT(\_RO) commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an OOM panic.

[`137696d`](/redis/redis/commit/137696d80811c25b918f7f543bcbe8c9c142f49d)

Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.

Security Fixes:

* (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis SETRANGE and SORT/SORT\_RO

  commands can drive Redis to OOM panic
* (CVE-2023-22458) Integer overflow in the Redis HRANDFIELD and ZRANDMEMBER

  commands can lead to denial-of-service

# Bug Fixes

* Avoid possible hang when client issues long KEYS, SRANDMEMBER, HRANDFIELD,

  and ZRANDMEMBER commands and gets disconnected by client output buffer limit ([#11676](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11676))
* Fix sentinel issue if replica changes IP ([#11590](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11590))

[`1c75ab0`](/redis/redis/commit/1c75ab062d0cb1f3af57e39a399325b9e917e85f)

Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.

Security Fixes:

* (CVE-2022-35977) Integer overflow in the Redis SETRANGE and SORT/SORT\_RO

  commands can drive Redis to OOM panic
* (CVE-2023-22458) Integer overflow in the Redis HRANDFIELD and ZRANDMEMBER

  commands can lead to denial-of-service

# Bug Fixes

* Avoid possible hang when client issues long KEYS, SRANDMEMBER, HRANDFIELD,

  and ZRANDMEMBER commands and gets disconnected by client output buffer limit ([#11676](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11676))
* Make sure that fork child doesn't do incremental rehashing ([#11692](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11692))
* Fix a bug where blocking commands with a sub-second timeout would block forever ([#11688](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11688))
* Fix sentinel issue if replica changes IP ([#11590](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11590))

# Integer overflow in the Redis SETRANGE and SORT/SORT\_RO commands may result with false OOM panic

Moderate

[yossigo](/yossigo)
published
GHSA-mrcw-fhw9-fj8j
Jan 20, 2023

## Package

Redis
(N/A)

## Affected versions

All versions

## Patched versions

7.0.8, 6.2.9, 6.0.17

## Description

### Impact

Authenticated users issuing specially crafted `SETRANGE` and `SORT(_RO)` commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an OOM panic.

### Patches

The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.8, 6.2.9 and 6.0.17.

### Credit

The issue has been identified by Xion (SeungHyun Lee) of KAIST GoN

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the Redis repository](https://github.com/redis/redis)
* Email us at redis@redis.io

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Avoid integer overflows in SETRANGE and SORT (CVE-2022-35977) ([#11720](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/11720))

```
Authenticated users issuing specially crafted SETRANGE and SORT(_RO)
commands can trigger an integer overflow, resulting with Redis attempting
to allocate impossible amounts of memory and abort with an OOM panic.
