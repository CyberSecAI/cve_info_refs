# Out-of-bounds read in IPv6 neighbor solicitation

Moderate

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-4hpq-4f53-w386
Aug 4, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 4.8

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

Because of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery options in Contiki-NG, attackers can send neighbor solicitation packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read.

The problem exists in the module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c, where memory read operations from the main packet buffer, `uip_buf`, are not checked if they go out of bounds. In particular, this problem can occur when attempting to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address Option (SLLAO).

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include the patch.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1654](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1654).

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/>
* Email us at security@contiki-ng.org

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2022-35926

### Weaknesses

[CWE-125](/advisories?query=cwe%3A125)

### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Sep 28, 2021](#issue-1009820312)

When processing incoming IPv6 neighbor solicitation packets, it is possible for an out-of-bounds read to occur because there are insufficient checks for space with regards to ND option headers.

This PR adds a check for first reading the generic 2-byte option header, and then one check for reading the source-link-layer address option (SLLAO). Note that we are currently only supporting SLLAOs using UIP\_LLADDR\_LEN bytes for the address.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Press release

We are releasing version 4.8 of Contiki-NG. This release adds 64-bit support and performance improvements for Cooja, several security-related fixes, upgraded scripts to python3, and many bug fixes and improvements. The documentation wiki is now moved to read-the-docs for improved readability and maintenance.

Various parts of the user experience for developers have been improved in this release:

* The Contiki-NG build system has been updated with support for ccache ([#1789](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1789)) and improved error checking and reporting.
* Docker image updated to 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 and toolchains in the image upgraded to versions with better error detection.
* Cooja has been updated with improved error checking and reporting

Overall, this will allow the developer to find and eliminate more errors before even starting the application.

## API changes for ports outside the main tree

* `Makefile.customrules-$(TARGET)` is no longer included by default, the name of the makefile has to be added to `MAKEFILES_CUSTOMRULES` by some makefile used by the target. Link to [example](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1908) of in-tree CPU using the API.
