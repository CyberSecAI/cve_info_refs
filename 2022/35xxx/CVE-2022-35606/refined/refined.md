The provided content relates to CVE-2022-35606.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation when constructing SQL queries. Specifically, the application directly concatenates user-supplied input into SQL queries, which is a classic cause for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is SQL injection. Several files are affected:
- `UserDAO.java`: Multiple parameters (user, pass, etc.) are vulnerable.
- `Stocks.java`: The `productcode` parameter is vulnerable.
- `SupplierDAO.java`: The `searchTxt` parameter is vulnerable.
- `ProductDAO.java`: The `searchTxt` parameter is vulnerable.
- `CustomerDAO.java`: Multiple parameters (searchTxt, customercode, etc.) are vulnerable.
- `ConnectionFactory.java`: Multiple parameters (username, password, user, etc.) are vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to:
- Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data from the database.
- Data modification: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
- Privilege escalation: Gaining higher privileges by manipulating database users or roles.
- Denial of service: Causing database errors, performance degradation, or crashing the application.
- Complete compromise of the application and underlying server.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through user input parameters that are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or prepared statements. An attacker can manipulate these parameters by injecting malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests or otherwise interact with the application's user interface or APIs to modify the vulnerable parameters. This generally does not require prior authentication if the vulnerable queries are accessible via publicly facing parts of the application.
The attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL syntax to construct malicious payloads. The examples provided in the issue use `' <SQL Query>--` as a sample payload, which is a common SQL injection technique.
