| **Describe the bug**  The sanic static directory code checks for `../` as a substring of paths, but it also unquotes the path, which allows a malicious user to escape outside the static folder by using `..%2F`, where `%2F` is the URL-escaped version of `/`.  **Code snippet**  First, a basic server called `main.py`.  ``` from sanic import Sanic  app = Sanic(name="sanic_test")  app.static('/static', './static_files')  if __name__ == "__main__":     app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8000) ```  Then create a static file folder.  ``` mkdir static_files cat "hello world" > static_files/a.txt  ```  Now run the server with `python3 main.py` and:  ``` $ curl http://localhost:8000/static/a.txt hello world $ curl http://localhost:8000/static/..%2Fstatic_files/a.txt hello world ```  This is very surprising behavior. From a security perspective it is not critical because sanic checks that the final resolved path has a prefix with the static directory, but this allows an attacker to expose information like the name of the static file folder.  Another case where this is dangerous is if you have a middleware that only allows a user to see certain subpaths like `/static/public/**` of the `/static/**` routes without authentication. Then, even without authentication, a user could visit a path like `/static/public/..%2F/private/secret_content.txt` and retrieve the contents of `/static/private/secret_content.txt`.  **Expected behavior**  Sanic should not allow parent directory traversal in static folders.  **Environment (please complete the following information):**   * OS: macOS and Linux * Version 22.3.2 |

| Related to [#2477](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/2477).  I suppose this can also be exploited by using backslashes, which on Windows would be interpreted as path separators. I suggest denying any escaped slashes and plain backslashes. Processing of `..` (and `.`) ought to be preserved in a logical form, possibly yielding a redirect response, but never traversing parents on the actual filesystem. Somewhat related, all path elements that begin with a dot could be banned (avoiding access to hidden files, which also could be leaking data not intended public).  Python `pathlib` module would be a reasonable option for path processing, avoiding Sanic's own parsing, but concerns include performance and the said special cases with slashes being escaped. Also, whether URL sanitation (avoiding `.` `..` `//` and other oddities) should be applied on all requests and not only static files.  Just my 5 cents. I didn't look at the current code, and in any case this probably needs more thought for a solid implementation. |

| Most browsers and HTTP clients (like cURL) will automatically apply [path normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_normalization#Normalizations_that_preserve_semantics) to URLs, which includes removing dot segments. It's not really necessary to process `..` as a result. |

| Ok, I've given it a try and have ended up with this. Quick things to note:   * I have *not* benchmarked it at all, so if anyone is able to do that I'd be more than grateful! * I believe it should fix both quoted and unquoted traversals (you can try this with cURL by passing `--path-as-is`). * I'm unsure whether lines 827-836 are needed anymore. Feedback welcome. * It *might* fix [Sanic static directory fails when folder name ends with ".." #2477](https://github.com/sanic-org/sanic/issues/2477) too? I haven't tried it, but wondering if it may have done so as a side effect. |
