Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and use of string concatenation to build SQL queries in various Java classes of the `InventoryManagementSystem`. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks due to the insecure construction of SQL queries. Multiple parameters in several classes (`UserDAO.java`, `Stocks.java`, `SupplierDAO.java`, `ProductDAO.java`, `CustomerDAO.java`, and `ConnectionFactory.java`) are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially access, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL code.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker may bypass authentication mechanisms by manipulating SQL queries used for login functionality.
- **Loss of Integrity:** The attacker may alter records in the database and cause loss of integrity
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could disrupt the application by injecting resource-intensive or damaging queries.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through user-supplied inputs within the identified files and parameters:
    - `UserDAO.java`: Parameters like `user`, `pass`
    - `CustomerDAO.java`: Parameters like `searchTxt`, `customercode`
    - `Stocks.java`: Parameter `productcode`
    - `SupplierDAO.java`: Parameter `searchTxt`
    - `ProductDAO.java`: Parameter `searchTxt`
    - `ConnectionFactory.java`: Parameters like `username`, `password`, `user`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate user-controlled input fields, such as login forms, search fields or other forms that use the vulnerable parameters. No specific privileges are needed, just the ability to provide crafted input to the application.
- The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax to craft the malicious queries.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided issue report (#14) on GitHub details the SQL injection vulnerabilities and lists the vulnerable files and parameters, along with Proof-of-Concept (PoC) attack strings.
- The PoC strings provided use the basic SQL injection technique of injecting arbitrary SQL query followed by comment (`' <SQL Query>--`).
- The developer has acknowledged the vulnerability and requested a pull request to fix the issue, which implies they're aware of the problem
