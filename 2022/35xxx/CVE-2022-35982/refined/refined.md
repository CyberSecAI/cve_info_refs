The provided content is related to CVE-2022-35982.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability occurs in the `SparseBincount` operation in TensorFlow. When given invalid inputs for `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape` that do not form a valid sparse tensor, it results in a segmentation fault (segfault).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input validation for sparse tensors in the `SparseBincount` operation.
- The code doesn't check if the provided `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape` are consistent with a valid sparse tensor, allowing out-of-bounds memory access which causes a segfault

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack due to the segfault.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can craft malicious inputs to `SparseBincount`, specifically `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape`, that create an invalid sparse tensor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `SparseBincount` operation.
- The attacker does not need elevated privileges; they just need to be able to execute code that calls the vulnerable operation with malicious inputs.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided content includes the fix for the vulnerability, which adds input validation using `sparse_utils::ValidateSparseTensor`. This validation checks if the `indices`, `values`, and `dense_shape` inputs form a valid sparse tensor before proceeding.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0. The fix has also been cherry-picked for versions 2.9.2, 2.8.3 and 2.7.4.
- The provided code snippets demonstrate how to trigger the vulnerability by providing invalid inputs to the `SparseBincount` operation.
- The vulnerability was reported by Di Jin, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.
