Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the blog post creation functionality of the Amasty Blog Pro extension for Magento 2. Specifically, the `title` field of a blog post allows injection of JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means malicious JavaScript is saved in the database and executed when the affected data is accessed by a user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other admin users' browsers when they are editing or viewing blog posts.
- **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to unauthorized access to admin accounts.
- **Admin account takeover:** By stealing session cookies, the attacker can impersonate an admin user and take over the account.
- **Data Manipulation:** The injected script could also be used to modify or steal sensitive data, deface the website, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Blog Post Creation:** An attacker would need to create a blog post with malicious JavaScript code embedded in the title field through the admin panel.
- **Duplicating the Post:** The malicious code is executed when an admin duplicates a post containing the injected code since the `data.title` field is used without proper sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Admin Panel:** The attacker needs to have at least some level of access to the admin panel of the Magento 2 store. They must be able to create blog posts using the vulnerable Amasty Blog Pro extension.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Component:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable component and the injection point (the blog post title field) to craft the malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**
- The github content provides details on vulnerable endpoint `/admin/amasty_blog/posts/save/key/{some_key}/`
- Affected versions are those prior to 2.10.5.
- The vendor has released an update to version 2.10.5 to address this issue.
