I am using them to generate leads from my website, it‚Äôs really easy to set up. GetResponse offers some nice templates, so it‚Äôs quick to configure.

I‚Äôm using this plugin for few months and it‚Äôs really useful. It allows me to integrate GetResponse to WordPress and add contacts to my list. I can save a lot of time. Right now I have all e-commerce details in GetResponse. Highly recommended.
