Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` operation in TensorFlow incorrectly assumed that the `shape` tensor input would always be of type `int32`.
- When a `shape` tensor of type `int64` is provided, it leads to a type mismatch, triggering a `CHECK` failure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Mismatch:** The code did not handle the case where the shape tensor was not `int32`, leading to a crash.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The `CHECK` failure causes the program to terminate, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause a denial of service by crashing the TensorFlow program.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can provide a `shape` tensor of type `int64` to the `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` operation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the inputs to the `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` operation, specifically the `shape` tensor.
- This would typically require the attacker to be able to influence the TensorFlow graph definition or the data being fed into the graph.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in the GitHub commit [72180be03447a10810edca700cbc9af690dfeb51](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/72180be03447a10810edca700cbc9af690dfeb51).
- The fix addresses the type check and includes a new test case for shape type variations (`int32` and `int64`) in `parameterized_truncated_normal_op_test.py`.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0. Patches were also applied to versions 2.7.4, 2.8.3, and 2.9.2.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Low".
- The vulnerability was reported by Di Jin, Secure Systems Labs, Brown University.
- No CWEs are associated with this vulnerability.
