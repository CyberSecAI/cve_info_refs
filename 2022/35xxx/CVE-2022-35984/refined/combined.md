This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fix tensor shape dtype bug in parameterized\_truncated\_normal.

```
The original made the assumption that the dtype is int32 when it could
also be int64 - leading to a crash due to mismatched type.

# `CHECK` fail in `ParameterizedTruncatedNormal`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-p2xf-8hgm-hpw5
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

`ParameterizedTruncatedNormal` assumes `shape` is of type `int32`. A valid `shape` of type `int64` results in a mismatched type `CHECK` fail that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
seed = 1618
seed2 = 0
shape = tf.random.uniform(shape=[3], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.int64, seed=4894)
means = tf.random.uniform(shape=[3, 3, 3], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.float32, seed=-2971)
stdevs = tf.random.uniform(shape=[3, 3, 3], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.float32, seed=-2971)
minvals = tf.random.uniform(shape=[3, 3, 3], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.float32, seed=-2971)
maxvals = tf.random.uniform(shape=[3, 3, 3], minval=-10000, maxval=10000, dtype=tf.float32, seed=-2971)
tf.raw_ops.ParameterizedTruncatedNormal(shape=shape, means=means, stdevs=stdevs, minvals=minvals, maxvals=maxvals, seed=seed, seed2=seed2)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [72180be03447a10810edca700cbc9af690dfeb51](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/72180be03447a10810edca700cbc9af690dfeb51).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
