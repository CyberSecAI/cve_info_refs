Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from sensitive data being written to trace files when tracing is enabled in IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive data within trace files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  The exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, potentially compromising the security of the system. The impact is dependent on the type of sensitive data exposed.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves enabling tracing within IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru, which then causes sensitive information to be written to trace files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need the ability to enable tracing on the IBM MQ Internet Pass-Thru instance. The attacker would likely also need access to the generated trace files to extract the sensitive data.
