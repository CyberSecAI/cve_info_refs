# Singleplayer: Lua sandbox escape from mod

High

[sfan5](/sfan5)
published
GHSA-663q-pcjw-27cc
Aug 12, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=5.5.1

## Patched versions

5.6.0

## Description

### Impact

In **single player**, a mod can set a global setting that controls the Lua script loaded to display the main menu. The script is then loaded as soon as the game session is exited.

The Lua environment the menu runs in is not sandboxed and can directly interfere with the user's system.

### Patches

[da71e86](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/commit/da71e86633d0b27cd02d7aac9fdac625d141ca13)

### Workarounds

None possible (you need to update Minetest or apply the patch)

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
