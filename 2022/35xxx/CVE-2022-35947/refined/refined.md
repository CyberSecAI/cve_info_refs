{
  "CVE-2022-35947": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on the token parameter in the authentication process. Specifically, the `getFromDBbyToken` function was not properly validating that the token was a string, allowing for an SQL injection when a crafted array was passed instead.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "SQL injection (CWE-89)",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the authentication process and simulate a login to any user that has a defined API token.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the GLPI application."
