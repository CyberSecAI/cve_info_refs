{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the vulnerable page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious script is inserted into the `CATEGORY` field while editing a category. This input is then displayed without proper sanitization.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin panel and have the capability to edit categories. Specifically, they need to send a POST request to `/eris/admin/category/controller.php?action=edit` with a malicious script in the `CATEGORY` parameter."
