Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2022-35936.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `DeleteAccount` function within the Ethermint's EVM module. When a contract uses the `selfdestruct` opcode, the function removes the contract's bytecode from the internal database. The issue was that it would remove the bytecode even if other contracts were using the same bytecode, effectively disabling them.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of contract self-destruction: The system deletes the bytecode associated with a contract when `selfdestruct` is called, even if other contracts are using the same bytecode.
- Shared bytecode storage: The system stores contract bytecode as a key-value pair, with the bytecode hash as the key. This storage is shared by contracts with identical bytecode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): An attacker can deploy a copy of a vulnerable contract and trigger the `selfdestruct` opcode, causing the original contract (and any other contracts using the same bytecode) to stop functioning.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker can trigger the vulnerability through a smart contract interaction, which is done over the network.
- The attacker can deploy a contract.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deploy contracts to the network.
- The attacker needs to be able to call the selfdestruct function of a contract with an identical bytecode to the targeted contract.
