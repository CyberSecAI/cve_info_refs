# Floating point exception in `Conv2D`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-q5jv-m6qw-5g37
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

If `Conv2D` is given empty `input` and the `filter` and `padding` sizes are valid, the output is all-zeros. This causes division-by-zero floating point exceptions that can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
with tf.device("CPU"): # also can be triggerred on GPU
   input = np.ones([1, 0, 2, 1])
   filter = np.ones([1, 1, 1, 1])
   strides = ([1, 1, 1, 1])
   padding = "EXPLICIT"
   explicit_paddings = [0 , 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
   data_format = "NHWC"
   res = tf.raw_ops.Conv2D(
       input=input,
       filter=filter,
       strides=strides,
       padding=padding,
        explicit_paddings=explicit_paddings,
       data_format=data_format,
  )
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [611d80db29dd7b0cfb755772c69d60ae5bca05f9](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/611d80db29dd7b0cfb755772c69d60ae5bca05f9).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

Fix conv2d crash when input size is empty.

```
If the input is empty (so convolution is only applied to padding), and if
the filter and padding sizes are still valid, then the output will be
all-zeros.  This previously caused a division-by-zero crash in multiple
kernels.
