## What is it?

`wkhtmltopdf` and `wkhtmltoimage` are open source (LGPLv3) command line tools to render HTML into PDF and various image formats using the Qt WebKit rendering engine. These run entirely "headless" and do not require a display or display service.

There is also a C library, if you're into that kind of thing.

## How do I use it?

1. [Download a precompiled binary](downloads.html) or build [from source](https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf)
2. Create your HTML document that you want to turn into a PDF (or image)
3. Run your HTML document through the tool.

   For example, if I really like the treatment [Google](http://google.com) has done to their logo today and want to capture it forever as a PDF:

   `wkhtmltopdf http://google.com google.pdf`

## Additional options

That's great, I've always wanted to turn Google's homepage into a PDF, but I want a table of contents as well.

There are plenty of command line options. Check out the [auto-generated wkhtmltopdf manual](usage/wkhtmltopdf.txt).
## Get Hardcore

Command line tools are awesome, but I want a C library.

No problem. Check out the [library documentation](libwkhtmltox).

## Real world examples?

Like we said, if you really like Google's homepage today and want to save it as a PDF, you could use wkhtmltopdf for that.

Seriously, you could use it to generate invoices, create birthday cards, or all other sorts of fun things. Just use your imagination!
