Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35910:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "repository name" field within the Jellyfin plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the "repository name" field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** While not the primary cause for this CVE, the report highlights that an unprivileged user can access the admin panel and save new plugin repositories. This lack of proper access control facilitates the exploitation of the XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code, an attacker can steal the administrator's session access token stored in the browser's local storage.
- **Privilege Escalation:** With the stolen access token, the attacker can impersonate the administrator, gaining full control over the Jellyfin server. This includes the ability to create new users, delete existing users, access restricted media, and perform other administrative functions.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided text, stored XSS can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the browser accessing the page.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **Unauthenticated user**: An attacker needs to have access to the Jellyfin instance (no authentication is required to register as a user)
2.  **Plugin Settings Access:** The attacker must navigate to the plugin settings within the Jellyfin interface.
3.  **Malicious Input Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into the "repository name" field, which is then saved into the system.
4.  **Targeted User Action:** The malicious payload is triggered when a user (preferably an administrator) logs in and accesses the plugins/repositories tab.
5.  **Token Theft:** The injected payload sends the administrator's local storage content (including the access token) to the attacker.
6.  **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker uses the stolen access token to perform privileged operations like editing the administrator's privilege through the "/users" endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have a user account on the Jellyfin server.
- The attacker must have access to the Jellyfin web interface.
- The attacker needs the ability to save a plugin repository to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was present in Jellyfin version 10.7.7 and was fixed in version 10.8.0.
- The provided information suggests that the combination of insufficient access controls and stored XSS leads to a critical security vulnerability.
- The report details the exploitation process including how to identify the admin user id, how to access the admin panel as a user, and how to steal the admin token using a simple XSS payload.

The github content does not contain any vulnerability information regarding CVE-2022-35910, it only shows a code change that enforces authorization when saving plugin repositories, but this does not fix the vulnerability. The google doc content is irrelevant.
