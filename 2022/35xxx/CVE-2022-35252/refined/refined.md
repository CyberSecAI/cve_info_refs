Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35252:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided documents confirm the relevance of CVE-2022-35252, as it is explicitly mentioned in the context of curl updates for:

*   macOS Big Sur 11.7.3 (from seclists.org)
*   macOS Monterey 12.6.3 (from support.apple.com)
*   NetApp products (from security.netapp.com and security.netapp.com_3cf4a1eb)
*   Debian LTS (from lists.debian.org)
*   Gentoo (from security.gentoo.org)

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how `curl` handles control codes (byte values below 32) within HTTP cookies.  Specifically:

*   `curl` versions 4.9 through 7.84.0 incorrectly accept and parse cookies that contain control codes.
*   When these cookies with control codes are subsequently sent back to an HTTP(S) server, the server might reject the request with a 400 response.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is `curl`'s failure to properly validate the syntactic correctness of HTTP cookie input, allowing control codes that should be rejected.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** This leads to a potential DoS vulnerability, as a malicious server can send cookies with control codes, which `curl` will accept. When `curl` sends these back in a request, the target server can respond with an error, effectively preventing the client from accessing the server.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, where a server can cause a client to be unable to successfully make requests to it.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP Server:** A malicious or compromised HTTP server can send a `Set-Cookie` header containing control codes.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker performing a MitM attack can inject cookies with control codes into the stream between a client and server.
*   **Sister Site Exploitation:** A "sister" site, which can set cookies for the target domain, can use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service to siblings on the same domain.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the `curl` clientâ€™s cookie store, either by controlling a server that sets cookies or being able to perform a MitM attack.
*   **No Privileges Needed:** The vulnerability does not require any special privileges on the targeted system to be exploited.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in `curl` version 4.9.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in `curl` version 7.85.0 and later.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that their products are affected when using libcurl versions 4.9 through 7.84.0.
*   The Apple security advisories state that the issue was resolved by updating to curl version 7.85.0.
*   The Debian advisory indicates that the fix is included in `curl` version 7.64.0-4+deb10u4.
*   The Gentoo advisory recommends upgrading to `curl` version 7.86.0 or later.

In summary, CVE-2022-35252 is a relatively low severity vulnerability in `curl` that could lead to a denial-of-service condition due to improper handling of control characters in cookies. The fix involves updating to `curl` version 7.85.0 or later.
