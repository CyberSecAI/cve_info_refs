Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35940:

**Root Cause:**

- The `RaggedRangeOp` function in TensorFlow takes a `limits` argument, which is used to calculate the size of the output tensor. This size is computed as `ceil(abs((limit - start) / delta))` when the type is floating-point.
- The result of this calculation is implicitly converted to an `int64`.
- If the calculated size is a very large float that exceeds the maximum value of `int64_t`, it causes an integer overflow during the conversion to `int64_t`, triggering an `InvalidArgument` error and leading to program termination.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- Integer overflow.
- Lack of proper bounds checking on the result of the calculation before conversion to `int64_t`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The program crashes due to an abort signal after the `InvalidArgument` error.
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can cause the TensorFlow program to crash by providing carefully crafted input values for `limits`, `start` and `delta`, leading to an integer overflow during tensor shape construction.

**Attack Vectors:**

- By crafting specific input values for the `starts`, `limits`, and `deltas` arguments to the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedRange` function.
  - Specifically, `limits` needs to be a very large floating-point value.
  - The values of `start` and `delta` must also be chosen to produce a large value when computing `(limit - start) / delta` before the ceiling operation, such that when it is cast to int64 it will cause an overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `tf.raw_ops.RaggedRange` operation. This usually means having control over the data being fed into the TensorFlow model or by using crafted inputs to trigger the vulnerability directly.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided code snippets show the fix for this vulnerability in commit `37cefa91bee4eace55715eeef43720b958a01192`. The fix includes a check to ensure that the calculated size does not exceed the maximum value of `int64_t` using `OP_REQUIRES` before casting the value to `int64_t`.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0. Patched versions include 2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, and 2.10.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as "Low" severity.
- The vulnerability was reported by Jingyi Shi.
