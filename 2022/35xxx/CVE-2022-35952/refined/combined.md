# `CHECK` failures in `UnbatchGradOp`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-h5vq-gw2c-pq47
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

The [`UnbatchGradOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/769eddaf479c8debead9a59a72617d6ed6f0fe10/tensorflow/core/kernels/batch_kernels.cc#L891) function takes an argument `id` that is assumed to be a scalar. A nonscalar `id` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program.

```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# `id` is not scalar
tf.raw_ops.UnbatchGrad(original_input= tf.constant([1]),batch_index=tf.constant([[0,0,0 ], ], dtype=tf.int64),grad=tf.constant([1,]),id=tf.constant([1,1,], dtype=tf.int64))
```

It also requires its argument `batch_index` to contain three times the number of elements as indicated in its `batch_index.dim_size(0)`. An incorrect `batch_index` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program.

```
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf

# batch_index's size is not 3
tf.raw_ops.UnbatchGrad(original_input= tf.constant([1]),batch_index=tf.constant([[0,0], ], dtype=tf.int64),grad=tf.constant([1,]),id=tf.constant([1,], dtype=tf.int64))
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [5f945fc6409a3c1e90d6970c9292f805f6e6ddf2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/5f945fc6409a3c1e90d6970c9292f805f6e6ddf2).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
