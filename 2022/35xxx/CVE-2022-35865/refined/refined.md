- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the HTTP module of BMC Track-It!, specifically a lack of authentication before allowing access to certain functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for HTTP requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the service account.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required; the attacker can be unauthenticated and remote.
