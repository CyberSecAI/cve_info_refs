Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-35508:

**CVE-2022-35508:** This CVE ID is assigned to the **CRLF injection in response headers** vulnerability described in the blog post.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The server uses a regex to match the first line of the error message to avoid additional lines breaking the HTTP response. However, this regex only prevents LF (%0a) and does not prevent CR (%0d), allowing for CRLF injection.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **CRLF Injection:**  The server fails to properly sanitize error messages, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return characters (`\r` or `%0d`) into the HTTP response headers. This leads to the ability to inject arbitrary headers in some browsers.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a long cookie header using CRLF injection, an attacker can cause subsequent requests from a victim's browser to the PVE/PMG server to fail, effectively denying access to the web interface until the victim clears their cookies.
    *   This vulnerability is limited to Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, etc.), as Firefox does not recognize CR without LF as a valid newline indicator.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can craft a malicious webpage to set long cookies on the victim's PVE/PMG domain.
    *   When the victim visits the malicious webpage, their browser will store the long cookies for the PVE/PMG domain.
    *   Subsequent requests to the PVE/PMG domain from the victim's browser will include the long cookie header, exceeding the server's header size limit and causing the server to reject the requests, resulting in a DoS.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that can be accessed by the victim's browser.
    *   The attacker needs no authentication to perform this attack.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerable code in `perl5/PVE/APIServer/AnyEvent.pm` and the steps to trigger the vulnerability.
*   It mentions that the vulnerability was patched in `pve-http-server` version `4.1-3` by adding an additional check for `\r\n`.
*   The blog post also notes that Chrome allows third-party cookies by default, which is a necessary condition for the client-side DoS attack.
