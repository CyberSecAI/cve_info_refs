# `CHECK` failure in `AvgPoolOp`

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-mgmh-g2v6-mqw5
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

The [`AvgPoolOp`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/avgpooling_op.cc#L56-L98) function takes an argument `ksize` that must be positive but is not checked. A negative `ksize` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the program.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

value = np.ones([1, 1, 1, 1])
ksize = [1, 1e20, 1, 1]
strides = [1, 1, 1, 1]
padding = 'SAME'
data_format = 'NHWC'

tf.raw_ops.AvgPool(value=value, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding, data_format=data_format)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [3a6ac52664c6c095aa2b114e742b0aa17fdce78f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/3a6ac52664c6c095aa2b114e742b0aa17fdce78f).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
