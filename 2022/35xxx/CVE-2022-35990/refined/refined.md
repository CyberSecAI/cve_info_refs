Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35990:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper input validation in the `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel_gradient` and `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_gradient` functions. Specifically, the code did not check if the `min` and `max` tensors provided as input had the expected rank (1 for `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannelGradientOp` and 0 for `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsGradientOp`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing input validation:** The core issue is the absence of rank checks for `min` and `max` tensors within the `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsGradientOp` and `FakeQuantWithMinMaxVarsPerChannelGradientOp` operations.
- **`CHECK` failure:** When an input tensor with an unexpected rank is provided, it leads to a `CHECK` failure, which is a type of assertion failure that terminates the program abruptly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can trigger a DoS by providing maliciously crafted input tensors with incorrect rank to the vulnerable functions, which causes a `CHECK` failure and terminates the TensorFlow process or application using these operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct API call:** The vulnerability is exploitable by directly calling the `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_per_channel_gradient` or `tf.quantization.fake_quant_with_min_max_vars_gradient` functions with crafted `min` or `max` tensors.
- **Model poisoning:** An attacker might be able to craft a malicious model that uses the vulnerable operations with incorrect input, which could cause a crash upon inference.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to provide inputs:** The attacker needs the capability to supply input tensors to the vulnerable `tf.quantization` functions or inject a malicious model containing these operations. This could be achieved through:
    - Directly constructing TensorFlow code and invoking the functions.
    - Manipulating input tensors to a model during training or inference if the model contains those functions.
- **Understanding of the API:** The attacker needs to know that the `min` and `max` inputs are expected to be rank 0 (scalar) or rank 1 (vector).

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented in commit `f3cf67ac5705f4f04721d15e485e192bb319feed` adds explicit rank checks to validate that `min` and `max` tensors have the expected ranks before further processing.
- The commit also includes unit tests that specifically check for invalid input scenarios, ensuring that the fix is effective and regression is avoided in the future.
- The vulnerability was present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.10.0. Patches were backported to supported older versions such as 2.7.4, 2.8.3 and 2.9.2.
- The severity is considered "Low", likely because the impact is a denial-of-service through a check failure, as opposed to other more serious vulnerabilities.
