Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35972:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing input validation checks within the `QuantizedBiasAdd` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, the `min_input`, `max_input`, `min_bias`, and `max_bias` tensors were not validated to ensure they are scalar (rank 0) tensors.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing input validation:** The core issue is the absence of checks to verify the rank of the `min_input`, `max_input`, `min_bias`, and `max_bias` tensors.
- **Type confusion:** When these tensors are provided with ranks greater than 0, it results in a type confusion that leads to a segmentation fault.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a segfault, effectively crashing the TensorFlow application and leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious input:** An attacker can craft a TensorFlow model or graph that provides non-scalar tensors for `min_input`, `max_input`, `min_bias`, and `max_bias` to the `QuantizedBiasAdd` operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to supply crafted input tensors to a TensorFlow application that utilizes the vulnerable `QuantizedBiasAdd` operation. This could be achieved by manipulating input data, modifying model files, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject the malicious input.

**Additional Details from the Patches:**
The provided patch commit `785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0` shows that fixes were made to the following files:

- `tensorflow/core/kernels/fake_quant_ops.cc`: Added checks to ensure that `min` and `max` tensors are scalar.
- `tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_bias_add_op.cc`: Added checks to ensure `min_input`, `max_input`, `min_bias`, `max_bias` are scalar tensors.
- `tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_bias_add_op_test.cc`:  The test was updated to use scalar tensors, where before it was using tensors with shape {1}.
- `tensorflow/core/kernels/quantized_instance_norm.cc`: Added checks to ensure `x_min` and `x_max` tensors are scalar.
- `tensorflow/core/kernels/requantize.cc`: Added checks to ensure `input_min`, `input_max`, `requested_output_min`, and `requested_output_max` are scalar.
- `tensorflow/core/kernels/requantize_op_test.cc`: The test was updated to use scalar tensors.

These changes demonstrate that the primary fix was to enforce scalar tensor shapes for the min/max inputs in various quantization operations, preventing the type confusion that led to the segfault.
