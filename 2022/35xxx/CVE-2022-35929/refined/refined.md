Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the logic of `cosign verify-attestation` when used with the `--type` flag. The tool incorrectly reports a successful verification when:

1. There is at least one attestation with a valid signature.
2. There are *no* attestations matching the specified `--type`.

Essentially, the tool was not correctly enforcing that an attestation of the specified type exists before considering the verification successful.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **False Positive Verification:** The primary weakness is that `cosign` could report a successful verification even when the required type of attestation was not present. This leads to a false sense of security.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypassed Verification:** An attacker could potentially bypass intended verification checks by ensuring no attestations match a specific type requested via `--type` in `cosign`. The tool would incorrectly report success despite missing the specific attestation.
*   **Security Risk:** This would mean that the system relying on `cosign` attestation verification might be vulnerable because the verification tool was not accurately checking for the presence of an attestation that the user expected to exist.
*   **Incorrect Security Posture:** If a system depends on specific attestation types for policy enforcement, this vulnerability could lead to an incorrect security posture where policies are not applied correctly because of the false positive verification result.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Attestations:** An attacker could create a signed image with a valid attestation of a different type, and then use `cosign verify-attestation --type <desired_type>` and cause it to pass the verification even though no attestation of `<desired_type>` exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Image Creation and Signing:** The attacker needs the ability to create and sign container images with attestations of *at least one type*.
*   **Control over Attestation Type:** The attacker can influence what kind of attestation types get attached to a container image.
*   **Awareness of Verification Process:** The attacker needs to be aware of how the `cosign verify-attestation` command with `--type` works and exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Versions:** cosign versions prior to 1.10.1 are affected.
*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed in cosign version 1.10.1 and later.
*   **Reproducibility:** The vulnerability can be reproduced using the provided example with the `distroless.dev/static@sha256:dd7614b5a12bc4d617b223c588b4e0c833402b8f4991fb5702ea83afad1986e2` image.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the `checked` list of attestations (those that match the specified type and pass policy checks) is non-empty before proceeding to the verification step.
