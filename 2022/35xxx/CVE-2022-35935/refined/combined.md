# `CHECK` failure in `SobolSample` via missing validation

Low

[pak-laura](/pak-laura)
published
GHSA-97p7-w86h-vcf9
Sep 15, 2022

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.10.0

## Patched versions

2.7.4, 2.8.3, 2.9.2, 2.10.0

## Description

### Impact

The implementation of SobolSampleOp is vulnerable to a denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by assuming `input(0)`, `input(1)`, and `input(2)` to be scalar.

```
import tensorflow as tf
tf.raw_ops.SobolSample(dim=tf.constant([1,0]), num_results=tf.constant([1]), skip=tf.constant([1]))
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/c65c67f88ad770662e8f191269a907bf2b94b1bf).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution
