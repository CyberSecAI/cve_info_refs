```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `SobolSampleOp` implementation in TensorFlow assumes that the inputs `dim`, `num_results`, and `skip` are scalar values without proper validation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code lacks proper input validation, leading to a `CHECK`-failure (assertion failure) when non-scalar tensors are passed as inputs.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A denial-of-service (DoS) can be triggered by providing non-scalar tensors to `SobolSampleOp` which leads to a program crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by calling the `SobolSampleOp` with non-scalar tensors as input through the `tf.raw_ops.SobolSample` interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the `SobolSampleOp` function in TensorFlow. No special privileges are required, only the ability to execute TensorFlow code."
