- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the web server being susceptible to Slowloris attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system is vulnerable to Slowloris HTTP denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. This type of attack exploits threaded web servers by sending slow, incomplete HTTP requests, holding connections open and eventually exhausting server resources.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial of service, making the system unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out over HTTP, by sending multiple incomplete requests, which are left open.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No specific authentication is needed for the attack to work.
