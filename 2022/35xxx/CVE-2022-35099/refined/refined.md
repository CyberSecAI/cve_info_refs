The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities discovered in swftools' pdf2swf tool. These vulnerabilities include heap buffer overflows, stack buffer overflows, global buffer overflows, segmentation faults (SEGV), floating-point exceptions (FPE), and out-of-memory errors. The root cause is related to parsing and processing of crafted PDF files.

Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability type, as described in the content:

**1. Heap Buffer Overflow:**

*   **Root Cause:** Occurs during the processing of image data, specifically within DCTStream::readHuffSym, GfxICCBasedColorSpace::getDefaultColor, and draw_stroke functions, or during DCTStream::reset.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper bounds checking or memory allocation when handling image data, ICC profiles, or during stroke drawing.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to application crashes (denial of service) and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted PDF files containing specially crafted image data or color profiles, triggering the vulnerability when processed by `pdf2swf`.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify PDF documents.

**2. Stack Buffer Overflow:**
*   **Root Cause:** Writing beyond the bounds of a stack allocated buffer in `ImageStream::getPixel` function during image processing within `VectorGraphicOutputDev::drawGeneralImage`.
*  **Weaknesses:** Lack of boundary checks when writing to stack allocated memory.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to application crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting return addresses on the stack.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted PDF files containing specially crafted image data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify PDF documents.

**3. Global Buffer Overflow:**

*   **Root Cause:** Occurs during the processing of image data, specifically within `DCTStream::transformDataUnit`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Incorrect bounds checking when accessing global variables.
*   **Impact:**  Application crashes due to memory corruption, potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF files with specific image data that causes out-of-bounds reads in the global memory.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify PDF documents.

**4. Segmentation Faults (SEGV):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Various issues in different parts of the code, including `FoFiTrueType::writeTTF`, `convert_gfxline`, `gfxline_getbbox`, `memset` within `InfoOutputDev::type3D0`, and `InfoOutputDev::type3D1`
*   **Weaknesses:**  Dereferencing invalid memory addresses or null pointers during font processing, line conversion, or text rendering.
*   **Impact:** Causes application crashes (denial of service).
*   **Attack Vectors:** Maliciously crafted PDF files containing specific font or graphic data.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify PDF documents.

**5. Floating-Point Exception (FPE):**

*   **Root Cause:** A division by zero or similar arithmetic error during DCT stream processing within `DCTStream::readMCURow`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of checks for zero divisors during image processing.
*   **Impact:** Leads to application crashes.
*  **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF files with specific image data that leads to a division by zero during processing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify PDF documents.

**6. Out of Memory:**

*    **Root Cause:**  Attempt to allocate a large amount of memory leading to out of memory error during `draw_stroke`.
*    **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper resource management and memory allocation handling.
*    **Impact:** Application crash due to memory allocation failure.
*    **Attack Vectors:** Crafted PDF files that trigger excessive memory allocation.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to create or modify PDF documents.
