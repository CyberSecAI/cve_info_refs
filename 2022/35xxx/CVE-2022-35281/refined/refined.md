Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a CSV injection issue, which occurs when user-controlled data is included in a CSV file without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data before exporting it to a CSV file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- When a user opens a crafted CSV file in a spreadsheet application, malicious formulas or scripts could be executed without user consent.
- This can lead to various security risks, such as information disclosure, data manipulation, or even complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can inject malicious content into fields that are exported to CSV files.
- When the CSV file is opened by an unsuspecting user, the injected formulas/scripts are executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to insert or manipulate data that will be exported into a CSV file.
- The attack requires a user to open the crafted CSV file using an application such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, in which the injected formulas/scripts will be executed.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM Maximo Asset Management versions 7.6.1.1, 7.6.1.2, and 7.6.1.3
- IBM Maximo Application Suite - Manage Component versions 8.3 and 8.4
