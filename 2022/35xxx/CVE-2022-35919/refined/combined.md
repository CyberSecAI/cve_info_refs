It is possible for anyone with admin access to relatively
to get any content of any random OS location by simply
providing the file with 'mc admin update alias/ /etc/passwd`.

Workaround is to disable 'admin:ServiceUpdate' action. Everyone
is advised to upgrade to this patch.

## Description

do not allow filesystem fallback in server download

## Motivation and Context

It is possible for anyone with admin access to relatively

to get any content of any random OS location by simply

providing the file with 'mc admin update alias/ /etc/passwd`.

A workaround is to disable 'admin:ServiceUpdate' action. Everyone

is advised to upgrade to this patch.

Thanks to [@Alevsk](https://github.com/Alevsk) for finding this bug.

## How to test this PR?

Perform `mc admin update alias/ /etc/passwd` you will see '/etc/passwd' in the error response.

## Types of changes

* Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
* New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
* Optimization (provides speedup with no functional changes)
* Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change)

## Checklist:

* Fixes a regression (If yes, please add `commit-id` or `PR #` here)
* Documentation updated
* Unit tests added/updated

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Authenticated requests for server update admin API allows path traversal

High

[minio-trusted](/minio-trusted)
published
GHSA-gr9v-6pcm-rqvg
Jul 29, 2022

## Package

gomod

minio
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= RELEASE.2020-07-24T22-43-05Z

## Patched versions

RELEASE.2022-07-29T19-40-48Z

## Description

### Impact

All 'admin' users authorized for `admin:ServerUpdate` can selectively trigger an error that in

response, in turn, returns the content of the path requested for example

```
mc admin update alias/ /etc/passwd

```

The contents of `/etc/passwd` are returned back with an error response, so any normal

OS system would allow access to contents at any arbitrary paths that are readable by

MinIO process.

This issue was discovered by [@Alevsk](https://github.com/Alevsk) during an internal security audit. The affected

code has been removed from the repository.

### Patches

```
commit bc72e4226e669d98c8e0f3eccc9297be9251c692
Author: Harshavardhana <harsha@minio.io>
Date:   Thu Jul 28 17:44:21 2022 -0700

    do not allow filesystem fallback in server download (#15429)

    It is possible for anyone with admin access to relatively
    to get any content of any random OS location by simply
    providing the file with 'mc admin update alias/ /etc/passwd`.

    Workaround is to disable 'admin:ServiceUpdate' action. Everyone
    is advised to upgrade to this patch.

    Thanks to @alevsk for finding this bug.

```
### Workarounds

You can disable ServerUpdate API by denying the `admin:ServerUpdate` action for your admin users via IAM policies.

For example an explicit "Deny" for "admin:ServerUpdate" until you can upgrade the affected systems to the latest releases.

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "admin:*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "admin:ServerUpdate"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
