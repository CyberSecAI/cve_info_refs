Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-35919:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the server download functionality in MinIO, specifically within the `admin:ServiceUpdate` API. The server download function was not properly validating the provided file path and would fall back to reading arbitrary files from the filesystem if the provided path was not a valid URL. This allowed an attacker to bypass intended restrictions and access files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server via the `mc admin update alias/ <path>` command.
*   **Insecure Fallback:** The server download function incorrectly fell back to the local filesystem when the provided path was not a URL

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker with `admin:ServerUpdate` privileges can read the contents of any file on the server that the MinIO process has read access to. This includes sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack is carried out using the `mc admin update` command, which is part of the MinIO command-line client.
*   The attacker provides a local file path instead of a URL as an argument to the update command, triggering the filesystem fallback.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have admin privileges with the `admin:ServerUpdate` permission.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during an internal security audit by @Alevsk.
*   The fix involves removing the filesystem fallback behavior in the server download function.
*   A workaround is provided, which is to disable the `admin:ServerUpdate` action via IAM policies.
*   The vulnerability is considered high severity.
*   The vulnerable code was present in versions >= `RELEASE.2020-07-24T22-43-05Z` and patched in `RELEASE.2022-07-29T19-40-48Z`
