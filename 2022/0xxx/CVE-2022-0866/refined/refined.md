Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a concurrency issue within the Wildfly application server when using Elytron Security. Specifically, the `EJBComponent` class's `incomingRunAsIdentity` field, which is meant to store the current security identity before switching to a new identity via a RunAs principal, is not thread-safe. This field is only a `SecurityIdentity` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Caller Principal:** In a highly concurrent environment, when multiple users invoke an EJB configured with a RunAs principal, the `EJBComponent#getCallerPrincipal` method can return the wrong caller principal.
- **Incorrect Role Checks:** Similarly, the `EJBComponent#isCallerInRole` method can also return incorrect values due to the shared, non-thread-safe `incomingRunAsIdentity` field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Improper Access to Information:** An attacker can gain access to information they should not have due to the incorrect principal being returned, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data exposure.
- **Authorization Bypass:** Incorrect role checks can lead to authorization bypass vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Concurrent EJB Invocation:** The attack vector involves concurrent invocation of an EJB that is configured with a RunAs principal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger concurrent invocations of an EJB configured with a RunAs principal. This would typically involve being able to make requests to the server that lead to such invocations.
- No special privileges are required, as the issue arises from the server's handling of concurrent requests when the RunAs principal is configured.

**Additional details:**
- The issue affects Wildfly versions before 26.1.1.Final and 27.0.0.Alpha2.
- The vulnerability is related to how Wildfly manages EJB session contexts and the switching of identities.
