- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when deleting transactions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing CSRF check in the transaction deletion functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into deleting arbitrary transactions without their knowledge or consent.
- **Attack vectors**: CSRF attack. An attacker crafts a malicious link or HTML form that, when triggered by a logged-in admin, sends a request to delete a specific transaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince a logged-in administrator to click a malicious link or submit a crafted form.
