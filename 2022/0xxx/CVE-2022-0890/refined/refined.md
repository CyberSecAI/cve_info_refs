The provided content is related to a commit in the mruby repository, specifically focusing on changes made to `fiber.c`. The commit message is "fiber.c: should pack 15+ arguments in an array.". This change is related to how arguments are handled when resuming a fiber. While the commit message and code diff provide insight into the fix, they do not explicitly describe a vulnerability or an exploit scenario.

Based on the content, it seems the vulnerability might be related to stack overflow or incorrect argument handling when a fiber is resumed with 15 or more arguments before the fix was applied. 

Here is a breakdown based on the provided information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code in `fiber.c` did not correctly handle cases where a fiber was resumed with 15 or more arguments. It seems that the arguments were copied directly onto the stack which could potentially lead to an overflow if not handled properly.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Potential stack overflow vulnerability related to incorrect argument handling when resuming fibers with many arguments.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A stack overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by resuming a fiber with 15 or more arguments.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the number of arguments passed when resuming a fiber.
- Ability to create and interact with fibers.

**Additional details (beyond official CVE description):**

- Before this fix, the `fiber_switch` function would copy the arguments directly to the stack when resuming a fiber. With 15 or more arguments, this could lead to a stack overflow if the stack was not extended sufficiently.
- The fix introduces a check for arguments greater than or equal to 15. If this is the case, the arguments are packed into an array, and that array is placed on the stack, effectively preventing the potential overflow.
- The commit also extends the stack by 3 extra slots in the case of >= 15 arguments for: receiver, args (packed array) and (optional) block.

**Note:** It is important to note that there's no official CVE description to confirm the relationship between this commit and CVE-2022-0890.
