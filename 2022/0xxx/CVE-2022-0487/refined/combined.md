Debian Bug     : 990279

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-36310

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for AMD processors,
    which could lead to an infinite loop.  A malicious VM guest could
    exploit this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This is partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged users
    with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This is
    already the default in Debian 11 "bullseye".

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-25636

    Nick Gregory reported a heap out-of-bounds write flaw in the
    netfilter subsystem. A user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.10.103-1.  This update additionally includes many more
bug fixes from stable updates 5.10.93-5.10.103 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Debian Bug     : 990411

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2021-3640

    LinMa of BlockSec Team discovered a race condition in the
    Bluetooth SCO implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A
    local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered a race condition in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-29264

    It was discovered that the "gianfar" Ethernet driver used with
    some Freescale SoCs did not correctly handle a Rx queue overrun
    when jumbo packets were enabled.  On systems using this driver and
    jumbo packets, an attacker on the network could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service (crash).

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-33033

    The syzbot tool found a reference counting bug in the CIPSO
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.

    This protocol is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39714

    A potential reference count overflow was found in the Android Ion
    driver.  On systems where the Ion driver is loaded, a local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-24448

    Description

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

memstick: rtsx\_usb\_ms: fix UAFThis patch fixes the following issues:
1. memstick\_free\_host() will free the host, so the use of ms\_dev(host) after
it will be a problem. To fix this, move memstick\_free\_host() after when we
are done with ms\_dev(host).
2. In rtsx\_usb\_ms\_drv\_remove(), pm need to be disabled before we remove
and free host otherwise memstick\_check will be called and UAF will
happen.

Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-38300

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
    compiler for MIPS architectures.  A local user could exploit
    this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
    net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0, which is the default.  It is *not*
    mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43975

    Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
    hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
    device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-44733

    A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  A local user permitted to access a TEE
    device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2021-45469

    Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
    implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
    attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.19.232-1.  This update additionally includes many
more bug fixes from stable updates 4.19.209-4.19.232 inclusive.

Debian Bug     : 988044 989285 990411 994050

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-29374

    Jann Horn of Google reported a flaw in Linux's virtual memory
    management.  A parent and child process initially share all their
    memory, but when either writes to a shared page, the page is
    duplicated and unshared (copy-on-write).  However, in case an
    operation such as vmsplice() required the kernel to take an
    additional reference to a shared page, and a copy-on-write occurs
    during this operation, the kernel might have accessed the wrong
    process's memory.  For some programs, this could lead to an
    information leak or data corruption.

    This issue was already fixed for most architectures, but not on
    MIPS and System z.  This update corrects that.

CVE-2020-36322, CVE-2021-28950

    The syzbot tool found that the FUSE (filesystem-in-user-space)
    implementation did not correctly handle a FUSE server returning
    invalid attributes for a file.  A local user permitted to run a
    FUSE server could use this to cause a denial of service (crash).

    The original fix for this introduced a different potential denial
    of service (infinite loop in kernel space), which has also been
    fixed.

CVE-2021-3640

    Lin Ma discovered a race condiiton in the Bluetooth protocol
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3744, CVE-2021-3764

    minihanshen reported bugs in the ccp driver for AMD
    Cryptographic Coprocessors that could lead to a resource leak.
    On systems using this driver, a local user could exploit this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-3752

    Likang Luo of NSFOCUS Security Team discovered a flaw in the
    Bluetooth L2CAP implementation that can lead to a user-after-free.
    A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3760, CVE-2021-4202

    Lin Ma discovered race conditions in the NCI (NFC Controller
    Interface) driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-3772

    A flaw was found in the SCTP protocol implementation, which would
    allow a networked attacker to break an SCTP association.  The
    attacker would only need to know or guess the IP addresses and
    ports for the association.

CVE-2021-4002

    It was discovered that hugetlbfs, the virtual filesystem used by
    applications to allocate huge pages in RAM, did not flush the
    CPU's TLB in one case where it was necessary.  In some
    circumstances a local user would be able to read and write huge
    pages after they are freed and reallocated to a different process.
    This could lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or
    information leaks.

CVE-2021-4083

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    garbage collector, that can lead to use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-4135

    A flaw was found in the netdevsim driver which would lead to an
    information leak.

    This driver is not enabled in Debian's official kernel
    configurations.

CVE-2021-4155

    Kirill Tkhai discovered a data leak in the way the XFS_IOC_ALLOCSP
    IOCTL in the XFS filesystem allowed for a size increase of files
    with unaligned size. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to leak data on the XFS filesystem.

CVE-2021-4203

    Jann Horn reported a race condition in the local (Unix) sockets
    implementation that can lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this to leak sensitive information from the kernel.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22600

    The syzbot tool found a flaw in the packet socket (AF_PACKET)
    implementation which could lead to incorrectly freeing memory.  A
    local user with CAP_NET_RAW capability (in any user namespace)
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-28711, CVE-2021-28712, CVE-2021-28713 (XSA-391)

    Juergen Gross reported that malicious PV backends can cause a denial
    of service to guests being serviced by those backends via high
    frequency events, even if those backends are running in a less
    privileged environment.

CVE-2021-28714, CVE-2021-28715 (XSA-392)

    Juergen Gross discovered that Xen guests can force the Linux
    netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel memory, resulting in
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-38300

    Piotr Krysiuk discovered a flaw in the classic BPF (cBPF) JIT
    compiler for MIPS architectures.  A local user could exploit
    this to excute arbitrary code in the kernel.

    This issue is mitigated by setting sysctl
    net.core.bpf_jit_enable=0, which is the default.  It is *not*
    mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of eBPF.

CVE-2021-39685

    Szymon Heidrich discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    USB gadget subsystem, resulting in information disclosure, denial of
    service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39686

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could lead to incorrect security checks.  On systems where the
    binder driver is loaded, a local user could exploit this for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39698

    Linus Torvalds reported a flaw in the file polling implementation,
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user could exploit
    this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-39713

    The syzbot tool found a race condition in the network scheduling
    subsystem which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43975

    Brendan Dolan-Gavitt reported a flaw in the
    hw_atl_utils_fw_rpc_wait() function in the aQuantia AQtion ethernet
    device driver which can result in denial of service or the execution
    of arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-43976

    Zekun Shen and Brendan Dolan-Gavitt discovered a flaw in the
    mwifiex_usb_recv() function of the Marvell WiFi-Ex USB Driver. An
    attacker able to connect a crafted USB device can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-44733

    A race condition was discovered in the Trusted Execution
    Environment (TEE) subsystem for Arm processors, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  A local user permitted to access a TEE
    device could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption
    or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-45095

    It was discovered that the Phone Network protocol (PhoNet) driver
    has a reference count leak in the pep_sock_accept() function.

CVE-2021-45469

    Wenqing Liu reported an out-of-bounds memory access in the f2fs
    implementation if an inode has an invalid last xattr entry. An
    attacker able to mount a specially crafted image can take advantage
    of this flaw for denial of service.

CVE-2021-45480

    A memory leak flaw was discovered in the __rds_conn_create()
    function in the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) protocol subsystem.

CVE-2022-0001 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    Researchers at VUSec discovered that the Branch History Buffer in
    Intel processors can be exploited to create information side-
    channels with speculative execution.  This issue is similar to
    Spectre variant 2, but requires additional mitigations on some
    processors.

    This can be exploited to obtain sensitive information from a
    different security context, such as from user-space to the kernel,
    or from a KVM guest to the kernel.

CVE-2022-0002 (INTEL-SA-00598)

    This is a similar issue to CVE-2022-0001, but covers exploitation
    within a security context, such as from JIT-compiled code in a
    sandbox to hosting code in the same process.

    This can be partly mitigated by disabling eBPF for unprivileged
    users with the sysctl: kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=2.  This
    update does that by default.

CVE-2022-0322

    Eiichi Tsukata discovered a flaw in the sctp_make_strreset_req()
    function in the SCTP network protocol implementation which can
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-0330

    Sushma Venkatesh Reddy discovered a missing GPU TLB flush in the
    i915 driver, resulting in denial of service or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-0435

    Samuel Page and Eric Dumazet reported a stack overflow in the
    networking module for the Transparent Inter-Process Communication
    (TIPC) protocol, resulting in denial of service or potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2022-0487

    A use-after-free was discovered in the MOXART SD/MMC Host Controller
    support driver. This flaw does not impact the Debian binary packages
    as CONFIG_MMC_MOXART is not set.

CVE-2022-0492

    Yiqi Sun and Kevin Wang reported that the cgroup-v1 subsystem does
    not properly restrict access to the release-agent feature. A local
    user can take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation and
    bypass of namespace isolation.

CVE-2022-0617

    butt3rflyh4ck discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the UDF
    filesystem. A local user that can mount a specially crafted UDF
    image can use this flaw to crash the system.

CVE-2022-0644

    Hao Sun reported a missing check for file read permission in the
    finit_module() and kexec_file_load() system calls.  The security
    impact of this is unclear, since these system calls are usually
    only available to the root user.

CVE-2022-22942

    It was discovered that wrong file file descriptor handling in the
    VMware Virtual GPU driver (vmwgfx) could result in information leak
    or privilege escalation.

CVE-2022-24448

    Lyu Tao reported a flaw in the NFS implementation in the Linux
    kernel when handling requests to open a directory on a regular file,
    which could result in a information leak.

CVE-2022-24959

    A memory leak was discovered in the yam_siocdevprivate() function of
    the YAM driver for AX.25, which could result in denial of service.

CVE-2022-25258

    Szymon Heidrich reported the USB Gadget subsystem lacks certain
    validation of interface OS descriptor requests, resulting in memory
    corruption.

CVE-2022-25375

    Szymon Heidrich reported that the RNDIS USB gadget lacks validation
    of the size of the RNDIS_MSG_SET command, resulting in information
    leak from kernel memory.
