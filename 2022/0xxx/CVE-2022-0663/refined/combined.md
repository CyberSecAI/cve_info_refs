## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Print, PDF, Email by PrintFriendly < 5.2.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the Custom Button Text settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

In the plugin's settings, tick 'Custom Button' and put the following payload in the Text field: <img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the plugin's settings page, as well as all frontend pages

### Affects Plugins
