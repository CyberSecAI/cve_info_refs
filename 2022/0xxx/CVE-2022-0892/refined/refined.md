{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the CSV filename before outputting it back in the page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious CSV filename within a POST request to the plugin's settings page. The injected script executes when the filename is reflected back into the page.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable page. User interaction is required as the victim has to load the vulnerable page with the malicious input."
