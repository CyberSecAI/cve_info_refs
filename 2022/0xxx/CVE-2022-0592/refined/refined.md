- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and escape a parameter received via a REST endpoint before using it in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion, and potentially take complete control of the affected database.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable REST endpoint with a malicious payload injected into the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
