Based on the provided content, the commit `b7096af1028d8f909f63dd076d1bbd573913a92d` addresses missing permission checks and encoding issues in OrchardCore.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit message indicates "Fix missing permission checks and encoding." The code changes introduce authorization checks using `_authorizationService.AuthorizeAsync` in several controllers, suggesting the original code lacked proper access control mechanisms. Additionally, encoding issues might have been present (though the specific encoding fix isn't directly shown, it is mentioned in the commit message).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Missing authorization checks:** Several controllers lacked checks to verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform actions, such as viewing, editing, or disabling features. This could allow unauthorized users to access or modify content.
* **Potential Encoding Issues:** While not explicit in code diffs, the commit message mentions encoding, suggesting a lack of proper encoding could have led to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other injection-related issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Access and Modification:** Without proper permission checks, malicious users could potentially view or alter content they are not authorized to access. This could lead to data breaches, content tampering, and disruptions of services.
* **Potential XSS or Injection:** If encoding issues were present, they could be exploited to inject malicious scripts or code into the application, potentially compromising user accounts or other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
* **Directly accessing controller actions:** An attacker could try to directly access vulnerable controller actions (e.g., `Display`, `Edit`, `Disable`, `Enable`) without being authenticated or having the required permissions.
* **Manipulating input data:** If encoding issues are present, an attacker could inject malicious content through various input fields to exploit the lack of proper encoding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* **Network Access:** An attacker would require network access to the OrchardCore application.
* **Basic knowledge of the application:** The attacker would need to have some understanding of how the application works, specifically the areas related to content management, features, roles, and localization sets.
* **No special privileges (initially):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control. So, even an unauthorized user might be able to exploit the issues, without the need to obtain any higher privileges first.
