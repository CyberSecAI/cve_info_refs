- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NewStatPress plugin does not properly sanitize or escape the `whatX` parameters before outputting them in HTML attributes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they visit a crafted link. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in the `whatX` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL and trick a user into clicking on it. No special capabilities are required.
