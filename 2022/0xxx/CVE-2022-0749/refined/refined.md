Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-0749

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of untrusted data within the `SinGooCMS.Utility` package. Specifically, the `SocketClient` in the package uses the `BinaryFormatter` without proper restrictions, allowing an attacker to pass in a malicious payload through user-controllable input after a socket connection has been established.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502):** The application deserializes data from the socket client without sufficiently verifying its validity.
- **Use of `BinaryFormatter`:** The use of `BinaryFormatter` without type restrictions allows for arbitrary code execution by deserializing a crafted payload.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `SocketClient` does not implement necessary validation or type checking for the data received from the socket, making it susceptible to malicious input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a crafted serialized payload.
- **Total Loss of Integrity:** The attacker can modify files and data protected by the impacted component.
- **Total Loss of Availability:** The attacker can completely deny access to the resources.
- **Complete Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control over the affected system by exploiting the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. The attacker can connect to the vulnerable service using a socket and send a malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a socket connection with the server running the vulnerable code.
- The attacker needs to create a malicious payload that exploits the insecure deserialization process.
- No prior privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable `SocketClient.cs` file is located at: [https://github.com/SinGooCMS/SinGooCMSUtility/blob/master/SinGooCMS.Utility/Net/SocketClient.cs](https://github.com/SinGooCMS/SinGooCMSUtility/blob/master/SinGooCMS.Utility/Net/SocketClient.cs)
- The `ReceiveVarData` method is identified as the entry point for the vulnerability.
- The exploit requires constructing a specific payload format, including an 8-byte header that indicates the length of the serialized data.
- The payload is transmitted via a socket connection and deserialized using `BinaryFormatter`.

**Additional Notes:**
- There is no fixed version for the `SinGooCMS.Utility` package.
- The Snyk vulnerability ID for this issue is `SNYK-DOTNET-SINGOOCMSUTILITY-2312979`.
- The vulnerability was disclosed on 8 Dec 2021.
