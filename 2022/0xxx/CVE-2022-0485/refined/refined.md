  "CVE-2022-0485": {
    "description": "The vulnerability in libnbd's nbdcopy tool arises from a missing error check within the asynchronous copy mode. This can lead to corrupted destination images because `nbdcopy` does not verify the *error parameter upon completion of an asynchronous command, instead blindly treating the completion as successful. This lack of validation occurs during both read and write operations. \n\nSpecifically, when a read operation fails on the source, `nbdcopy` may write uninitialized memory (garbage data) or zeroed memory to the destination. Similarly, if a write operation to the destination fails, the tool won't report the issue, potentially leaving the destination image incompletely written. These issues can occur silently, causing data corruption without the user being aware of the failure since the tool exits with a zero return code. An attacker could exploit this by causing read or write operations to fail. This could lead to subtle data corruption within the affected images.",
