- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape various parameters before outputting them in certain pages, such as the user dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can then be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with unsanitized input in the `search` parameter, specifically when the victim user opens the user dashboard page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and trick a user to open the crafted URL, the user needs to be logged in.
