- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advanced Admin Search WordPress plugin fails to sanitize and escape specific parameters before outputting them on an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. When an administrator visits the crafted URL, the injected script will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions on the WordPress site with the administrator's privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code in the `keyword`, `user`, `metaKey`, or `metaValue` parameters. The attacker would need to entice an administrator to click on the crafted URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick an administrator into clicking the link. The attacker does not need any user credentials but needs the administrator to click on the crafted link.
