{
  "CVE-2022-0847": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper initialization of the \"flags\" member of the new pipe_buffer structure in the `copy_page_to_iter_pipe` and `push_pipe` functions within the Linux kernel.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `flags` member of the new pipe buffer structure is not initialized, potentially containing stale values from memory.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged local user can use this flaw to write to pages in the page cache backed by read-only files, thus escalating their privileges on the system.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An unprivileged local user is required to exploit the vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A flaw in the Linux kernel's pipe handling code, stemming from two bugs: one in Linux Kernel 4.9 related to page cache references and another introduced in Linux Kernel 5.8 related to merging anonymous pipe buffer operations.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The kernel fails to properly initialize the flags member of the new pipe buffer structure, allowing it to retain stale values. This enables an attacker to inject a mergeable flag into a page cache reference.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can overwrite any file they have read access to, leading to privilege escalation. This can be done by writing to a pipe which overwrites the page cache and not the file itself until the kernel is restarted.",
      "Attack vectors": "Local access.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs local access to exploit. Read permissions to the target file are necessary, and an offset that is not on a page boundary is required for exploitation."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The \"flags\" member of the new pipe buffer structure was not initialized properly in the copy_page_to_iter_pipe and push_pipe functions within the Linux kernel.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The 'flags' member of the new pipe buffer could contain stale values from memory. This allowed a user to manipulate the flags such that they can write data to pages in the page cache backed by read-only files.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An unprivileged local user could use this vulnerability to write to pages in the page cache backed by read-only files and escalate their privileges on the system.",
       "Attack vectors": "A local user exploiting a pipe's behavior to modify a page in the page cache.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user access with read permissions for the target file is required."
