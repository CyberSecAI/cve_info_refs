Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper access control check when listing video captions. Specifically, the `listVideoCaptions` function was using `res.locals.videoId.id` to fetch captions, which is the video ID without any additional checks, allowing unauthenticated users to potentially list captions of private videos, which were not supposed to be accessible without authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks before listing captions.
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to potentially access the captions of private videos, which could reveal sensitive or confidential information included in the captions.
- **Incorrect Context:** The code used `res.locals.videoId.id` which was not the intended video id for fetching captions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Private Captions:** An attacker could potentially list the captions of private videos that they are not authorized to view.
- **Information Leakage:** The content of the captions could be exposed, potentially revealing sensitive information about the video.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Request:**  An attacker could make an API request to the `/api/v1/videos/{videoId}/captions` endpoint without proper authentication to retrieve captions for a private video if they know the video ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Video ID:** The attacker needs to know the video ID of a private video.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability exists because the authorization checks were insufficient before the commit.

**Changes introduced by the commit:**

The commit addresses the vulnerability by making the following changes:

- In `server/controllers/api/videos/captions.ts`, the code changes `const data = await VideoCaptionModel.listVideoCaptions(res.locals.videoId.id)` to `const data = await VideoCaptionModel.listVideoCaptions(res.locals.onlyVideo.id)`. This ensures that the video id is obtained from the validated `onlyVideo` context, which enforces access control.
- In `server/middlewares/validators/videos/video-captions.ts`, the `listVideoCaptionsValidator` now includes a check using `checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate` to verify if the user is authorized to view the video before listing the captions.
- In `server/middlewares/validators/shared/videos.ts`, the function `checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate` was added to verify if the user can view the private video and the function `checkCanSeePrivateVideo` which performs the user authentication.
- In `server/tests/api/check-params/video-captions.ts` tests were added to check for the fix, that requests to list captions of private videos will fail without valid authentication.

These changes enforce proper access control, ensuring that only authorized users can list captions of private videos.
