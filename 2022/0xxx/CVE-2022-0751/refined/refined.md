Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The core issue is the GitLab web interface's failure to properly handle and display filenames containing non-printable ASCII characters. These characters, such as `\x90`, cause files to be hidden from the user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Inaccurate Information Display:** The web interface does not accurately represent the files present within a snippet, repository, or wiki when non-printable characters are used in filenames. It hides these files from view.
2.  **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** Attackers can create a symbolic link with a seemingly innocuous filename (e.g., `hello_world.sh`) that points to a file containing arbitrary commands (e.g., `\x90echo "Hello World"` containing `cat /etc/passwd`). The hidden file is not visible on the web UI.
3.  **Misleading Instructions:** Users are provided with instructions in a visible file (e.g., `instructions.txt`) that seem safe but, due to the hidden file and symbolic link, execute arbitrary commands on the user's system when followed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The most significant impact is the ability of an attacker to trick a victim into executing arbitrary system commands on their machine. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    *   Data theft (e.g., accessing `/etc/passwd` as shown in the example)
    *   Installation of malware
    *   System compromise
    *   Credential harvesting

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Git Snippets:** Attackers can create malicious snippets with hidden files and misleading instructions.
*   **Git Repositories:** Repositories can be poisoned with the same type of malicious files and symlinks.
*   **Git Wikis:** Wikis can also be used as a vehicle for this attack, however, it is noted that it results in 500 error on the web UI, making it less likely to be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **GitLab Account:** An attacker needs a GitLab account to create and push malicious snippets/repos/wikis.
2.  **Ability to Create Files with Non-Printable Characters:**  The attacker needs a system where they can create files with non-printable ASCII characters in the filename. The example given shows how to do this on Linux (`touch $'\x90'` or `touch `echo -e '\x90'``).
3.  **Knowledge of Git:** The attacker needs to be familiar with Git commands for cloning, adding files, creating symlinks, committing changes, and pushing to a remote repository.
4.  **Social Engineering:** Attackers will rely on users following instructions provided in a snippet, repo or wiki. The misleading aspect is that the hidden malicious file is not visible to the user on the Gitlab web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is reproducible on Linux and WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). It is not reproducible on macOS, since macOS does not allow for the creation of file names with special characters.
*   The provided materials include Proof-of-Concept videos demonstrating the exploit.
*   The HackerOne report indicates that the vulnerability was reported by `st4nly0n` and assigned to `@dcouture`.
*   The examples illustrate that this vulnerability impacts snippets, repositories, and wikis.
*   The fix should ensure that the web interface displays filenames with non-printable characters correctly and that users are not misled by hidden files.
