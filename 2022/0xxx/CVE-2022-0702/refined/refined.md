- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input in its settings fields before rendering them on the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings. These scripts will execute in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages, allowing the attacker to perform various malicious actions like redirecting users to phishing pages, stealing cookies or other sensitive data, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into any of the plugin's text field settings (e.g., 'Your Petfinder API Key v1.0').
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (Admin+) to access the plugin settings and inject the malicious payload.
