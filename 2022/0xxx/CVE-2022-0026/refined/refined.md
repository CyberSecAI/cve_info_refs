- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cortex XDR agent software on Windows has an issue that allows unintended program execution due to improper ownership management. Specifically, an authenticated local user with file creation privileges in the Windows root directory can create a specially crafted file that the agent will then execute with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Improper Ownership Management (CWE-282): The Cortex XDR agent does not properly manage the ownership of files it interacts with, leading to the possibility of executing arbitrary code placed in the root directory.
    - Local Privilege Escalation (PE): An attacker can leverage this flaw to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local user with limited privileges to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise. This includes gaining full control over the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - **LOCAL:** The attacker must have local access to the target system.
    - **File Creation Privilege in the Windows root directory:** The attacker needs the ability to create files in the root directory (e.g., C:\)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be an authenticated local user on the target system.
    - The attacker must have the privilege to create files in the Windows root directory.
