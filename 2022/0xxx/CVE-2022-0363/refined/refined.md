- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `mycred-tools-import-export` AJAX action in the myCred plugin lacks authorization and CSRF checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Missing authorization:** Any authenticated user, including subscribers with minimal privileges, can access and trigger the vulnerable AJAX action.
    - **Missing CSRF protection:** The AJAX action is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Arbitrary post creation: An attacker can create arbitrary posts by importing malicious data through the vulnerable AJAX action.
    - Plugin setup manipulation:  Attackers can import myCred setup data, potentially leading to the creation of badges and management of points in unintended ways.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Network: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
    - User access: Requires an authenticated user, even one with subscriber privileges, to make the request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have an account with subscriber or higher level privileges on the WordPress site.
    - They also need the ability to send a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
