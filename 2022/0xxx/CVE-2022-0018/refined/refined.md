- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GlobalProtect app, when Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled, unintentionally sends the local user account credentials to the GlobalProtect portal even when those credentials differ from the portal login credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Exposure (CWE-201) -  The app sends sensitive local user credentials to a potentially untrusted server (GlobalProtect portal).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of local user credentials to a GlobalProtect portal, potentially enabling unauthorized access or other malicious activities if the portal is compromised or controlled by a malicious actor.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. The vulnerability is triggered when a user connects to a GlobalProtect portal with SSO enabled using a vulnerable GlobalProtect app.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need a GlobalProtect portal to receive the credentials. They can't intercept credentials in transit (MITM attack is not possible), so the vulnerability is triggered if an attacker controls a GlobalProtect portal and a user connects to that malicious portal. The user must also use a vulnerable version of the GlobalProtect app.
