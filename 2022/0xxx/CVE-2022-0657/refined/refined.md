{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not properly sanitize, validate, and escape lead IDs before using them in a SQL statement via the `rrtngg_delete_leads` AJAX action.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input (`lead_ids`). The use of `sanitize_text_field()` is insufficient to prevent SQL injection.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. In this specific PoC, the attacker is able to cause a time-based blind injection.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the `rrtngg_delete_leads` AJAX action, accessible to unauthenticated users.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance. No authentication is required."
