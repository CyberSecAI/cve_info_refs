- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `html_element_selection` parameter is not sanitized and escaped before being output back into the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted URL or form submission with a malicious payload in the `html_element_selection` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or submitting a form containing the malicious payload. The user's browser will then execute the injected script.
