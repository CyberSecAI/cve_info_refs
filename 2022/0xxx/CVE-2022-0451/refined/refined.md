The provided content contains a fix for a vulnerability related to HTTP redirects in the Dart SDK. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `HttpClient` in Dart's `dart:io` library was previously forwarding sensitive headers (like `Authorization`, `WWW-Authenticate`, `Cookie`, and `Cookie2`) when following redirects, even to different domains.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Header Forwarding:**  The vulnerability was that sensitive authorization and cookie-related headers were being sent to a redirected URL, regardless of the domain. This is dangerous because it could allow a malicious server to capture these sensitive headers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Leakage:** An attacker could potentially set up a malicious redirect target to receive the sensitive headers from a client, such as authorization tokens, cookies, or other sensitive information, if the client makes a request that includes these headers.
- **Session Hijacking:** If cookies are leaked to a third party, it can potentially enable session hijacking.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Although not directly mentioned, a MitM attacker could potentially modify a redirect response in transit and inject their own malicious redirect URL.
- **Compromised Server:** An attacker could compromise a server and configure it to redirect requests to their malicious server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over the redirection target:** The attacker needs to control the server that receives the redirected request.
- **Able to cause a redirect:** The attacker needs a way to cause the vulnerable client to redirect (e.g., through a malicious redirect on a website).

**Fix:**
- The fix implements a check in `_shouldCopyHeaderOnRedirect` which will skip forwarding of `authorization`, `www-authenticate`, `cookie`, `cookie2` headers when the redirect target is not a subdomain or exact match of the original domain.
- The changes also include adding tests to verify that headers are handled correctly during redirects, including across domains and with different redirect codes.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes the commit diffs, showcasing the code changes made to address this vulnerability.
- The commit message and issue link confirm that this change was specifically made to fix the vulnerability described as the issue `45410`.
- The fix prevents sensitive headers from being sent cross-domain, mitigating the vulnerability.
