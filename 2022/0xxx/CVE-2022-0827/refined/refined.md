- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape specific parameters (`credit` and `debit`) before using them in a SQL statement via an AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially manipulate the SQL queries to access or modify data in the database. This could lead to data breaches, loss of data integrity, or even complete control of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed through the `admin-ajax.php` file, specifically when the `bestbooks_add_transaction` action is triggered via HTTP request. The attacker sends a crafted request including malicious SQL payload in the `credit` or `debit` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability and only needs network access to the affected server.
