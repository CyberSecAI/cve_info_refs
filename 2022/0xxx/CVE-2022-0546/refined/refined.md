Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-0546:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the image loader when parsing HDR image files. Specifically, the `imb_loadhdr` function in `radiance_hdr.c` does not validate the width and height parameters parsed from the image file using `sscanf`. This allows an attacker to specify negative values for width or height.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds heap access:**  Negative width or height values result in invalid memory address calculations.
*   **Missing Input Validation:** The lack of checks for negative width and height values allows for the creation of an `ImBuf` structure with invalid dimensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** The out-of-bounds access can lead to a crash.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  Writing to an invalid memory location could corrupt data.
*  **Potential Code Execution:** In some scenarios, the out-of-bounds write could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious HDR image file with a negative width or height.
*   The user needs to open or load the crafted HDR image in Blender

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious HDR image file.
* The attacker does not need access to the system other than the ability to get the user to open the crafted image file.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue was reported as Bug #94572 in the Blender project.
*   The vulnerability can occur in different parts of the code, depending on the flags set. IMB\_flipy() and IMB\_rect\_from\_float() are examples of vulnerable code paths.
*   The vulnerability was fixed with patch D11952.
* The issue affects multiple versions of Blender including 2.93.8 and 3.1.0
* The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2022-0546 by Red Hat CNA.
*   The fix involves adding checks for width and height right after parsing them with `sscanf` to prevent negative values.
