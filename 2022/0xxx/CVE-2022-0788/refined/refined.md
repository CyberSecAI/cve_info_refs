- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via one of its REST routes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to or modification of the database. This can result in data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service. The provided CVSS score of 8.6 indicates a high severity.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible through a REST route of the plugin. A specially crafted HTTP request with malicious SQL code is sent to the vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The vulnerability is unauthenticated, meaning an attacker does not need to have any account or privileges on the target WordPress system. They just need to send the crafted request.
