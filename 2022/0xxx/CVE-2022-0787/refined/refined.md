- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape parameters before using them in SQL statements via AJAX actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through AJAX actions available to unauthenticated users. Specifically, the `order` and `columns` parameters are vulnerable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
