The provided content is a commit diff from Github, not a CVE description. However, it shows a code change that relates to a potential vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code was not properly sanitizing user-provided input for custom property keys, specifically when adding a new property set.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:**  The original code used `customKey.getValue()` directly in `this.add`, without any escaping or sanitization, meaning that any character can be passed as the property key. This was later fixed by introducing `htmlspecialchars(customKey.getValue())`.
- **Potential for Injection:** Without proper sanitization, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code through the custom key, this would later be used as HTML content which might lead to a XSS vulnerability or cause unexpected behavior in the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the custom key, which would then execute in the context of other users' browsers when displayed in the application.
- **Application logic manipulation**: Although not specified, if the custom keys are later used to perform logic operations, this could allow an attacker to inject specific keys that could manipulate the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attacker would manipulate the "custom key" input field when adding a property to an element within the Pimcore application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to add custom properties to elements within Pimcore.

**Additional Information:**
- The commit diff shows that the vulnerability was addressed by applying `htmlspecialchars()` to the user input. This helps mitigate the potential XSS vulnerability by encoding HTML-specific characters.
- The vulnerability exists within `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/public/js/pimcore/element/properties.js`
