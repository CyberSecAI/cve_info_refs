- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings, which will then execute when a user views the plugin's settings page or any page/post where the plugin's shortcode is embedded.
- **Attack vectors:**  An authenticated user with administrative privileges can inject the malicious script by entering it into any of the plugin's text field settings (e.g., Title, Title font-size).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated WordPress user with high privileges, such as an administrator.
