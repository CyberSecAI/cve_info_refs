- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the Security Console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization or validation when processing filter queries using the "ALL" and "ANY" operators.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or manipulation of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** Manipulation of the "ALL" or "ANY" filter query operators within the Security Console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate filter queries within the Security Console.
