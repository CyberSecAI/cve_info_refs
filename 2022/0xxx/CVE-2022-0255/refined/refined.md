- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the `fragment` parameter before using it in a SQL query within the admin dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI), specifically in the handling of the `fragment` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration or modification. In this specific case, the PoC shows how to extract database user information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious `fragment` parameter within a GET request to the WordPress admin interface, specifically targeting the `tools.php` page of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator. They also need to obtain a valid nonce, which can be found in the HTML source of the plugin settings page within the admin dashboard.
