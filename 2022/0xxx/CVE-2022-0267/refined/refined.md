- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `adrotate_action` parameter is not sanitized or escaped before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLI).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with administrator privileges can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or complete control of the database.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin/` with a malicious `adrotate_action` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator on the WordPress site.
