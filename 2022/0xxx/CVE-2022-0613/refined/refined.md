Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the `URI.js` library handles the parsing of URLs, specifically related to the scheme (protocol) part of the URL. The library was not performing case-insensitive matching of the scheme when stripping slashes/backslashes, which led to unexpected behavior when a URL with mixed-case scheme was provided.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Case-sensitive scheme parsing:** The original code used a regular expression `^(https?|ftp|wss?)?:[/\\]\*` to strip slashes/backslashes, which was case-sensitive in matching the scheme (e.g., `http`, `ftp`, `wss`).
- **Authorization Bypass:** By providing a URL with a mixed-case scheme (e.g., `hTTps`), an attacker could potentially bypass expected authorization checks which relied on the normalized scheme.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authorization bypass:** By crafting a URL with a non-standard scheme, an attacker could potentially bypass checks that rely on scheme normalization, potentially leading to unauthorized access or actions.
- The specific impact would be dependent on the application utilizing the vulnerable `URI.js` library.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a mixed-case scheme.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide or influence the input to a system using the vulnerable version of `URI.js`.
- They don't need any special privileges and can be positioned remotely.

**Technical Details**

- The vulnerability was fixed by changing the regular expression to `^(https?|ftp|wss?)?:[/\\]\*/i`, which makes the scheme matching case-insensitive using the `i` flag.
- A new test case was added to check for this specific issue, named 'excessive slash protocol https case-insensitive' with URL `hTTps://////attacker.com`.

**Additional Notes**
