Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `$ids` array before being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the `implode(',', $ids)` function was directly inserting the array elements into the SQL query without verifying that they were indeed integers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. By manipulating the `$ids` array, an attacker could insert malicious SQL code into the query, potentially leading to unauthorized access or modification of the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Breach: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
- Data Manipulation: The attacker could modify or delete data within the database.
- Denial of Service: A successful exploit could potentially disrupt the application's functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `deleteData` function in the `src/Backend/Modules/FormBuilder/Engine/Model.php` file.
- An attacker could manipulate the `$ids` array being passed to the `deleteData` function, specifically the `forms_data` and `forms_data_fields` SQL delete statements.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to influence the `$ids` array that gets passed to the `deleteData` function.
- This may require some level of access to the application or a way to craft the parameters that would lead to an exploit of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit diff shows the addition of `array_map('intval', $ids)` before the implode function. This is the fix that mitigates the SQL injection vulnerability, as it ensures that all elements in the `$ids` array are converted to integers.
- The commit message "Prevent sql injection through the ids of the action" confirms the vulnerability and the fix implemented.
