Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The SiteSuperCharger plugin fails to properly validate, sanitize, and escape user-supplied inputs before using them in SQL queries. This occurs specifically through AJAX actions that are accessible to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection (SQLi).
*  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can perform arbitrary SQL queries against the database, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or complete compromise of the database. The CVSS score indicates high severity with confidentiality impact as high.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable via HTTP requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely, by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Technical Details:**

The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates an SQL injection using the following curl request:
```
curl https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php --data '0=images+UNION+SELECT+1+from+wp\_users+WHERE+1+%3d+(SELECT+SLEEP(1))+--+&1=.&action=processGroup'
```

This request targets the `processGroup` AJAX action, injecting malicious SQL code through the `0` parameter. The payload `UNION+SELECT+1+from+wp_users+WHERE+1+%3d+(SELECT+SLEEP(1))` attempts to retrieve user data from the `wp_users` table and causes a time-based delay via `SLEEP(1)`, which is a typical method for detecting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.2.0 of the plugin.
