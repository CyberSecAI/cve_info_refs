Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0371:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from GitLab allowing users to be searched by their exact private email address through the API (GraphQL and REST) and potentially the UI, even when the email is not publicly exposed on their profile.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Private email addresses, intended to be hidden, can be used to identify user profiles.
*   **Insecure Search Functionality:** The search functionality does not properly respect user privacy settings, specifically regarding email visibility.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **User enumeration:** Attackers can use lists of potential email addresses to find active user profiles on GitLab.com.
*   **Privacy breach:** By finding profiles with private emails, attackers can potentially associate those emails with public profile information.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **API Abuse:** Attackers can use GraphQL or REST API requests to search for users by exact email address.
*  **UI search:** Although not explicitly stated, the vulnerability may be present in the UI search as well.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a list of potential email addresses.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the GitLab API or interact with the UI.

**Additional Notes**
