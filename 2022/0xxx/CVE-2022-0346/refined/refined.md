The provided content relates to CVE-2022-0346.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly validate the `xsg-provider` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to the lack of sanitization of the `xsg-provider` parameter.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability if `allow_url_include` is enabled on the server, due to the ability to pass `data://` URLs to the `xsg-provider` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the webpage, potentially leading to:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website.
- **RCE:** If `allow_url_include` is enabled, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to:
    - Full control of the server.
    - Data breaches.
    - Malware installation.
    - Website defacement.

**Attack vectors:**
- The XSS attack vector is through a crafted URL using the vulnerable `xsg-provider` parameter.
- The RCE attack vector is through a crafted URL using the `xsg-provider` parameter and a `data://` URL to include and execute arbitrary code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious URL and convincing a user to click on it (XSS) or directly accessing the URL (RCE). No special privileges or prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable plugin is "Google XML Sitemap Generator" versions prior to 2.0.4.
- The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c.
- The CVSS score is 6.1 (medium) with the vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N`.
