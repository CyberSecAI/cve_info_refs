- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate the `id` parameter before redirecting the user, via the `kc_get_thumbn` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect vulnerability due to the lack of input validation on the `id` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect users to an arbitrary website by manipulating the `id` parameter in the `kc_get_thumbn` AJAX action. This could be used for phishing attacks or other malicious purposes.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifying the `action=kc_get_thumbn` and an arbitrary URL in the `id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No specific capabilities or position is required. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely and without authentication, as the `kc_get_thumbn` AJAX action is available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.
