{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `post_type` parameter before outputting it back in an admin page.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `post_type` parameter, an attacker can trigger the XSS vulnerability when a victim (typically an admin user) visits the crafted URL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and lure a victim (typically an admin user) to click on the link."
