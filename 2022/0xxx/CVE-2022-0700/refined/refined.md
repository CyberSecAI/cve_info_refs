- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Simple Theme Options plugin does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with high privileges, like an admin, can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the Theme Customizer page. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be a high privilege user (such as admin) and can inject the malicious payload via any textarea field settings of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access the plugin's settings. They do not need to be on the same network as the victim. The attacker must also be able to access the WordPress admin panel and navigate to the relevant plugin settings.
