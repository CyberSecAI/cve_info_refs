The provided content is related to a commit that introduces a Content Security Policy (CSP) handler to Pimcore. This commit itself does not introduce a vulnerability. It enhances the security of the application. The commit adds functionality to allow the configuration of CSP headers, including the ability to specify allowed URLs for various resource types (scripts, styles, images, etc.) which is a standard security practice.

Here's a breakdown of the changes and their relevance:

**Key Changes and Functionality:**

*   **`ContentSecurityPolicyHandler` Class:** A new class `ContentSecurityPolicyHandler` is introduced to manage the generation of CSP headers. It allows for setting allowed sources for various resources like scripts, images, styles, etc.
*   **Configuration:** The changes add configuration options in `Configuration.php` that allow the admin to enable/disable CSP headers and add additional URLs to the CSP policy.
*   **Event Listener:** An `AdminSecurityListener` is added to set the CSP header on admin responses if configured.
*   **Compiler Pass:** A `ContentSecurityPolicyUrlsPass` compiler pass is included to inject configured URLs into `ContentSecurityPolicyHandler`.
*   **Nonce:** The commit also introduces a nonce mechanism for inline scripts to comply with CSP requirements.
*   **Preview fix:** An issue with the document preview is fixed related to the CSP implementation.

**Security Impact:**

*   The core functionality added by this commit is to enhance the security posture of the Pimcore application by preventing common web attacks like XSS by enforcing a restrictive Content Security Policy.
*   The configuration options allow for the customization of the policy.
*   By setting CSP, the application is less vulnerable to injection of malicious scripts or other resources.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** There is no vulnerability introduced in this commit. The purpose of this commit is to improve security by adding CSP support.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** No vulnerabilities were introduced; instead, security was enhanced.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Not applicable. The code aims to mitigate XSS and similar vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack vectors:** Not applicable. The code aims to protect against attacks.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Not applicable. The code is a security improvement.

**Summary:**

The provided content does not indicate any vulnerability related to CVE-2022-0894. The commit is implementing a security feature which is designed to protect the application from attacks by setting a Content Security Policy. Therefore, the content is **UNRELATED** to a vulnerability.
