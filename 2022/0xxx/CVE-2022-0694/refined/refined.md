Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly validate and sanitize the `calendar` parameter before using it in a SQL query. This parameter is supplied via the `abc_booking_getSingleCalendar` AJAX action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary weakness is the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability. By manipulating the `calendar` parameter, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database compromise:** While the provided exploit uses a `SLEEP()` function for timing, an attacker could leverage this SQL injection to:
    *   Extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modify database records.
    *   Potentially gain further access to the server depending on database configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the WordPress admin-ajax.php endpoint.
*   **AJAX Action:** The specific AJAX action that is vulnerable is `abc_booking_getSingleCalendar`.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `calendar`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be logged into WordPress to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter:** The attacker must know about the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, the `abc_booking_getSingleCalendar` action, and the `calendar` parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided proof of concept shows how to induce a 5-second delay in the database response, a technique that is often used to confirm a blind SQL injection.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.7.0 of the plugin.

**Summary**

The `Advanced Booking Calendar` WordPress plugin had an unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability due to a lack of sanitization of the `calendar` parameter in the `abc_booking_getSingleCalendar` AJAX action. This vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries against the site's database.
