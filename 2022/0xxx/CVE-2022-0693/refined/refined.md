- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `meta_ids` parameter in the `remove_post_meta_condition` AJAX action is not validated or escaped before being used in a SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP GET request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint, by crafting a malicious payload in the `meta_ids` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely and requires no special user privileges.
