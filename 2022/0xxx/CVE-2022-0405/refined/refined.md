The provided content is a commit diff for a Calibre-web project, specifically addressing issue #1990. The commit focuses on changes related to Kobo sync token generation and handling, particularly when accessed from localhost. This commit does not seem related to any specific vulnerability mentioned in the CVE description.

The key changes introduced in the commit are:

1. **Kobo Sync Token Generation from Localhost:** The code now allows the creation of a Kobo sync token even when Calibre-web is accessed from localhost. Previously, this was blocked, requiring a non-localhost access to get a valid API endpoint for the Kobo device.
2. **"Unclicking" Create Token Button:** The "create kobo sync token" button is now reset (unclicked) after the dialog box is closed.
3. **Localhost Route Handling:** An additional route for localhost access is now handled.
4. **Book Format Deletion Logic:** When a book format is deleted, the code also removes the book's synced-to-Kobo status.

Based on these changes, the content is related to bug fixing and feature enhancement for Kobo integration and does not introduce or patch a security vulnerability described in CVE-2022-0405 (placeholder description).

Therefore, the response is:

**UNRELATED**
