The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2022-0230.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin `Better WordPress Google XML Sitemaps` does not sanitize and escape its logs when outputting them in the admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper sanitization and escaping of log entries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the context of a logged-in administrator's browser when they view the plugin's log dashboard. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, and other forms of unauthorized access or control.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject a malicious script by sending a crafted `bwpsitemap` parameter via a GET request. When the administrator views the logs, the injected script is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated. They only need to send a crafted request to the vulnerable server.
- They need to be able to access the website with the vulnerable plugin installed.
- The targeted user needs to view the admin dashboard of the plugin to trigger the XSS.

The vulnerability is present in the plugin versions `<= 1.4.1`.
