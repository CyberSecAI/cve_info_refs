- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `error_message` parameter before including it in the response of the `jltma_restrict_content` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the response which will be executed in the victim's browser, leading to potential cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the action set to `jltma_restrict_content` and a malicious payload in the `error_message` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated and can send the malicious request to the target WordPress site. User interaction is required as the victim must visit a link or submit the crafted form.
