## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# YOP Poll < 6.3.5 - Author+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape some of the settings (available to users with a role as low as author) before outputting them, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue

### Proof of Concept

As author, put the following payload in the Settings > Integration > Use Google reCaptcha (Yes) > Site Key:
v < 6.3.3 - "><svg/onload=alert(/XSS/)>
v < 6.3.5 - " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when any authorised user (such as another author, or admin) adds/edit a Poll
