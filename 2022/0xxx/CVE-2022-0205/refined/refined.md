- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape some settings before outputting them, specifically within the "Use Google reCaptcha" setting. This lack of sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other authorized users (such as other authors or admins) when they add or edit a poll. This could allow the attacker to perform various actions, including stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on the website with the user's privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the "Settings > Integration > Use Google reCaptcha (Yes) > Site Key" setting within the plugin's configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have at least the "author" role to modify the plugin settings.
