- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `order_pos` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page, potentially leading to actions performed on behalf of the administrator, cookie theft, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter (`order_pos`) containing a script, and tricking an administrator into accessing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to convince an administrator to click the crafted URL, which could be sent via email, embedded on a malicious site, etc.
