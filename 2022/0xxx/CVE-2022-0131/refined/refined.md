- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Jimoty App for Android uses a hard-coded API key for an external service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application has a hard-coded API key, which is a [CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can obtain the API key by analyzing the app's data. This could allow an attacker to potentially abuse the external service associated with the key. The specific impact of abusing the service is not detailed.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is local to the device where the app is installed. The attacker needs to analyze the app's data to extract the API key.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the Jimoty app's data, meaning they would likely need to have the application installed or the ability to obtain it. They must be able to perform static analysis on the application.
