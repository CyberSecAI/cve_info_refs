- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `tab` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin page, potentially leading to actions such as stealing session cookies, performing actions on behalf of the admin, or redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `tab` parameter and lures an administrator to visit this link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince an administrator to visit it.
