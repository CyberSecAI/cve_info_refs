The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities resolved in Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows, particularly in the November 2021 release and its subsequent patches. However, there is no specific information about a vulnerability with the identifier CVE-2022-0564.

Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of several vulnerabilities that were addressed in Qlik Sense, though it's important to note that none of them are explicitly identified as CVE-2022-0564.

**1. HTTP Tunneling vulnerability** (QB-21222):
   - **Root Cause:**  A critical HTTP Tunneling vulnerability was present in Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows.
   - **Vulnerability:** Improper handling of HTTP requests allowed for tunneling.
   - **Impact:** Not specified
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious HTTP requests.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Qlik Sense server.

**2. Path traversal vulnerability** (QB-21220):
   - **Root Cause:** A high-severity path traversal vulnerability existed in Qlik Sense Enterprise for Windows.
   - **Vulnerability:** Improper validation of file paths.
   - **Impact:** Not specified
   - **Attack Vector:** Malicious file paths
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker would need to be able to influence file paths used by Qlik Sense.

**3. Proxy web cache poisoning** (QB-21561):
   - **Root Cause:** The Qlik Sense Proxy was vulnerable to web cache poisoning.
   - **Vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of cached content.
   - **Impact:** Could potentially lead to serving incorrect or malicious content to users.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Crafted requests to poison the web cache
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Qlik Sense proxy and potentially influence the cached content.

**4. Improved HTTP Request validation** (QB-21437):
   - **Root Cause:** Insufficient validation logic when processing HTTP Request bodies.
   - **Vulnerability:** Lack of proper input sanitization.
   - **Impact:** Could lead to various issues depending on how the data is subsequently processed.
   - **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted HTTP request bodies.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the Qlik Sense server.

**5. Added validation to X-Qlik-\* HTTP headers** (QB-21731):
   - **Root Cause:** Lack of validation for custom HTTP headers used by Qlik.
   - **Vulnerability:**  Improperly formatted or malicious `X-Qlik-*` headers.
    -   **Impact:** could lead to various issues, potentially injection vulnerabilities if the header is used insecurely.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending malicious HTTP requests with crafted `X-Qlik-*` headers.
   -  **Attacker Capabilities**: Attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Qlik Sense server.

**6. Improved validation of Transfer-Encoding Headers** (QB-21683):
   - **Root Cause:** Inadequate validation of Transfer-Encoding headers.
   - **Vulnerability:** Improperly formatted or malicious Transfer-Encoding headers.
   - **Impact:** Could lead to various issues, like HTTP request smuggling.
   - **Attack Vector:**  Sending malicious HTTP requests with crafted Transfer-Encoding headers.
   - **Attacker Capabilities**: Attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Qlik Sense server.

**7. Information disclosure of internal FQDN and ports** (QB-9454, QB-9795):
   - **Root Cause:**  Error messages returned detailed internal URLs and ports.
   - **Vulnerability:**  Exposing internal system information in error messages.
   - **Impact:**  Attackers could use this information to better plan attacks on the internal network.
   - **Attack Vector:** Sending requests to non-existent URLs.
   - **Attacker Capabilities:**  An attacker simply needs to send requests to the server and be able to receive the response.

**8. Host header validation issue** (QB-7782):
   -  **Root Cause**: Improper validation of the HTTP Host header when Qlik Sense hostname is in the 'Host allow list'.
    -  **Vulnerability**: Insecure handling of the host header
   - **Impact**: Could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions and potentially exploit other vulnerabilities
   - **Attack Vector**: Sending requests with a malicious host header
    -  **Attacker Capabilities**: Attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Qlik Sense proxy.

**9. Node.js Vulnerabilities** (QB-16853, SHEND-1011, SHEND-663)
   - **Root Cause**: Vulnerabilities in the included Node.js version.
    -  **Vulnerability**: Third party vulnerability in Node.js
   - **Impact**: Varies depending on the Node.js vulnerability.
   - **Attack Vector**: Varies depending on the Node.js vulnerability.
   - **Attacker Capabilities**: Varies depending on the Node.js vulnerability.

**10. Other fixes:** Numerous other issues were resolved, including data loading problems with various connectors, issues with visualizations, problems with authentication (SAML, OIDC), and performance issues. While these fixes are important for stability and usability, they do not relate to the specified CVE.

**Conclusion:**

The provided documents do not contain any information about CVE-2022-0564. However, they detail several security vulnerabilities that were addressed in Qlik Sense Enterprise on Windows, including HTTP tunneling, path traversal, web cache poisoning, and vulnerabilities in underlying libraries like Node.js.
