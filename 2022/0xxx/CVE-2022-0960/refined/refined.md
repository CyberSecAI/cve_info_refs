The provided content includes a commit diff from a GitHub repository and a footer from huntr.dev. The commit diff focuses on changes made to the allowed file extensions within `AttachmentModel.class.php`.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The commit modifies the `isAllowedFilename` function by adding and removing specific file extensions. While this commit itself might not be a vulnerability, it highlights the importance of carefully managing allowed file extensions to prevent potential security issues like arbitrary file upload. The changes are meant to restrict allowed file extensions for uploads. The vulnerability would be if the allowed file extensions list was not restrictive enough.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

The primary weakness here lies in the file extension filtering logic, where an overly permissive list of allowed file extensions could be present in previous versions. This could potentially allow the upload of malicious files that could be interpreted as executable code by the server or browser, if any of the allowed extensions were not safe. Although the diff shows a change that makes the allowed extensions more restrictive, this commit does not introduce a new vulnerability, it fixes an existing one if the previous version was insecure.

**Impact of exploitation:**

If an attacker could upload a malicious file using an allowed extension, they could potentially achieve the following:

*   **Remote Code Execution:** If the server attempts to execute the uploaded file directly or indirectly.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the file contains Javascript or HTML, it could be served by the server, and execute on the user's browser.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Uploading large malicious files to exhaust server resources.
*   **Data theft**: Uploading files that can exfiltrate server data.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is file upload functionality present in the application, where the attacker attempts to upload malicious files disguised as allowed extensions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker would need to have access to the file upload function.

**Summary:**

While the provided content doesn't describe an active exploit of CVE-2022-0960, it focuses on a commit that addresses a vulnerability present in the `AttachmentModel.class.php` file of the `showdoc` repository on GitHub. The vulnerability was related to an insufficiently restrictive file extension allow list.
