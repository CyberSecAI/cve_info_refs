Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-0471

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape the `json_result_url` parameter before displaying it in the Favicon admin dashboard.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the `json_result_url` parameter.
*   When an administrator visits the Favicon admin dashboard, this malicious script is executed in their browser.
*   This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the administrator, such as stealing session cookies, modifying content, or redirecting users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `json_result_url` parameter in the URL.
*   An attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious script in the parameter and trick a logged-in administrator to click the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted URL.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to click the malicious link.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is in `admin/class-favicon-by-realfavicongenerator-admin.php`. The fix involves applying `FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS` after `FILTER_SANITIZE_URL` to the `$_REQUEST['json_result_url']` parameter.
Before the fix:
```php
$new_favicon_params_url = filter_var ( $_REQUEST['json_result_url'], FILTER_SANITIZE_URL );
```
After the fix:
```php
$new_favicon_params_url = filter_var(
  filter_var( $_REQUEST['json_result_url'], FILTER_SANITIZE_URL ),
  FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS
);
```

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerable plugin is "Favicon by RealFaviconGenerator"
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.23 of the plugin.
* The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to inject a script into the `json_result_url` parameter:
