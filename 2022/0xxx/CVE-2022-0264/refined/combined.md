bpf: Fix kernel address leakage in atomic fetchThe change in commit 37086bfdc737 ("bpf: Propagate stack bounds to registers
in atomics w/ BPF\_FETCH") around check\_mem\_access() handling is buggy since
this would allow for unprivileged users to leak kernel pointers. For example,
an atomic fetch/and with -1 on a stack destination which holds a spilled
pointer will migrate the spilled register type into a scalar, which can then
be exported out of the program (since scalar != pointer) by dumping it into
a map value.
The original implementation of XADD was preventing this situation by using
a double call to check\_mem\_access() one with BPF\_READ and a subsequent one
with BPF\_WRITE, in both cases passing -1 as a placeholder value instead of
register as per XADD semantics since it didn't contain a value fetch. The
BPF\_READ also included a check in check\_stack\_read\_fixed\_off() which rejects
the program if the stack slot is of \_\_is\_pointer\_value() if dst\_regno < 0.
The latter is to distinguish whether we're dealing with a regular stack spill/
fill or some arithmetical operation which is disallowed on non-scalars, see
also 6e7e63cbb023 ("bpf: Forbid XADD on spilled pointers for unprivileged
users") for more context on check\_mem\_access() and its handling of placeholder
value -1.
One minimally intrusive option to fix the leak is for the BPF\_FETCH case to
initially check the BPF\_READ case via check\_mem\_access() with -1 as register,
followed by the actual load case with non-negative load\_reg to propagate
stack bounds to registers.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2041547#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2022-01-17 16:51:37 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. There is an address leakage in BPF atomic fetch.  This allows a local user with the ability to insert EBPF rules to be able to gather additional information for further attacks on the kernel.  Reference and upstream patch: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/commit/?id=7d3baf0afa3aa9102d6a521a8e4c41888bb79882>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2041547#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2022-01-17 16:52:58 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2041548](show_bug.cgi?id=2041548 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2022-0264 kernel: address leakage in BPF atomic fetch [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2041547#c2)  Justin M. Forbes    2022-01-17 22:18:10 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 5.15.11 stable kernel updates.   ``` |  |
