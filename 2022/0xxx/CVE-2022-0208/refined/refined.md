- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `mapid` parameter before outputting it in the "Bad mapid" error message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page viewed by a user. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a specific payload in the `mapid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a user to click on the malicious URL.
