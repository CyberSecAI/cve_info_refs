### Description

A vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that enables an authenticated network-based PAN-OS administrator to upload a specifically created configuration that disrupts system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges when the configuration is committed on both hardware and virtual firewalls.

This issue does not impact Panorama appliances or Prisma Access customers.

This issue impacts:

PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.23;

PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.16;

PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.13;

PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.10;

PAN-OS 10.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.1.5.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 10.2 | None | >= 10.2.0 |
| PAN-OS 10.1 | < 10.1.5 | >= 10.1.5 |
| PAN-OS 10.0 | < 10.0.10 | >= 10.0.10 |
| PAN-OS 9.1 | < 9.1.13 | >= 9.1.13 |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | < 9.0.16 | >= 9.0.16 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | < 8.1.23 | >= 8.1.23 |

### Severity: HIGH

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
7.2 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Exploitation Status

Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this issue.

### Weakness Type

[CWE-138 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/138 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/138")

### Solution

This issue is fixed in PAN-OS 8.1.23, PAN-OS 9.0.16, PAN-OS 9.1.13, PAN-OS 10.0.10, PAN-OS 10.1.5, and all later PAN-OS versions.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

This issue requires the attacker to have authenticated access to the PAN-OS management interface. You can mitigate the impact of this issue by following best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS technical documentation at <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/best-practices>.
