- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of special elements. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the handling of a specially crafted configuration file during the commit process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper neutralization of special elements, leading to unintended program execution and potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can disrupt system processes and potentially lead to arbitrary code execution with root privileges on both hardware and virtual firewalls. This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack. An authenticated PAN-OS administrator can upload a malicious configuration.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated administrator with network access to the PAN-OS management interface.
