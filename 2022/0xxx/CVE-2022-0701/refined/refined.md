- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly escape the Request and Destination settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings that will execute when a user views the affected pages. This can lead to various malicious activities like session hijacking, account compromise or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to be an admin user or a user with high privileges and needs to inject malicious script into the "Request" or "Destination" settings of the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have administrative or high-level privileges on the WordPress site.
