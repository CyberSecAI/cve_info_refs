Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the commit related to CVE-2022-0956:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit `56e450c3adf75c707500d7231a78c9fc894c7f13` addresses a "file upload bug" in `AttachmentModel.class.php`. The specific change involves modifying the allowed file extensions list by removing `.ofd`, `.swf`, and `.epub` from the allowed extensions, and also by removing a duplicate `.ppt`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability likely stemmed from allowing the upload of file types (.ofd, .swf and .epub) that could be exploited due to their potential for containing malicious code or being parsed in a vulnerable way, or a vulnerability caused by the duplicate file extension. By removing these extensions from the allowed list, the application is made more secure from this type of vulnerability. This indicates an unrestricted file upload vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
By uploading files of the removed filetypes, an attacker might have been able to execute arbitrary code on the server or achieve other malicious impacts.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the file upload functionality within the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to have the ability to upload files to the application.

**Additional Notes**
* The commit message "file upload bug" and the code change in `AttachmentModel.class.php` confirm that the identified vulnerability is related to an insecure file upload.
* The removal of specific extensions suggests that these extensions were likely found to be a security risk, which was fixed by limiting the allowed file types.
* The commit does not provide details of the vulnerability, such as if it was a specific vulnerability within these file formats or if it was an improper filtering or lack of sanitization of the files once uploaded.

The commit itself is a fix for the file upload vulnerability, not the vulnerability itself.
