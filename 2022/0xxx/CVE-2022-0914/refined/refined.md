- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Export All URLs WordPress plugin lacks CSRF protection when exporting data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to export all posts and pages (including private and draft ones) into an arbitrary CSV file. The attacker can then download the file and retrieve sensitive information like post/page titles.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that, when opened by a logged-in administrator, triggers the export functionality in the plugin. This is achieved via a CSRF attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into opening a malicious web page containing the crafted form.
