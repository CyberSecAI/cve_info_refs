- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of exceptional conditions in the DNS proxy feature of PAN-OS software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability exists due to the software's inability to properly handle exceptional conditions when processing specifically crafted network traffic.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause the DNS proxy service to restart unexpectedly. Repeated attempts can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) by forcing the device into maintenance mode, thereby disrupting all PAN-OS services.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is conducted over the network by sending specifically crafted traffic to the firewall's DNS proxy feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to send network traffic to the firewall, and no specific user interaction or privileges are required. The attack complexity is rated as high, which suggests that crafting the specific traffic may be non-trivial.
