- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin fails to sanitize and escape user-supplied POST data before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. Although the CVSS score indicates no impact on integrity or availability, successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX action available to unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint. The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX action name and the parameter names to inject the malicious SQL payload. The provided curl command demonstrates the injection.
