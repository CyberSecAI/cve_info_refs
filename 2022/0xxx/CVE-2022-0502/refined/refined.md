The provided content is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, which appears to be related to the Live Helper Chat project. The commit modifies two template files, `cannedmsgform.tpl.php` and `canned_messages.tpl.php`. These changes involve the addition of `ng-non-bindable` attributes to textarea elements.

Based on the provided context, this commit seems to address a potential vulnerability related to how AngularJS processes the content within these textareas. Specifically, AngularJS might attempt to interpret the content of these textareas as AngularJS expressions, leading to unintended code execution or information leakage if user-supplied content contains malicious AngularJS expressions. The `ng-non-bindable` attribute prevents AngularJS from interpreting the textarea content, mitigating this risk.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- AngularJS expression injection vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Potential for AngularJS to interpret and execute user-supplied content within textarea fields as AngularJS expressions

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Unintended code execution or information leakage if malicious AngularJS expressions are injected via the textarea input.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Attacker could inject malicious AngularJS expressions into textarea fields (Message or FallbackMessage) that are part of the canned message functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would likely need to have the ability to create, edit, or modify canned messages that contain malicious payloads.

In summary, the commit addresses a potential AngularJS injection vulnerability. The `ng-non-bindable` attribute added to the textarea elements effectively mitigates this vulnerability. This commit is related to a potential vulnerability.
