The provided content is a commit diff from the HestiaCP project. It replaces `.html()` with `.text()` in several JavaScript files and templates. This change is to avoid potential issues related to rendering HTML content, aiming for a safer approach by treating the content as plain text.

Here's a breakdown of the changes:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability (if applicable):**

While the commit diff itself doesn't describe a specific vulnerability, the change from `.html()` to `.text()` suggests a potential concern about how user-controlled data might be handled. Specifically, if user-provided input was being passed to `.html()`, it could be interpreted as HTML and execute malicious code (XSS vulnerability). By switching to `.text()`, the content is treated as plain text, preventing this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The weakness being addressed is a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that could arise from using `.html()` to display potentially user-controlled strings. This type of vulnerability is common where user input is not properly sanitized before being displayed on a webpage.

**Impact of Exploitation (if applicable):**

If a malicious user were able to inject HTML through the fields where `.html()` was used, they could potentially:
* Redirect users to malicious websites.
* Steal user cookies and session tokens.
* Deface or modify the website content.
* Execute malicious JavaScript on the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors (if applicable):**

The attack vector would involve a malicious user injecting HTML code through input fields. For instance, if an attacker could enter malicious HTML in a database name or username, this code could be executed when that field is displayed using `.html()`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

* The attacker would need to have the ability to input and save malicious HTML content in the relevant fields of the application (database names, usernames, DNS records, email accounts, web settings, etc).
* Depending on the vulnerability location, the attacker might need to be logged in to the application with the appropriate privileges.

**Summary:**

The commit addresses a potential XSS vulnerability by switching from `.html()` to `.text()` in several JavaScript files and HTML templates. This change mitigates a potential risk where unsanitized user input displayed on the page could be interpreted as HTML and lead to a security exploit. The diff provides more details than a standard CVE description, explaining the actual code changes made to fix the underlying potential vulnerability.
