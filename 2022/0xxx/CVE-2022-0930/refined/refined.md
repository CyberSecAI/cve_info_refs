Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient file type validation during file uploads. Specifically, the `plupload.php` function was not properly checking if the uploaded file's extension was allowed. Previously, it only checked for "dangerous" extensions, but not explicitly for allowed ones, leading to potential bypasses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate File Extension Validation:** The initial code only focused on blocking dangerous extensions, not explicitly allowing only specific extensions for upload. This created a loophole where a malicious file with a non-dangerous but still unwanted extension could be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker could upload files with extensions that are not intended for the system. This could lead to:
  - **Code Execution:** If a malicious file with a permitted extension like ".php", or an unexpected/unhandled extension that is later processed and executed by the server, is uploaded, it could potentially lead to remote code execution on the server.
  - **Data Exfiltration:** If the server has vulnerabilities related to accessing the uploaded files, the uploaded file may exfiltrate data from the server or network.
  - **Website Defacement:** Uploaded malicious files could be used to deface the website if processed or rendered without sanitization.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload Functionality:** The vulnerability is exploited through the file upload mechanism present in the `plupload.php` functionality. By crafting a malicious file with a non-blocked extension, an attacker can upload it through the available interface.
  
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Upload Functionality:** The attacker must have access to the file upload feature where the vulnerable code exists. This might require being a logged in user, or accessing a publicly available upload endpoint.
- **Knowledge of Allowed Extensions (in the old implementation) and Upload Mechanisms:** The attacker needs to understand how the file upload is processed to be able to craft a suitable file name with a non-blocked extension.

**Details from the provided content:**

The commit `33eb4cc0f80c1f86388c1862a8aee1061fa5d72e` addresses this vulnerability by changing the following:

- **`src/MicroweberPackages/App/functions/plupload.php`:** The logic was modified to check if the uploaded file's extension is present in a list of allowed extensions, instead of just checking if it is a dangerous extension, ensuring only allowed files are uploaded.
  ```diff
  -if ($is_dangerous_file) {
  +if ($is_allowed_file == false) {
  ```

- **`src/MicroweberPackages/Utils/System/Files.php`:** New function `is_allowed_file` is introduced and implemented to perform the file extension check against the allowed extensions of file types.
  - Allowed file types are defined in the function `get_allowed_files_extensions_for_upload` and includes: images, audios, videos, files, documents and archives.
  - The default extensions of allowed file types are defined in `get_allowed_files_extensions_for_upload`, and were extended in this commit to include `webp` and `ico` for images, and `ogv`, `3gp` and `3g2` for videos.

This commit provides a more robust approach to file upload validation.
