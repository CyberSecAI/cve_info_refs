**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-0630

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a missing type check before accessing a hash. Specifically, the code assumes that the operand of a double splat operator (`**`) is always a hash. However, this isn't guaranteed, leading to a potential type error when it isn't.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The code lacks a proper type validation. Specifically, `mrb_assert(mrb_hash_p(hash));` and `mrb_ensure_hash_type(mrb, hash);` were not enough for the case of a double splat (`**`) operand not being a hash.
*   **Impact:** If the operand is not a hash, accessing it as if it were a hash could lead to undefined behavior, potential crashes, or other unexpected consequences.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves providing a non-hash value as the operand to a double splat operator, which could be done by crafting specific input that triggers the vulnerable code path in the mruby virtual machine.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the mruby virtual machine or provide the code being executed with an input that results in a non-hash being used where a hash is expected.

**Technical Details:**

The fix is in the `vm.c` file of the mruby project. The commit message "vm.c: should check type before hash access." indicates the core problem and its solution. The code change introduces type checking before a hash is accessed, avoiding the assumption that the operand of a `**` operator is always a hash.

**Code Snippet:**

```diff
@@ -2766,7 +2766,7 @@
   int lim = a+b*2+1;
 
   hash = regs[a];
-  mrb_assert(mrb_hash_p(hash));
+  mrb_ensure_hash_type(mrb, hash);
   for (i=a+1; i<lim; i+=2) {
     mrb_hash_set(mrb, hash, regs[i], regs[i+1]);
   }

```

The change replaces `mrb_assert(mrb_hash_p(hash))` with `mrb_ensure_hash_type(mrb, hash)`, which ensures that `hash` is a hash object.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content from github.com provides more detail about the fix than the official CVE description, specifically the location of the vulnerable code in `vm.c`, and the nature of the fix. huntr.dev seems to be unrelated to the CVE.
