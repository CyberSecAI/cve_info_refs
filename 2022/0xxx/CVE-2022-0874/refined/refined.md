- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "WP Social Buttons" does not sanitize and escape its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin settings, which are then executed when a user views the affected pages. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as redirecting users, stealing cookies, or performing unauthorized actions on the website.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker would need to be logged in as a high-privilege user, such as an administrator, and input the malicious payload into the "Delay Time (General Settings)" or "Top Margin (Advanced Settings)" fields.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrator or similar high-level access to the WordPress site.
