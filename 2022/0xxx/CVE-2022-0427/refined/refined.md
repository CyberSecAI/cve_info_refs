  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject arbitrary HTML into Jupyter notebook outputs. Although DOMPurify sanitizes the HTML, it does not remove arbitrary `data-*` attributes. GitLab's JavaScript uses these `data-*` attributes to trigger actions, specifically POST requests, through event listeners and DOM manipulations. By crafting specific HTML with controlled `data-*` attributes an attacker can force a victim's browser to make arbitrary POST requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization: DOMPurify does not strip arbitrary `data-*` attributes, which can be abused by attackers to trigger actions.",
      "Reliance on client-side data attributes for sensitive actions: GitLab's JavaScript relies on `data-*` attributes to construct POST requests, making them vulnerable to manipulation via HTML injection.",
       "Insecure use of event listeners: Event listeners on the client side are not adequately secured, allowing attacker-controlled HTML to trigger them to perform unintended POST actions."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can make arbitrary POST requests as a victim user. This can lead to various malicious outcomes depending on the targeted endpoint, including:\n - Creating a new admin account for the attacker.\n - Forcing invites to private projects.\n - Adding todos on issues.\n - Performing any other POST request that the victim has authorization to execute. The most severe impact is the potential for privilege escalation, such as an attacker gaining admin access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTML injection: The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious HTML into Jupyter notebook output fields.",
       "Abuse of data attributes: The attacker crafts HTML with specific data-* attributes that trigger POST requests via GitLab's JavaScript",
       "User Interaction: The victim has to load the crafted Jupyter Notebook."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create or modify Jupyter notebooks: The attacker needs to be able to create a notebook file.",
      "Understanding of GitLab's JavaScript:  The attacker needs knowledge of the specific `data-*` attributes that trigger GitLab's JavaScript functionality to perform POST requests.",
       "Ability to make victim load the notebook: The attacker has to get a victim user to view the crafted notebook with the malicious HTML injection."
