Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the exploitation of the Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism, which is a required component of the HomePlug GreenPHY (HPGP) standard used in the Combined Charging System (CCS) for electric vehicles. The attacker continuously transmits a signal, preventing legitimate communication between the EV and EVSE.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSMA/CA Exploitation:** The core vulnerability lies in the predictable behavior of the CSMA/CA mechanism. By continuously transmitting a preamble signal, an attacker can force both the EV and EVSE to indefinitely defer their own transmissions, effectively blocking communication.
*   **Unshielded Charging Cables:** The charging cables act as unintentional antennas, making them susceptible to electromagnetic interference. The lack of shielding allows the attacker's signal to couple onto the wires, disrupting communication.
*   **Lack of Robustness:** The communication protocol lacks sufficient robustness to handle continuous interference. Even a short disruption can lead to a timeout and termination of the charging session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disruption of Charging:** The primary impact is the interruption of the charging process. The attack causes the charging session to abort, preventing the vehicle from being charged.
*   **Denial of Service:** This can lead to a denial of service for individual vehicles or entire fleets, potentially affecting critical services like electric ambulances.
*   **Inconvenience:** While not as critical, the attack also causes inconvenience for individual EV owners.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Attack:** The attack is conducted wirelessly using electromagnetic interference.
*   **Electromagnetic Emanation:** The attacker transmits the attack signal over the air, which couples onto the charging cable of the victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the HPGP standard and CSMA/CA mechanism.
*   **Radio Hardware:** Off-the-shelf radio hardware, like a Software Defined Radio (SDR) and an amplifier, are required to generate and transmit the attack signal.
*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within a certain range of the charging cable, which can be extended by using a power amplifier (up to 47m with 1W power).
*   **Signal Generation:** The attacker needs to be able to generate a signal that mimics the preamble used by HPGP.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The attack can be executed with a relatively low power budget and can be scaled to disrupt multiple charging sessions simultaneously.
*   The vulnerability is present in all known implementations of the standard, affecting a wide range of EVs and charging stations using CCS.
*   The charging cable acts as an unintentional antenna and is susceptible to electromagnetic interference, making it relatively easy to execute this attack.
*   The attack does not appear to cause any long-term damage to the vehicles.
*   The attack can be performed even by a drive-by attacker.
