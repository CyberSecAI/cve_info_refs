Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The BookingPress plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied POST data before using it in a dynamically constructed SQL query. Specifically, the `bookingpress_front_get_category_services` AJAX action, which is available to unauthenticated users, is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** User-provided input (`category_id` and `total_service`) is directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization, leading to a SQL Injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive data from the database.
*   **Time-Based Attacks:** The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates the possibility of using time-based payloads (e.g., `SLEEP()`) to extract information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to be logged in or have any prior privileges on the WordPress site.
*   **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability lies within an AJAX action (`bookingpress_front_get_category_services`) accessible through `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need to have any user account on the target site.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the vulnerable AJAX endpoint and how to craft a malicious request.
* **Nonce Extraction:** The attacker needs to be able to extract a nonce, which is present in the HTML code in the front end of the site.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes detailed Proof of Concept (PoC) examples demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability using `curl`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.6.
*   The issue is fixed in version 1.0.11 of the plugin, as indicated in the changelog.
* The vulnerability is associated with CVE-2022-0739.
