Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `postid` parameter before it is outputted on an admin page. Specifically, the `postid` parameter from the URL is directly inserted into the HTML code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The unsanitized input is reflected back to the user's browser, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** If successfully exploited, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the vulnerable website.
- **Session Hijacking:** The injected script can be used to steal cookies or session tokens, potentially leading to account takeover.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could also deface the website or redirect the user to a malicious site.
- **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can use the injected script to distribute malware to the visitors of the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing a payload in the `postid` parameter and tricks an administrator to visit it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct a URL with a malicious script in the `postid` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user (admin) into clicking on the malicious link to trigger the XSS vulnerability in their browser.
- **No Authentication Required:** This vulnerability can be triggered by any user if they can trick an administrator to click on the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 1.1.5 of the "AP Pricing Tables Lite" WordPress plugin.
- The provided proof-of-concept URL demonstrates how the `postid` parameter can be manipulated to trigger the XSS vulnerability.
- The fix involved using `esc_attr()` to sanitize the output of the `postid` parameter.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')).
- The CVSS score is 6.1 (Medium) with vectors AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
