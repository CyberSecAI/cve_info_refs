{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out of bounds read in ANGLE.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out of bounds read",
  "Impact of exploitation": "May lead to information disclosure or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the context of the read and how the read data is used.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is in the ANGLE graphics library which means that any content that triggers code execution in ANGLE may expose the vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious web page or exploit a web service to trigger the vulnerability. This could be done remotely."
