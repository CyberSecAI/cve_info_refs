  "CVE-2022-0924": {
    "description": "Out-of-bounds Read error in tiffcp",
    "root_cause": "A heap buffer overflow exists in `cpContigBufToSeparateBuf` within `tools/tiffcp.c`. Specifically, an out-of-bounds read occurs due to insufficient bounds checking when copying data between buffers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap buffer overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS) can be caused by triggering a heap buffer overflow using a crafted TIFF file. This may lead to program termination due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted TIFF file",
      "Processing of a malicious TIFF image with the `tiffcp` tool"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted TIFF file as input to the `tiffcp` tool. No special privileges are required to trigger this vulnerability."
