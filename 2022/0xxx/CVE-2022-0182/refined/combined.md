The plugin is precisely what I needed to create lead magnet quizzes for my sites. I found a small bug and it was quickly solved by the team, even though I only use the free version.

Support was prompt. However there are lot of small UX issues that grow into big ones. Make sure you click save and are deliberate with all actions you make, otherwise quizzes won’t show up the way you’re looking for them to. That said, it gives you a lot more flexibility than other quiz platforms (admittedly I haven’t gotten far with many others). Good luck and have fun! -d
