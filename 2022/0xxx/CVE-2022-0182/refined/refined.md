Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0182:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw within the "Quiz And Survey Master" WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's database. These scripts are then executed in the browsers of other users who access the affected website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful attack allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the browsers of users accessing the website.
- **Potential for wider attacks:** An attacker could potentially perform malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the website's content
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker leverages the stored XSS vulnerability by injecting malicious script through a vulnerable input field or parameter of the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low Privileged User:** An attacker with low privileges (e.g., a regular user account) within the WordPress site is sufficient to inject malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation involves the victim user accessing a page or part of the application where the attacker's stored malicious script is displayed.

**Additional Details**
- This vulnerability was identified and reported by Tsutomu Aramaki of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc.
