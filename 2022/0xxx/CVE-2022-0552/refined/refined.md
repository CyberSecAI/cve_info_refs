**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an incomplete fix for the `netty-codec-http` vulnerability (CVE-2021-21409) in the OpenShift Logging `elasticsearch6` container image. The vulnerable `netty-codec-http` maven package was not removed from the image content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Fix:** The primary vulnerability lies in the fact that the initial fix for CVE-2021-21409 was not fully implemented in the affected container image. The vulnerable library was not removed.
*   **Dependency Vulnerability:** The presence of the vulnerable `netty-codec-http` package within the container image created a continued exposure to the security flaws associated with CVE-2021-21409.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided content does not specify the exact impact of exploiting CVE-2021-21409, which CVE-2022-0552 is a continuation of.

Based on the CVE description of CVE-2021-21409, exploitation could lead to an impact on availability due to an out of memory error.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through network requests targeting the vulnerable `elasticsearch6` container image that has the vulnerable `netty-codec-http` package.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
