Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of user-provided data (`$rule_display`) in the `includes/html/modal/alert_rule_list.inc.php` file. Specifically, the code was using `htmlentities()` to escape the display data, but this was insufficient to prevent XSS because HTML tags were still present in the output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `$rule_display` variable, which could contain user-controlled HTML, is displayed in the alert rule list modal without being properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within the `$rule_display` variable. When a user views the alert rule list modal, this injected script would execute within their browser session.
- **Data Exfiltration/Modification:** The attacker could steal user session cookies, modify page content, or perform other actions on behalf of the victim user.
- **Account Takeover:** If combined with other techniques, the attacker could potentially escalate privileges and take over user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Alert rule configuration**: An attacker with the ability to create or modify alert rules could introduce malicious HTML or JavaScript into the `$rule_display` field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the LibreNMS platform to create or modify alert rules.
- **Access to Alert Rule Configuration:** The attacker must have the ability to access and edit the alert rule configurations.

- The original code was only using `htmlentities()` to escape the HTML, which would not remove the injected HTML tags.
- The patched code adds `strip_tags()` before `htmlentities()`, removing any HTML elements, thus preventing the XSS.
