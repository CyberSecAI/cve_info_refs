{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from an issue in how coupon codes are handled within the cart and checkout process. Specifically, the system does not correctly validate coupon codes during checkout after they have been applied and stored in the session. This allows users to bypass coupon restrictions by manipulating their session data, thus enabling them to use expired or invalid coupons.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of coupon codes during checkout.",
      "Reliance on session data without proper verification."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this by manipulating session data to apply invalid or expired coupons, leading to incorrect discounts. This could result in financial losses for the site owner, as customers can purchase items at lower prices than intended.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Session manipulation"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to modify session data (e.g., cookies)."
    ]
