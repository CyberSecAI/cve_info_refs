- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `nx_id` parameter from a REST API endpoint is used directly in a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially extract sensitive information from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a POST request to the `/notificationx/v1/analytics` REST endpoint with a crafted `nx_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
