Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2022-0750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue caused by the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-controlled input within the "Photoswipe Masonry Gallery" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the `thumbnail_width`, `thumbnail_height`, `max_image_width`, and `max_image_height` parameters are not sanitized when saving plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the plugin's settings and stored in the database. This code will then execute whenever a user accesses the PhotoSwipe Options page or views a page containing a gallery created using the plugin.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize or validate the `thumbnail_width`, `thumbnail_height`, `max_image_width`, and `max_image_height` parameters before saving them.
*   **Missing Capability Check:** The plugin's update function, which handles saving settings, lacks a capability check, meaning that any authenticated user (not just administrators) can update plugin settings by sending a crafted POST request with `photoswipe_save` set to true.
*    **Insecure use of `admin_menu` hook**: The `admin_menu` action hook does not validate if a user is an administrator, only that the user is authenticated in the /wp-admin area.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser, when accessing a gallery with the plugin or when an administrator accesses the plugin settings page.
*   **Site Compromise:** The injected malicious JavaScript could be used to:
    *   Redirect site visitors to malicious domains.
    *   Inject new administrative user accounts.
    *   Perform other actions that could lead to complete site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to `/wp-admin`, with the `photoswipe_save` parameter set to true and malicious JavaScript injected into the `thumbnail_width`, `thumbnail_height`, `max_image_width`, and `max_image_height` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the vulnerable WordPress site, but they do not need administrator level permissions to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in plugin versions <= 1.2.14.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.2.15.
*   The Wordfence firewall provides protection against this vulnerability with its built-in XSS protection.
*   The `stripslashes` function is used but is not effective against XSS attacks.
*   The plugin's settings page (PhotoSwipe Options) was vulnerable, meaning that any administrator accessing the plugin settings could trigger the malicious code if it was previously injected.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.4 (Medium).

This detailed analysis provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and its potential impact.
