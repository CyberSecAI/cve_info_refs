Subject: Vulnerability in Jenkins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

The following releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Jenkins 2.334
* Jenkins LTS 2.319.3

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:

SECURITY-2602 / CVE-2021-43859 (upstream) & CVE-2022-0538 (Jenkins)
Jenkins 2.333 and earlier, LTS 2.319.2 and earlier is affected by the
XStream library's vulnerability CVE-2021-43859. This library is used by
Jenkins to serialize and deserialize various XML files, like global and job
`config.xml`, `build.xml`, and numerous others.

This allows attackers able to submit crafted XML files to Jenkins to be
parsed as configuration, e.g. through the `POST config.xml` API, to cause a
denial of service (DoS).

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2022-02-09

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* Jenkins (core)

## Descriptions

### DoS vulnerability in bundled XStream library

**SECURITY-2602
/
CVE-2021-43859 (upstream issue), CVE-2022-0538 (Jenkins-specific converters)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**Description:**

Jenkins 2.333 and earlier, LTS 2.319.2 and earlier is affected by the XStream library’s vulnerability [CVE-2021-43859](https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2021-43859.html).
This library is used by Jenkins to serialize and deserialize various XML files, like global and job `config.xml`, `build.xml`, and numerous others.

This allows attackers able to submit crafted XML files to Jenkins to be parsed as configuration, e.g. through the `POST config.xml` API, to cause a denial of service (DoS).

Jenkins 2.334, LTS 2.319.3 updates the version of the XStream library used.

Additionally, custom collection converters defined in Jenkins have been updated to apply the same DoS detection as those defined in XStream.

|  | While the XStream dependency has been updated previously in the 2.333 weekly release, the Jenkins-specific changes in 2.334 are necessary for Jenkins to be protected. |
| --- | --- |

|  | Denial of service is detected via unexpectedly long-running collection-related operations. In case of very complex configurations, it is possible that there are false positive detections. Set the [Java system property `hudson.util.XStream2.collectionUpdateLimit`](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-util-xstream2-collectionupdatelimit) to a number of seconds that a given XML file can take to load collections. Use `-1` to disable this protection entirely. |
