Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-0593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The WordPress plugin "Login with phone number" prior to version 1.3.7 included a file named `delete.php` within its directory. This file could be accessed directly without any authentication or authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Unauthenticated Access:** The `delete.php` file was accessible to any user, including those not logged into the WordPress site.
* **Missing Authorization:** The code within `delete.php` lacked any checks to verify if the user had the authority to delete plugin files.
* **Remote File Deletion:** The script in `delete.php` allowed for the deletion of the plugin's files via a simple GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit would lead to the deletion of the plugin's files, causing it to stop functioning. This could disrupt user logins, registrations, and any other features of the website relying on the plugin.
* **Potential for Further Attacks:** While the primary impact is DoS, deleting plugin files can also serve as a precursor to more serious attacks, potentially leading to site compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Direct HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability was exploitable by sending a direct HTTP GET request to the vulnerable `delete.php` file. The vulnerable URL follows this pattern: `/wp-content/plugins/login-with-phone-number/delete.php?delete=1`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **No Authentication Required:** The attacker did not need to be logged into the WordPress website, or have any specific permissions.
* **Basic Network Access:** The attacker only needed to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the WordPress site.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability was classified as "File Deletion".
* It was assigned a CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.7 of the plugin.
* The vulnerability is related to OWASP Top 10 "A6: Security Misconfiguration" and CWE-73.
* The researcher who discovered the vulnerability was Michal Lipinski, from beastiecode.com.
