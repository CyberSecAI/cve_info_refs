- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `mmursp_id` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `mmursp_id` parameter and tricks a user into clicking the URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special permissions; they simply need to get the victim to visit the crafted malicious URL.
