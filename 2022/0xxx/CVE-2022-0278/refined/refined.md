Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-submitted data within the contact form. Specifically, the code was not sanitizing or encoding user input before displaying it in the notification email/admin panel, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The code was directly printing user-supplied data (`$val1` and `$val1_1`) without proper sanitization or escaping. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via the contact form fields.
* **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The code lacked proper input sanitization or output encoding using functions such as `htmlspecialchars()` before displaying the data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript code into the contact form. When this data is displayed (e.g., in the notification email or in the admin panel), the injected script would execute in the context of the victim's browser.
* **Session Hijacking:** Successful execution of malicious JavaScript could lead to session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
* **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies or other sensitive data from users through the injected scripts.
* **Defacement:** The attacker might alter content of the page where the injected script runs, causing defacement of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Contact Form:** The attack vector is the contact form, where the attacker enters malicious scripts as input within the form fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to submit data through the contact form.
* No special privileges are needed; any user capable of submitting the contact form could attempt this attack.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided commit diff shows the fix was to add `htmlentities()` around the print statement that outputs user data. This ensures that any HTML or JavaScript will be displayed as text, preventing the XSS attack. The code adds `htmlentities()` in two locations, once for singular values and once for arrays of values, to cover all cases of user input.
