## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Salon booking system < 7.6.3 - Unauthenticated Sensitive Data Disclosure

### Description

The plugin does not have proper authorisation when searching bookings, allowing any unauthenticated users to search other's booking, as well as retrieve sensitive information about the bookings, such as the full name, email and phone number of the person who booked it.

### Proof of Concept

Although the API only returns the name of customer, the search feature can be abused to leak email and phone, for example, search "a@", "b@", "c@"... to determine email address char by char.
curl -X POST https://example.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php -d 'action=salon&day=2022-03-11&search=%40&method=SearchBookings'
