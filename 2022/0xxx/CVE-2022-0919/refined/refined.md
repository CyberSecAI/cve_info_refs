- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Salon booking system plugin lacks proper authorization when searching bookings. This allows unauthenticated users to search bookings and retrieve sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization for booking searches, leading to sensitive data disclosure. Specifically, the plugin does not check if the user has the appropriate permissions to access booking information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as full names, email addresses, and phone numbers of individuals who have made bookings through the salon booking system. This information can be used for malicious purposes such as phishing, identity theft, or spam campaigns.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send a POST request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=salon`, `method=SearchBookings`, `day`, and `search` parameters. By manipulating the search parameter, an attacker can progressively reveal email addresses by searching character by character (e.g., "a@", "b@", "c@").
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description, specifically how to exploit the vulnerability using a POST request and how to enumerate email addresses character by character. It also mentions the affected plugin versions, which are the "salon-booking-system" and "salon-booking-plugin-pro" versions before 7.6.3.
