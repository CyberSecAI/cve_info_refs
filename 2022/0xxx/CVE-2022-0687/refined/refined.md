The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Amelia WordPress plugin.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The plugin allows users to upload image blobs which are then stored as actual files. The file extension is controlled by the user, which enables the upload of PHP backdoors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted file upload with user-controlled file extensions.
- Lack of sanitization or validation on the uploaded file content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution on the server.
- An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By exploiting the notification feature, an attacker can upload a base64 encoded PHP payload disguised as an image.
- The `content` parameter in the notification payload allows for embedding the malicious base64 encoded image which is later rendered as a file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the custom "Amelia Manager" role.
- The attacker needs to be logged-in to the WordPress dashboard.
- No other special network position is mentioned, implying an attack is possible from anywhere with access to the WordPress login page.
