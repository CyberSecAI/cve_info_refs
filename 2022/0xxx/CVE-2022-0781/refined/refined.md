Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `nirweb-support` WordPress plugin not properly sanitizing and escaping a parameter before using it in a SQL query via an AJAX action. This action is accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL Injection (SQLi). Specifically, the lack of sanitization on user-supplied input allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials (as demonstrated in the PoC), and modify data or potentially gain further access or control.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through an unauthenticated AJAX action provided by the plugin. Attackers can send a crafted request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with a malicious SQL payload in the `id_form` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They can be in any network position as long as they can send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The plugin fails to sanitize the `id_form` parameter in the `answerd_ticket` AJAX action. An attacker can exploit this by sending a request to `admin-ajax.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `id_form` parameter such as:
`'action=answerd\_ticket&id\_form=1 UNION ALL SELECT NULL,NULL,(SELECT user\_pass FROM wp\_users WHERE ID = 1),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL-- -'`
This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leaking sensitive data like user passwords.

The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.8.2 of the plugin.
