Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The Gmedia Photo Gallery plugin fails to sanitize and escape the Album's name before outputting it in pages/posts with a media embed.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious scripts into the Album's name. This script will then be executed when users view pages/posts with media from the affected album, allowing the attacker to perform actions such as redirecting users, stealing session cookies, or other malicious activities.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create/edit Albums
    *   The XSS is triggered when viewing the media post that contains media belonging to the album containing the malicious payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have administrator or similar level privileges (Admin+) in WordPress.
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the WordPress admin panel

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Gmedia Photo Gallery versions prior to 1.20.0.
*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the vulnerability by creating an album with a malicious payload in its name and then adding media from the affected album.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 3.4, indicating a low severity.

This vulnerability allows for Stored XSS because the malicious payload is stored in the database.
