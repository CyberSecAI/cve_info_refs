```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the hostname provided in the payload URL of a webhook. Specifically, the application was not correctly identifying and blocking requests to local network addresses, which could lead to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). The application was not properly validating the hostname in the webhook's payload URL, allowing an attacker to potentially make requests to internal or local addresses.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could exploit the SSRF vulnerability to make unauthorized requests to internal resources, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or further attacks on internal systems.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the webhook functionality. An attacker could create or modify a webhook with a payload URL pointing to a local network address.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create or modify webhooks within the application. Non-admin users were initially able to exploit the vulnerability."
