- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape user-submitted usernames during login when displaying them in the log dashboard.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes when an administrator views the login log dashboard, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker crafts a malicious username containing JavaScript code and submits it via the login form. The XSS is triggered when the admin views the log in the 'All User' section.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit a login request, but does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges.
