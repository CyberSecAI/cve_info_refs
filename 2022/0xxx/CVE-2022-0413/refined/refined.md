Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-0413:

**Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The vulnerability occurs in `src/ex_cmds.c` specifically within the substitute command functionality of Vim.
*   The issue arises when the substitute command uses a recursive function call.
*   The old substitute pattern is freed prematurely leading to use of freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability can lead to a crash due to the use-after-free condition.
*   The Debian LTS advisory mentions that the use-after-free may lead to a denial-of-service (application crash) or other unspecified impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves using the substitute command with a recursive function call.
*   The attacker needs to craft a specific input or command sequence that triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be able to execute vim commands or provide input to vim that can trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   No specific privileges are needed other than the ability to run vim with the crafted input.

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix involves making a copy of the substitute text before a recursive function call to avoid the use-after-free.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in patch 8.2.4253.
*   The vulnerability is mentioned in the context of security updates for Fedora and Debian.
*   The vulnerability was also present in Gentoo.

The github commit log also confirms the issue and the fix: "Problem: Using freed memory when substitute uses a recursive function call. Solution: Make a copy of the substitute text."
