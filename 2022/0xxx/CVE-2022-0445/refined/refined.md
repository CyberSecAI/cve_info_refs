- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress Real Cookie Banner plugin lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when resetting its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to reset the plugin's settings.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious request that, when triggered by a logged-in admin, resets the plugin's settings. This request is typically triggered by the victim visiting a malicious page or link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into triggering the malicious request.
