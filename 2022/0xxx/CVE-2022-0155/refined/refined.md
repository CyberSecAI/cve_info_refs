Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0155:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `follow-redirects` library not dropping the `Cookie` header when redirecting to a different domain. This can lead to the exposure of sensitive cookie data to unauthorized domains.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of HTTP headers during redirects. Specifically, the library fails to remove or sanitize sensitive headers like `Cookie` when redirecting to a different origin.
- Exposure of sensitive information through unintended sharing of cookie data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of private personal information to an unauthorized actor. Specifically, an attacker could potentially gain access to a user's session cookies, leading to account hijacking or other malicious activities.
- The impact is described as confidentiality impact: High, with no impact to integrity or availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious URL that redirects to a different domain after an initial request to a trusted origin, potentially leading to cookie theft if the request includes a `Cookie` header.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by controlling the redirection target.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into making a request that is then redirected to a domain controlled by the attacker. This could be achieved via a crafted malicious link/URL.
- The user needs to make a request that includes a `Cookie` header.
- The user interaction is required for this exploit, thus, a UI/User Interaction vector is involved.
