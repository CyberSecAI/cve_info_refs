- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin lacks authentication and authorization for an AJAX action, allowing unauthenticated users to access it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication and authorization controls, leading to an unauthenticated sensitive data disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can retrieve the email addresses of subscribed users.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with specific parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not require authentication or specific user privileges. They only need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
