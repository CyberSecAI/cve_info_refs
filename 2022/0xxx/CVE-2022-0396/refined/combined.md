GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliﬁes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-4160

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring procedure. Many EC algorithms
are affected, including some of the TLS 1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because
the pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing private keys. Analysis
suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difﬁcult to perform
and are not believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible (although very difﬁcult)
because most of the work necessary to deduce information about a private key may be performed
ofﬂine. The amount of resources required for such an attack would be signiﬁcant. However, for an
attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have to share the DH private key among multiple
clients, which is no longer an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions
1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and 3.0.1 on the 15th of December
2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium
support customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is released. The issue only affects
OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m
(Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-23839

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2 with a server that is conﬁgured
to support both SSLv2 and more recent SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version
rollback attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or TLS versions greater
than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of padding. A server that supports greater than
SSLv2 is supposed to reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of padding
is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has occurred (i.e. both client and server
support greater than SSLv2, and yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation
of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection attempt is accepted if the padding
is present, and rejected if it is absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if
a version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will erroneously reject a connection if a
normal SSLv2 connection attempt is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x
are affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must: 1) have conﬁgured SSLv2
support at compile time (this is off by default), 2) have conﬁgured SSLv2 support at runtime (this
is off by default), 3) have conﬁgured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the default ciphersuite
list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue.
The underlying error is in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This
also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other functions. Although
1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the
RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that function or use that padding
mode will encounter this issue. However since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this
is considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no
longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to
1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).

CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength

Vulnerability CVE-2021-23841

The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash
value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certiﬁcate. However it
fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer ﬁeld (which might occur if
the issuer ﬁeld is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and
a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is
never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function
directly and they use it on certiﬁcates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue. However OpenSSL
1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates. Premium support customers of
OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y. Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL
1.1.1j (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2x).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-25217

The affected products contain the third party component, ISC DHCP, that possesses a vulnerability
if used as a DHCP client or server. The vulnerability affects the DHCP package when storing and
reading DHCP lease information containing particular option information.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to affect the availability of the DHCP client or server, or
in the worst case affect the conﬁdentiality or integrity of device through a buffer overﬂow or cause a
remote-code execution.
