- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an uncontrolled search path element in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR agent software on Windows. This allows a local user with file creation privileges in the Windows root directory (such as C:\) to potentially execute a program with elevated privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is an uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427), which the software uses when trying to load components/executables.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a local attacker to achieve local privilege escalation (PE), enabling them to execute programs with elevated privileges. This can lead to unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of data and systems.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local. An authenticated local user with the ability to create files in the root directory (C:\) can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires local access to a Windows system with a vulnerable version of the Cortex XDR agent installed. The attacker must have high privileges to be able to create files in the Windows root directory.
