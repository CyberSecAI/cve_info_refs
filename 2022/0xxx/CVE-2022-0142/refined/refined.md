{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within form entries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSV Injection. Unsanitized input from form fields is included in the exported CSV file.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user, even with low or no privileges, can inject malicious commands into form fields. When the exported CSV file is opened by an admin, these commands are executed, potentially leading to code execution on the admin's machine.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects a payload into any text or HTML field of a published form. The payload is then included in the exported CSV file when an administrator exports form entries.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be any user with the ability to submit a form, even without login."
