## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Visual Form Builder < 3.0.6 - CSV Injection

### Description

The plugin is vulnerable to CSV injection allowing a user with low level or no privileges to inject a command that will be included in the exported CSV file, leading to possible code execution.

### Proof of Concept

Endpoint - http://<<example.com>>/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=vfb-export
Payload - =cmd|' /C notepad'!'A1' (Non malicious payload)
Issue Description - Entries of the form are vulnerable to CSV/Formula Injection
1. Submit the payload in any field (Text or HTML) of a published form (Any user can perform this)
2. Now Login as an admin, Go to → Visual Form Builder → Export Tab
3. Export the fields as a CSV File and open the file to see the payload getting executed.
