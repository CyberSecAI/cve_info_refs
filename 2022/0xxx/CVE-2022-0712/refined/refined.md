    ],
    "impact": "A null pointer dereference can lead to a crash, causing a denial-of-service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted file that causes a null pointer to be accessed in the `symbols()` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to radare2 that will trigger the null pointer dereference.",
    "additional_info": "The fix adds a check to ensure the `sym` pointer is not null before dereferencing it in the `symbols()` function within `bin_symbols.c`."
