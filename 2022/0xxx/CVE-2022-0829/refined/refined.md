Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0829:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/cron/save_allow.cgi` endpoint within the Webmin application. This endpoint is responsible for controlling user access to scheduled cron jobs. The root cause is a missing access control check (ACL permission check) within this specific endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Authorization:** Any authenticated low-privilege user, regardless of their intended access rights to the cron module, can access `/cron/save_allow.cgi`.
*   **Missing ACL Check:** The code does not verify if the user has the necessary permissions to modify cron job access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can manipulate the `cron_allow` and `cron_deny` files, effectively controlling which users are allowed or denied access to scheduled cron jobs.
*   This can lead to denial of service by preventing legitimate users from running scheduled tasks, and in some cases can lead to an attacker being able to escalate their privileges via manipulation of scheduled jobs.
*   The vulnerability allows modification or restriction of a system function (cron job management) outside the user's intended limitations.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Authenticated access required:** The attacker needs valid Webmin credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the Webmin system, even with low privileges.
*   The attacker does not need specific access rights to the cron module, as the vulnerability lies precisely in the lack of access control checks on the affected endpoint.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided information indicates the fix for the vulnerability was to add an ACL permission check to the `save_allow.cgi` script, which prevents unauthorized access to the cron job access control mechanism.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.990 of Webmin.
