I've found a Heap Buffer Overflow vulnerability in ImageMagick 7.1.0-20.(github commit ID [f54aa4e](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/f54aa4e7ba8a8fb82d200844dc59804f5f6c8cbf) in Tue Jan 18 20:00:38 2022 -0500).When someone uses magick to convert a tiff-format image into a picon-format file, the bug will be traggered on. Please feel free to contact me. Regards, ZhangJiaxing Steps to Reproduce  1. git clone ImageMagick 2. ./configure CC=gcc CFLAGS="-g -fsanitize=address" && make 3. cd utilities &&./magick convert /path/to/poc.tiff output.picon 4.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2045943#c0)  Todd Cullum    2022-01-26 02:24:21 UTC  ``` There's a heap buffer overread that was discovered in ImageMagick version 7.1.0-20 in GetPixelAlpha() declared in MagickCore/pixel-accessor.h. A specially crafted file could trigger this and potentially cause a denial of service or information leak.  Reference: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/issues/4729> Upstream patch commit: <https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick/commit/e50f19fd73c792ebe912df8ab83aa51a243a3da7>   ``` |  |
