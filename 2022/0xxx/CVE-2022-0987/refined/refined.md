Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from how certain methods within PackageKit's Transaction interface handle file existence checks. Specifically, methods like `InstallFiles` do not drop privileges before accessing files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Timing Side Channel:** The vulnerability arises because methods like `InstallFiles` exhibit different execution times depending on whether the target file exists. If the file exists, it attempts to read it, which takes more time compared to when the file doesn't exist, where the method fails silently and returns quickly.
- **Privilege Handling:** The methods in the Transaction interface do not drop privileges before performing file system access checks, allowing the timing difference to be observable to a user who may not have permissions to directly read the files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to determine the existence of files owned by root or other users. While the content of the files isn't directly exposed, the knowledge of their existence can be valuable for crafting more sophisticated attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
- **Timing Analysis:** The attacker needs to be able to measure the time taken for specific PackageKit methods to execute. This is typically done by repeatedly invoking the vulnerable methods against a suspected file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be a local user on the target system.
- The attacker does not require any elevated privileges or special permissions beyond a standard user account.

**Additional Notes:**
- The description mentions that the `InstallFiles` method fails silently with a non-existing file which is important for understanding why the timing difference is observable.
- The bug report links to other related bugs (2064361, 2064372, 2064373), suggesting the issue might have a broader impact across different Fedora releases.
- The severity of the vulnerability is marked as "low".
