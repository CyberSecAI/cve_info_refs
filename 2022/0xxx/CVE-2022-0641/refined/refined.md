- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to sanitize and escape the `ays_fb_tab` parameter before outputting it on an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with a payload in the `ays_fb_tab` parameter and tricking a user into accessing this URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user (likely an admin) to click it.
