The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0257.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation when renaming pricing rules in the Pimcore e-commerce framework. The code initially lacked a check to ensure that the new rule name only contained alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of the new pricing rule name. Specifically, the server-side code at `bundles/EcommerceFrameworkBundle/Controller/PricingController.php` did not validate input before renaming. The original code allowed any character as part of the rule name.
- **Client-side validation bypass:** The fix implemented server side validation, but the initial commit also included a client-side javascript validation in `bundles/EcommerceFrameworkBundle/Resources/public/js/pricing/config/panel.js` to add a similar regex validation for new rule names. This could be bypassed client side.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- This could potentially allow an attacker to inject arbitrary characters into the pricing rule name, which may cause unexpected behavior in the application or potentially lead to other vulnerabilities such as XSS if the names are not properly handled during rendering.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted request to the `pimcore_ecommerceframework_pricing_rename` endpoint, containing a malicious string as the new rule name which would bypass the initial regex validation, or by bypassing client side validation

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to rename pricing rules in the Pimcore e-commerce framework. This likely requires authenticated access to the administrative interface.
