Based on the provided information, the commit `e607e5f745cd99d5c06a7fce16b3577fab8e1250` in the `microweber/microweber` repository appears to be related to a bug fix or improvement related to database reloading and module updates. The commit modifies two files:

1.  `userfiles/modules/admin/backup/js/restore.js`: This file is related to the backup and restore functionality. The commit adds a call to `mw.clear_cache()` and `mw.notification.success("The DB was reloaded")` after a database reload. It also includes a call to `$.post(mw.settings.api_url + 'mw_post_update')` within the `reload_mw_db` function. This suggests that the reload functionality now has a notification and clears the cache after the db is updated.
2.  `userfiles/modules/microweber/api/api.js`: A minor change is made, but not explained, likely related to a temporary module reload queue. The line `mw.temp_reload_module_queue_holder = [];` is added.

However, this commit doesn't describe any specific security vulnerabilities. The changes focus on enhancing the backup and restore process, specifically related to database reloading and cache clearing and module updating. There's no indication of any security flaw being addressed or any vulnerability being exploited through the described changes.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is **NOINFO** related to CVE-2022-0504.
