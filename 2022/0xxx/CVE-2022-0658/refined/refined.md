The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0658.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `location` parameter within the `calendar_data` AJAX action, before being used in dynamically constructed SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious SQL queries into the `location` parameter. This could allow for unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or potentially gain control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `calendar_data` AJAX action, which is accessible to unauthenticated users. The `location` parameter is the injection point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
