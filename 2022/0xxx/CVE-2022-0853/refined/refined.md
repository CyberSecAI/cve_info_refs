    "description": "A memory leak on the jboss client side, when using UserTransaction repeatedly. Such as:\n\n private void testTransaction() throws Exception {\n  for(int i=1; i< 500000; i++) {\n    System.out.println(\"Starting process \" + i);\n    // get the UserTransaction and EJB Proxy\n    Context ctx = getInitialContext(host, port, username, password);\n    UserTransaction tx = getUserTransaction(ctx);\n    ControllerRemote cr = (ControllerRemote)\n   ctx.lookup(\"Controller/Controller\" + \"!com.test.usertransaction.ControllerRemote\");\n    try {\n      tx.begin();\n    }\n    catch(Exception ex1) {\n      ex1.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    //System.out.println(\"user transaction started\");\n    cr.mainCall();\n    try {\n      tx.commit();;\n    }\n    catch(Exception ex1) {\n      ex1.printStackTrace();\n      throw ex1;\n    }\n    //System.out.println(\"commited user transaction\");\n    if(ctx != null)\n      ctx.close();\n  }\n}\nTransaction is executed by a remote client on a EJB deployed in EAP 7.3. Transaction is iterated for 50000 times. At the end of the iterations memory leakage is observed. 32% memory is occupied by org.wildfly.transaction.client.provider.remoting.TransactionClientChannel.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in the JBoss client-side when the UserTransaction is repeatedly used without proper resource cleanup.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory Leak",
         "Improper Resource Management"
      ],
      "impact": "The memory leak can lead to excessive memory consumption on the client-side, potentially causing performance degradation, application instability, or denial-of-service conditions. Information leakage may also occur due to the increasing memory usage.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote client repeatedly using UserTransaction against a vulnerable EJB server"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code that repeatedly uses the UserTransaction feature, typically as a remote client of a JBoss server.",
       "additional_details": "The issue is related to a failure to properly release resources associated with transaction channels. Specifically, the `org.wildfly.transaction.client.provider.remoting.TransactionClientChannel` is not being released correctly after a UserTransaction is committed."
