Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**1. Verification:**

The provided GitHub commit and Huntr.dev pages do not contain specific information regarding CVE-2022-0946. The GitHub commit shows a change to `AttachmentModel.class.php` which adds `htm` to a list of dangerous file extensions, and there is no mention of CVE-2022-0946 in the provided Huntr.dev content.

**2. Analysis:**

The GitHub commit introduces a change to `server/Application/Api/Model/AttachmentModel.class.php` in the `star7th/showdoc` repository.
- **Root cause:** The commit adds the `.htm` file extension to the list of dangerous file extensions, suggesting a potential security concern. The code snippet is within the `isDangerFilename` function, implying that this function checks if a filename is potentially dangerous.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The addition of `.htm` suggests that files with this extension might be used for malicious purposes, likely through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if uploaded and served through the application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If an attacker can upload an HTML file with malicious JavaScript code, they might be able to execute XSS attacks when users access or interact with the uploaded file through the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through file upload functionality. Specifically uploading an HTML file with a `.htm` extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the application.

**3. Additional Notes:**
  - The specific reason for adding .htm might indicate that there is a discovered vulnerability with handling of such files in the application and that adding the extension to the dangerous list is meant to prevent an exploit.
  - The context indicates that this is part of a file upload feature.

**Conclusion:**

The provided content, specifically the GitHub commit, indicates a potential security issue related to the processing of `.htm` files. However, it **does not** directly provide information about **CVE-2022-0946**. It reveals a vulnerability in the file upload mechanism, where uploading an `.htm` file could result in an XSS vulnerability. Since there's no mention of CVE-2022-0946, it can't be said that the commit is related.
