- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Cortex XSOAR engine software due to insufficient verification of data authenticity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software allows a local attacker with shell access to execute programs with elevated privileges due to a flaw in data authenticity verification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker with shell access can gain elevated privileges on the affected system, potentially leading to complete compromise of the Cortex XSOAR engine. This includes high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack vector. The attacker needs shell access on the Linux system where the affected Cortex XSOAR engine is installed using the shell method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires local shell access to the Cortex XSOAR engine running on a Linux system. The vulnerability is only applicable to installations done through the shell method. Additionally, the attacker needs high privileges, meaning they need to be an administrator on the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
