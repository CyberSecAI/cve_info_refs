- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper link resolution before file access in the Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect app on Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-59, which is "Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ('Link Following')". This means the application does not properly validate or handle symbolic links, allowing for potential manipulation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can disrupt system processes and potentially execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is LOCAL, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable Windows system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges on the target Windows system and can leverage the vulnerability with no user interaction. The attack complexity is HIGH.
