Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of the `selected_icons` attribute within the `cnss_widget` before it's used in an SQL query. This allows for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically in the `selected_icons` parameter, which is passed unsanitized to an SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** An attacker can extract sensitive data from the WordPress database, such as user credentials.
- **Potential for further compromise:** Successful SQL injection can allow attackers to potentially gain further access and control of the application/server. The provided proof of concept extracts the user passwords hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the WordPress admin panel where an admin user can add/edit widget configurations.
- The specific vulnerable parameter is `widget-cnss_widget[number_id][selected_icons][]`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Administrator Access:** The attacker must have administrator-level access to the WordPress dashboard to add or modify widgets.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameter to inject malicious SQL code.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates a UNION-based SQL injection to extract user password hashes from the `wp_users` table.
- The vulnerability is located in the `Easy Social Icons` plugin versions prior to 3.1.4.
- The vulnerable SQL query is:
`SELECT * FROM wp_cn_social_icon WHERE image_url<>'' AND url<>'' AND `id` IN({payload}) ORDER BY sortorder`
- The `selected_icons` parameter content is inserted in place of `{payload}` without sanitization.
