  "CVE-2022-0168": {
    "Description": "The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux operating system.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* kernel: smb2_ioctl_query_info NULL pointer dereference (CVE-2022-0168)",
    "Root cause": "The `smb2_ioctl_query_info` function does not correctly verify the return from the `memdup_user` function, leading to a NULL pointer dereference if a user-controlled `output_buffer_length` is equal to zero.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of return values from memdup_user leading to potential null pointer dereference.",
       "Lack of input validation for a user provided size."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, privileged (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) attacker can crash the system.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` capabilities can trigger the vulnerability via a crafted ioctl call on a mounted cifs filesystem.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` privileges."
  }
