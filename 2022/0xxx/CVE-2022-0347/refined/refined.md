- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize the `redirect-page` parameter before outputting it in an attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: A crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code in the `redirect-page` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to entice a user to click on the crafted link. No specific privileges are required.
