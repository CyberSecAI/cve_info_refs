Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0411:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `post_id` parameter before its use in an SQL query within the Asgaros Forum plugin. This occurs through a REST route, which is accessible to any authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a Blind SQL Injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `post_id` parameter to manipulate database queries, potentially extracting sensitive data or altering the database structure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data Exfiltration: The provided proof of concept uses a `SLEEP` command demonstrating that an attacker could exfiltrate sensitive data via time based SQL injection. 
- Unauthorized Database Access: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read arbitrary data, modify data or in severe cases, potentially take over the database.
- The CVSS score indicates a high severity, emphasizing the significant potential for damage.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- It utilizes a REST API endpoint (`/asgaros-forum/v1/reaction/1/hello`).
- The vulnerable parameter is `post_id` which is sent through a POST request body.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker only needs to be an authenticated user (Subscriber+).
- No other special privileges are required.
- The attacker would need to know/discover the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the reaction functionality of the Asgaros Forum plugin.
- The issue was fixed in version 2.0.0 of the plugin, with the commit [2669226](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2669226/asgaros-forum) resolving this SQL injection.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).

This information provides a comprehensive picture of the vulnerability, its cause, how it can be exploited, and its potential impact, all in line with the CVE description.
