Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient check on filenames during file uploads. Specifically, the `upload` function in `AttachmentModel.class.php` was initially missing a check for the filename extension against an allowed list during file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The original code did not perform filename validation, allowing users to upload files with arbitrary extensions.
- **Filename Extension Whitelist Bypass:** The code implemented a whitelist approach using  `isAllowedFilename` to only allow certain file extensions.
- **Lack of Default Validation:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the filename check (`$check_filename`) was initially not enabled by default. It was an optional parameter to `upload` function. 

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially upload malicious files with executable extensions (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, etc) by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Server Compromise:** By exploiting the ability to upload arbitrary file types, attackers could achieve Remote Code Execution on the server, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload Form:** An attacker would typically leverage an application's file upload functionality to upload a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, since the `upload` function has parameters for `uid`.
- **File Upload Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a part of the application that uses the vulnerable `upload` function for file uploads.

**Additional Information:**

- The fix implemented by commit `3caa323` addresses this issue by adding `$check_filename = true` as a default parameter in the `upload` function.
- The commit also removes unnecessary entries in the whitelist array.
- The commit changes the function from `isDangerFilename` to `isAllowedFilename`, and enforces filename extension check against whitelist.
- The code changes show the following :
   - The addition of `$check_filename = true` to the function signature in `public function upload($\_files , $file\_key , $uid , $item\_id = 0 , $page\_id = 0 , $check\_filename = true  )` to enable file name check by default.
   - A change in the function name from `isDangerFilename` to `isAllowedFilename`.
   - Removal of duplicated extensions and some uncommon ones from the array in `isAllowedFilename` function.
