- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `num_of_pages` parameter is not sanitized or escaped before being output in the response of the `themify_create_popup_page_pagination` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page, which can then be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can craft a malicious POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=themify_create_popup_page_pagination` with the `num_of_pages` parameter containing a malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an HTTP POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The vulnerability is available to any authenticated user.
