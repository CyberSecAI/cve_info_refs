Based on the provided diff, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `upload` function within the `AttachmentModel.class.php` file.
- Prior to the fix, the filename check using `isAllowedFilename` was not consistently enforced. Specifically, it was skipped under certain conditions when `$check_filename` was not explicitly passed as `true` to the `upload` function, thus bypassing the allowed file extensions check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The primary weakness is the potential for unrestricted file uploads due to the conditional execution of the `isAllowedFilename` function. If `$check_filename` is not explicitly set to `true` when calling `upload`, any file, regardless of its extension, could be uploaded.
- **Inconsistent Filename Checking:** The code initially lacked consistency in applying filename validation, leading to the bypass of file extension checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading malicious files with extensions not listed in the allow list (e.g., `.php`, `.jsp`, `.py`, etc), an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Uploading HTML files or other files with malicious script could lead to XSS attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of users.
- **System Compromise:** Through these attack vectors, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire server, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload Form:** The attacker would need to utilize the file upload form to upload files to the server. The vulnerability resides in the server-side processing of this file upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to File Upload Functionality:** The attacker needs the ability to interact with the file upload functionality of the system. This could be public facing or behind an authentication boundary.
- **Understanding of Bypass Conditions:** An attacker needs to be aware that the filename check can be bypassed if  `$check_filename` is not passed as true when the upload function is invoked.

**Technical Details:**

- The commit introduces a change in the `upload` function signature by adding the `$check_filename = true` argument, which defaults the filename check to be enforced, thus preventing the bypass.

**Summary**
This commit fixes an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in `showdoc` by ensuring the `isAllowedFilename` check is consistently enforced during file uploads. The missing default value of `$check_filename` in the upload function allowed attackers to bypass the file extension check.
