  "summary": "The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in `AKPublic.Verify`, which allows a local attacker to provide a maliciously-formed TPM Quote with inconsistent PCR values. This can be combined with a maliciously-crafted TCG log in `Eventlog.Verify` to spoof events, bypassing measured-boot attestation.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation in `AKPublic.Verify` allows a maliciously formed TPM Quote with no or some PCRs to pass verification, despite inconsistencies.",

      "CWE-20 Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker can spoof events in the TCG log, defeating remotely-attested measured-boot by combining the vulnerability with a maliciously crafted TCG log in `Eventlog.Verify`.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access is required to provide the malicious TPM quote."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system running go-attestation and needs to be able to supply a manipulated TPM quote and TCG log."
