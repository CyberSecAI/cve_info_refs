The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0769.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape the `data_target` parameter before it is used in an SQL query. This allows for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- Improper input sanitization/escaping

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (accessing sensitive information)
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    - Complete compromise of the database server

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP request to `admin-ajax.php` with a malicious `data_target` parameter within the `rating_vote` action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
