Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0589:

**CVE-2022-0589**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in multiple areas of the LibreNMS application. Specifically, the application doesn't adequately sanitize input when creating/modifying Transport Groups, adding/editing Services, and editing Service Templates.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application fails to sanitize user-provided data, which can then be stored and later executed in the context of other users' browsers.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the affected fields. This code is then executed when other users interact with the modified content, potentially leading to various malicious activities. The impact includes:
    *   **Data theft:** Stealing session cookies or other sensitive information.
    *   **Account compromise:** Taking over user accounts.
    *   **Malware distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or forcing them to download malware.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker would need to:
    1.  Log in to the LibreNMS application.
    2.  Navigate to the vulnerable areas: creating/modifying Transport Groups, adding/editing Services, or editing Service Templates.
    3.  Input malicious JavaScript code within the appropriate fields (e.g. the 'name' field of the Transport Groups form)
    4.  The malicious script gets stored in the database.
    5.  When another user views this stored data, the injected javascript is executed.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a valid user account with at least the "normal" user role/level in the LibreNMS application.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access and modify the vulnerable components of the application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided github commit (4c9d4eefd8064a0285f9718ef38f5617d7f9d6fa) shows the code changes made to address the XSS vulnerability. The fix involves sanitizing user input in the following files using `strip_tags()`:
    *   `includes/html/forms/add-dashboard.inc.php` (dashboard\_name input)
    *   `includes/html/forms/customoid.inc.php` (name, oid and datatype inputs)
    *   `includes/html/forms/transport-groups.inc.php` (name input)
*   The vulnerability was discovered on Feb 13th 2022 and patched in version 22.2.0.
*   The advisory assigns a Medium severity to this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS vector provided is `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L`.
