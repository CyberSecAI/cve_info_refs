- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the text to hover.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability exists because user-provided text input for the hover effect is not properly sanitized or escaped before being displayed on the website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high privilege user can inject malicious JavaScript code that will execute in the browsers of other users when they interact with the affected content (e.g. hover over specific text). This can lead to a variety of malicious actions like redirecting users to malicious websites, stealing session cookies, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with admin-level access can insert malicious JavaScript code through the plugin settings panel. The malicious script will be executed when a user hovers over text that contains the attacker's malicious payload in comments or posts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin-level access to the WordPress site to modify the plugin settings.
