The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0320.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin does not properly validate and sanitize template data before using it in include statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server.
- Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) via techniques such as exploiting user-uploaded files or other LFI-to-RCE methods.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unauthenticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint when the "Load More" button for the Post Grid widget is enabled
- The `template_info[file_name]` parameter, and `template_info[name]`, is vulnerable.
- The `ajax_eael_product_gallery` AJAX action (Product Grid widget) is also affected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and how to send the crafted request to trigger the LFI vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the webpage where the vulnerable widget is used.
