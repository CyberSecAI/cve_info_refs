Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a missing authorization check in the REST API endpoint for adding members to a group when LDAP group sync is enabled. Specifically, when a GitLab group is linked to an LDAP group, the UI correctly prevents manual addition of users to the group. However, the API endpoint lacks this restriction.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Authorization Enforcement:** The UI correctly enforces authorization rules related to LDAP group sync, while the API endpoint for adding group members does not. This allows bypassing UI restrictions by using the API.
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The core vulnerability lies in the API endpoint's failure to verify whether adding a non-LDAP user is permitted when an LDAP group link exists for the target group.
*   **Potential for unauthorized access:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to be added to the group.
*   **Inability to remove the user:** After adding a non-LDAP user to the group, it is impossible to remove them via the API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could add arbitrary users to a group that is intended to be managed by LDAP sync, potentially granting unauthorized access to resources and data within that group.
*   **Data Breach:** Depending on the permissions of the added users, this could lead to data breaches or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Disruption of Group Management:** The inability to remove added users through API causes disruptions in group management.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Abuse:** The primary attack vector is direct use of the GitLab API, specifically the endpoint for adding group members, `https://gitlab.local/api/v4/groups/61/members`.
*   **Bypassing UI Restrictions:** The attacker bypasses the UI restriction by directly using the API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid GitLab account and a valid `PRIVATE-TOKEN` to use the API.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs knowledge of the API endpoint for adding group members.
*   **Knowledge of Group ID:** The attacker needs to know the group ID to target for adding a member.
*   **Knowledge of User ID:** The attacker needs the user ID of the user to be added to the group.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was reproduced in GitLab 14.3.
*   The DELETE action is not permitted via API, this may be due to a bug or a hidden authorization check. This is good but requires further examination.
*   The issue has potential security implications and should be handled confidentially.
*   The report suggests investigating similar GraphQL endpoints for the same vulnerability.
*   The issue is related to LDAP group sync, meaning the vulnerability exists only if LDAP group sync is enabled and the target group is linked to an LDAP group.
