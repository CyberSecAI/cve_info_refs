- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `wahi` parameter before outputting its base64 decoded value in the page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a webpage, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted URL with a malicious base64 encoded payload in the `wahi` parameter. For example: `https://example.com/?wahi=JzthbGVydCgxKTsvLw==`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be able to craft a URL. No special user privileges are required.
