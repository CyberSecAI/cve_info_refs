The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0840.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The plugin "Easy Social Icons" does not properly escape the `image_file` field when adding a new social icon.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient escaping of the `image_file` field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- An authenticated user with admin privileges can inject malicious JavaScript through the `image_file` field when adding or editing a social icon.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be logged into the WordPress admin panel with at least admin privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the social icon management page within the WordPress admin panel.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in versions of "Easy Social Icons" before 3.2.1.
- Version 3.2.0 partially addressed some of the issues but was still vulnerable when editing the contaminated icon.
- The vulnerability is classified as a stored XSS, meaning the malicious code is stored in the database and executed when other users access the affected page.
