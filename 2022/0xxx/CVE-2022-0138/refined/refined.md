**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the affected product's deserialization function, which does not validate or check the data, allowing arbitrary classes to be created.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Deserialization of untrusted data (CWE-502). The lack of validation on deserialized data allows the creation of arbitrary classes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation allows attackers to modify data, which would lead to integrity compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack.
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely with low complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable API endpoint.
