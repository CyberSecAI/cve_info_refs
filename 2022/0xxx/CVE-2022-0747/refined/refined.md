Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `post_id` parameter within the `qcld_upvote_action` AJAX action. The plugin directly uses this parameter in a SQL query without casting it to an integer or properly sanitizing it, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (SQLI):** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `post_id` parameter.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerable `qcld_upvote_action` AJAX action is accessible to both unauthenticated and authenticated users, making exploitation easier.
*   **Improper Sanitization:** The code uses `sanitize_text_field`, which is insufficient to prevent SQL injection in this context because it is still used directly in a query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker might be able to modify or delete data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Through SQL injection, an attacker can potentially cause a DoS by making the server unresponsive via heavy SQL queries (e.g. using `SLEEP()`).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `qcld_upvote_action` and a malicious `post_id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any user account or privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. They can exploit it anonymously.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the WordPress site to send the crafted HTTP request.

**Additional Details from the Provided Content:**

*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** The provided `curl` command demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability using a time-based SQL injection (using `SLEEP(5)`), confirming the SQL injection.
*   **Affected Plugin:** The vulnerability affects the "Infographic Maker - iList" plugin versions prior to 4.3.8.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.3.8 by casting the `post_id` to an integer using `absint()`. The patch also uses `isset()` to check that the POST parameters exist, adding a layer of safety.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6 (High).
*   **OWASP Category:** The vulnerability falls under the OWASP Top 10 category A1: Injection.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command).
*   **Patch Details:** The code diff shows that the vulnerable code using `~~trim(sanitize_text_field($_POST['post_id']))~~` was replaced with `isset($_POST['post_id']) ? absint(sanitize_text_field($_POST['post_id'])) : ''`. The `absint()` function ensures that the `post_id` is always an integer, mitigating the SQL injection risk.

In summary, the vulnerability is an unauthenticated SQL injection due to improper handling of user-supplied input in a database query, which can be exploited easily to cause data exposure, manipulation, or DoS, highlighting the need for proper sanitization and input validation in web applications.
