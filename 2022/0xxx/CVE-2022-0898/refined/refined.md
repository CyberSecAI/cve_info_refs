Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-0898:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the plugin's failure to properly sanitize and escape certain input fields when high-privilege users lack the `unfiltered_html` capability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings.
- The injected script will execute in the context of other users' browsers when they preview the template or when the "Enable Coming Soon or Site Offline" option is enabled and the frontend is accessed.
- This could lead to various malicious activities, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious payload using `<script>` tags.
- The payload is injected into the "Paragraph Text" or "Descriptive Text" fields when customizing a template within the plugin's admin interface ( `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=cscs_templates` ).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have administrator privileges or similar high privileges to access and customize the plugin's templates.
- The target users must preview the template or access the frontend while the "Enable Coming Soon or Site Offline" option is enabled for the XSS to be triggered.
