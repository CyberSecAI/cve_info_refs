- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability exists in a kernel module of ESET's business and server products for Linux.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service condition on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The advisory doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but it indicates the vulnerability can be triggered remotely (AV:N), with high complexity (AC:H), without requiring privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to send network traffic to the affected machine, and would need a complex method for exploiting the use-after-free condition.
