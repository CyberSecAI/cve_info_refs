- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Link field, allowing users to inject malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: By inserting a malicious script into the "Link" field of the plugin's settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges to modify the plugin's settings. The vulnerability can be exploited even when the `unfiltered_html` capability is disallowed, meaning it bypasses some common protections against XSS.
