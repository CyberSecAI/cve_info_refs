Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0190:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `id` parameter within the `delete` action of the "Ad Invalid Click Protector" plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The plugin is vulnerable to SQL injection, specifically within the `id` parameter of the `delete` action. This vulnerability arises from not sanitizing user input before using it in a SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   This can lead to unauthorized data access, data modification, or data deletion.
*   The specific impact could depend on the database permissions and the attacker's goals.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the `wp-admin/admin.php` interface, specifically when accessing the page `aicp_banned_user_details` and using the `delete` action.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with the capability to access the `aicp_banned_user_details` page and trigger the `delete` action. This is indicated by the CVSS score requiring high privileges.
*   The attacker can inject malicious SQL code via the `id` parameter in the HTTP request.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) illustrates the vulnerability:
`http://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/admin.php?page=aicp_banned_user_details&action=delete&id=0)%20OR%201=1%20--%20k`
This crafted URL demonstrates how an attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter to inject SQL code (`OR 1=1`) which will be executed by the database.
The SQL Injection vulnerability is classified as CWE-89.
The CVSS score is 4.7 (Medium) with the following vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L`.
The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.6 of the plugin.
