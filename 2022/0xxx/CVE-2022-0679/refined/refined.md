- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to validate and sanitize the `lib_path` parameter before it is passed to the `require()` function via the `narnoo_distributor_lib_request` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.
    - Unsanitized input leading to arbitrary file read.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Disclosure of arbitrary files.
    - Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on system configuration and available files.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `narnoo_distributor_lib_request` and the `lib_path` parameter pointing to a file on the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
