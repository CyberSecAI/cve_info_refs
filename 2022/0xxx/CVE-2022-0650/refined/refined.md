- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer within the httpd service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of root on the affected TP-Link TL-WR940N router.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-adjacent attackers can exploit the vulnerability through the httpd service which listens on TCP port 80.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to be on the same network as the router and must be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
