Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when creating comments and ratings on videos. Specifically, the code did not consistently check if a user had permission to access a video before allowing them to comment or rate it. This primarily affected private videos where users should not be able to interact if they are not authorized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization Checks:** The main weakness is the absence of consistent checks (`checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate`) to determine if the user has the necessary permissions to view a video before allowing them to create comments or rate the video.
*   **Missing Private Video Checks:**  The code was missing checks to prevent unauthorized users from commenting or rating private videos they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Private Video Interactions:** An attacker could potentially create comments or rates on private videos that they are not authorized to view, potentially revealing information or impacting the video owner's experience.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API requests:** By crafting requests directly to the API endpoints for adding comments or ratings, an attacker could bypass the intended authorization checks and interact with private videos.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **API access:** The attacker must be able to make requests to the PeerTube API.
*   **Knowledge of video IDs:** The attacker would need to know or guess the IDs of private videos they wish to interact with without authorization.
*   **User Authentication (potentially):** Although the vulnerability allows access to private video interactions, the attacker still needs to be authenticated to the platform.

**Details from the Commit:**
The commit addresses this by adding `checkCanSeeVideoIfPrivate` checks in the following files:

*   `server/middlewares/validators/videos/video-comments.ts` (for comment creation and replies)
*   `server/middlewares/validators/videos/video-rates.ts` (for video ratings)
*   `server/tests/api/check-params/video-comments.ts` (Added test cases for private video comments).
*   `server/tests/api/check-params/videos.ts` (Added test cases for private video rates).

The added code checks if the current user has permission to view the video, returning a `403 Forbidden` error if they don't.

The commit message "Check video privacy when creating comments/rates" further confirms that this commit addresses a privacy-related authorization issue.
