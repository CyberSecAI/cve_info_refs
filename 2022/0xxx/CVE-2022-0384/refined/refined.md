Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0384:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization checks in the `vczapi_get_wp_users` AJAX action within the "Video Conferencing with Zoom" WordPress plugin. This allowed any authenticated user, including those with minimal privileges like "subscriber," to access and trigger this action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `vczapi_get_wp_users` AJAX action directly exposes a list of email addresses without proper authorization.
*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The plugin failed to implement a check to verify if the user has the required privileges (e.g., `manage_options`) to access this action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** An attacker, by simply being a subscriber on a vulnerable WordPress site, could obtain the email addresses of all registered users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **AJAX Action:** Attackers send a request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action=vczapi_get_wp_users` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site. The account can have very low privileges, such as a "subscriber" role.

**Additional Details from the provided content**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.8.17 of the plugin by adding a permission check to the `get_wp_usersByRole()` function that is called by the AJAX action. The fix specifically checks if the current user has the `manage_options` capability before proceeding.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Krzysztof ZajÄ…c.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a Sensitive Data Disclosure and aligns with OWASP Top 10 A3: Sensitive Data Exposure and CWE-200.
* The CVSS score for the vulnerability is 6.5 (Medium).
