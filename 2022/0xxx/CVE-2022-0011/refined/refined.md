- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from how PAN-OS software handles URL category exceptions, specifically when using custom URL category lists or External Dynamic Lists (EDLs) in URL filtering profiles. When a hostname pattern in these lists doesn't end with a forward slash (/) or an asterisk (*), the system interprets any URL that *starts* with the specified pattern as a match. Additionally, a caret (^) at the end of a hostname pattern matches any top-level domain.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The weakness lies in the overly broad matching logic used for URL exceptions. Instead of requiring exact matches or using proper wildcard handling, the system considers any URL starting with the specified pattern as a match which leads to unintended bypass of URL filtering policies.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is primarily a compromise of integrity. This vulnerability allows more URLs than intended to be either allowed or blocked. If URLs are unexpectedly allowed, this represents a security risk.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the network. An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability by leveraging URL patterns that cause unexpected matching and bypass intended security controls.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be in a position to influence the URL traffic through the firewall. Low privileges are required. This vulnerability can be exploited by creating malicious hostnames that are substrings of exception list patterns.
