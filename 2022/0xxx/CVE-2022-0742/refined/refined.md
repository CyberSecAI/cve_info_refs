Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   A memory leak vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's IPv6 multicast implementation, specifically within the `igmp6_event_query()` and `igmp6_event_report()` functions.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `f185de28d9ae`, which added new workqueues for processing MLD (Multicast Listener Discovery) events.
*   The issue stems from incorrect handling of socket buffer (`sk_buff`) drops in the mentioned functions. Under certain conditions, these functions could drop `sk_buffs` without freeing them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Memory Leak:** The primary vulnerability is a memory leak caused by dropped socket buffers. The `igmp6_event_query()` and `igmp6_event_report()` functions might drop `sk_buffs` in some cases without freeing the associated memory.
*   **Incorrect skb Handling:**  The code was not properly managing skb leading to memory leak and eventual exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service. By flooding the target system with ICMPv6 messages of types 130 (MLD Query) or 131 (MLD Report), an attacker can cause the kernel to leak memory until the host runs out of memory and becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based.
*   **ICMPv6 Flooding:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a large number of ICMPv6 messages of type 130 or 131.
*   **Low traffic volume required:** The amount of traffic required to exploit the vulnerability does not need to be particularly high.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the target system.
*   **ICMPv6 Packet Sending:** The attacker must be able to send ICMPv6 packets of type 130 (MLD Query) or 131 (MLD Report).

**Affected Versions:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version 5.13 and affected versions up to 5.16.
*   Specifically, Linux kernel versions 5.13 to 5.16 are mentioned as susceptible, with 5.15's stable branch being directly affected.

**Mitigation:**
* The vulnerability is fixed in the Linux kernel by commit `2d3916f3189172d5c69d33065c3c21119fe539fc`, which landed in upstream.
* The fix has been backported to:
   * v5.16.13
   * v5.15.27

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and fixed by Eric Dumazet.
*   NetApp products incorporating vulnerable versions of the Linux kernel are also affected. Specific products affected are:
    *   FAS/AFF Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - 8300/8700/A400/C400
    *   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S
    *   NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C
