Subject: CVE-2022-0742: Remote Denial of Service on Linux Kernel >=5.13 icmp6

Flooding icmp6 messages of type 130 or 131 is enough to exploit a
memory leak in the kernel and cause the host to go out-of-memory. The
volume of traffic doesn't need to be particularly high. Note that
since the vulnerability was introduced recently (5.13) only 5.15's
stable was affected.

This vulnerability was found/fixed by Eric Dumazet.

CVE will land on MITRE's website sometime this week.

This was fixed on <https://kernel.dance/2d3916f3189172d5c69d33065c3c21119fe539fc>

ipv6: fix skb drops in igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()
While investigating on why a synchronize_net() has been added recently
in ipv6_mc_down(), I found that igmp6_event_query() and igmp6_event_report()
might drop skbs in some cases.

Discussion about removing synchronize_net() from ipv6_mc_down()
will happen in a different thread.
