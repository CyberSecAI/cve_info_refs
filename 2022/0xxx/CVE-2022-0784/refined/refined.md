- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `id` parameter before using it in a SQL statement via the `wpex_titles` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `wpex_titles` and a malicious `id` parameter. This action is available to unauthenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress instance.
