- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `code` parameter before outputting it back in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to various attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `code` parameter and tricking a user (admin) to click on it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious payload, and then trick a user (admin) of the website to visit this URL.
