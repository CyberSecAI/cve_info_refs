Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a change in the `api_expose` function call in the `src/MicroweberPackages/User/helpers/api_user.php` file.
- Specifically, the function `users/search_authors` was originally exposed without requiring admin privileges.
- The commit modifies the exposure of this function to `api_expose_admin`, meaning it now requires admin-level access to be executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) / Privilege Escalation (Potential):** Before the fix, the `users/search_authors` API endpoint was accessible to any user without admin rights. This could potentially allow an attacker to retrieve author information without proper authorization. This is because `search_authors` likely returns more data than intended for non-admin users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially enumerate and extract sensitive information about users considered authors without admin level access. This information might include usernames, email addresses, or other associated data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Call:** An attacker could directly call the vulnerable API endpoint `users/search_authors` using crafted HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Any Authenticated User:**  Before the fix, a user would only need to be authenticated to call the endpoint, regardless of the access level.
- **Network Access:** An attacker would require network access to the Microweber application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content shows the specific commit that fixes this issue by changing `api_expose` to `api_expose_admin`. This means only admin users will have access to the `users/search_authors` function.
- The vulnerability was in the way the `users/search_authors` function was exposed, allowing unauthorized access.
- The patch limits access to the `search_authors` function to admin users only.
