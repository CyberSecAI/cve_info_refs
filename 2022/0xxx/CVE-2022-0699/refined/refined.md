Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0699:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free in the `split()` function within `contrib/shpsort.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- A buffer named `copy` is freed twice.
    - The first free occurs at line 107 of `shpsort.c`.
    - If `realloc()` fails at line 110, the same buffer `copy` is freed again at line 116.
- This double-free condition can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The double-free can lead to an attacker potentially gaining control over values returned from `malloc()`.
- This control can enable:
    - Disclosure of sensitive data (bypassing safety features).
    - Hostile code execution.
- The vulnerability can lead to denial of service.
- The CVSS score indicates high impact across confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based.
- Attack complexity is low.
- No privileges or user interaction is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction.
- An attacker can be remote to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects shapelib version 1.5.0 and older releases.
- The issue was reported in GitHub issue #39.
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `c75b9281a5b9452d92e1682bdfe6019a13ed819f` by removing the redundant free at line 116.
