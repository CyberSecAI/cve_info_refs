| Summary The buffer `copy` is freed twice, leading to possible memory corruption or vulnerability. Cause In `split()`, at [shpsort.c:107](https://github.com/OSGeo/shapelib/blob/21ae8fc16afa15a1b723077b6cec3a9abc592f6a/contrib/shpsort.c#L107), the buffer `copy` is free'd. `realloc()` fails on line 110, the buffer `copy` is freed again at [shpsort.c:116](https://github.com/OSGeo/shapelib/blob/21ae8fc16afa15a1b723077b6cec3a9abc592f6a/contrib/shpsort.c#L116). Impact A double-free bug can lead to an attacker gaining control over the values returned from `malloc()`, which in turn may allow both disclosure of sensitive data (e.g. bypassing additional safety features) or in the worst case hostile code execution. Vulnerable version  * contrib/shpsort (commit [21ae8fc](https://github.com/OSGeo/shapelib/commit/21ae8fc16afa15a1b723077b6cec3a9abc592f6a))  Proposed mitigation Remove line 116, as it is redundant. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
