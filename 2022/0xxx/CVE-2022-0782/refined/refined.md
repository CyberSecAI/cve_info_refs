- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `nd_donations_id` parameter is not sanitized or escaped before being used in a SQL query within the `nd_donations_single_cause_form_validate_fields_php_function` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary code on the database server by injecting malicious SQL commands.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is reachable via an AJAX action (`nd_donations_single_cause_form_validate_fields_php_function`) available to unauthenticated users. The attacker can send a crafted request containing malicious SQL in the `nd_donations_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
