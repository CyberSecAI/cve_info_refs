  "CVE-2022-0071": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hot patch solutions invoked container binaries without properly containerizing them, leading to the container processes running without the limitations normally applied to containers (such as cgroups and seccomp). They also ran as root regardless of the container's user.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The hot patch solutions did not properly isolate container processes, allowing for resource exhaustion, device modification, and syscall execution that would normally be blocked. Processes spawned by the hotpatch ran with elevated privileges.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Containers could escape their boundaries and compromise the underlying host. Unprivileged processes could escalate privileges to gain root code execution. This could lead to full system compromise.",
      "Attack vectors": "A malicious container or process that includes a binary named 'java' could trick the hot patch service into invoking it with elevated privileges, which could then be used to escape the container or elevate privileges on the host.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have the ability to deploy a container or run an unprivileged process on a system with a vulnerable hot patch installed."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hot patch solutions were not mimicking resource limits, device restrictions, or syscall filters of the target JVM process.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper isolation for processes invoked by the hot patch. This allowed the processes to bypass normal container restrictions.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation could lead to resource exhaustion on the host, modification of devices, and the execution of normally blocked syscalls.",
       "Attack vectors": "By creating a malicious binary named 'java', a container or unprivileged process could trick the hot patch solution into running it with elevated permissions, thus facilitating exploitation.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to deploy a container or run a process on a system where the vulnerable hot patch is installed."
