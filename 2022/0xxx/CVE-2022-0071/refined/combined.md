Linux namespaces provide isolation for running processes, limiting their access
to system resources without the running process being aware of the limitations.
For more information on Linux namespaces, see
[Linux namespaces](https://www.linux.com/news/understanding-and-securing-linux-namespaces).

The best way to prevent privilege-escalation attacks from within a container is
to configure your container's applications to run as unprivileged users. For
containers whose processes must run as the `root` user within the container, you
can re-map this user to a less-privileged user on the Docker host. The mapped
user is assigned a range of UIDs which function within the namespace as normal
UIDs from 0 to 65536, but have no privileges on the host machine itself.

## [About remapping and subordinate user and group IDs](#about-remapping-and-subordinate-user-and-group-ids)

The remapping itself is handled by two files: `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`.
Each file works the same, but one is concerned with the user ID range, and the
other with the group ID range. Consider the following entry in `/etc/subuid`:

```
testuser:231072:65536
```

This means that `testuser` is assigned a subordinate user ID range of `231072`
and the next 65536 integers in sequence. UID `231072` is mapped within the
namespace (within the container, in this case) as UID `0` (`root`). UID `231073`
is mapped as UID `1`, and so forth. If a process attempts to escalate privilege
outside of the namespace, the process is running as an unprivileged high-number
UID on the host, which does not even map to a real user. This means the process
has no privileges on the host system at all.

> **Note**
>
>
>
> It is possible to assign multiple subordinate ranges for a given user or group
> by adding multiple non-overlapping mappings for the same user or group in the

When you configure Docker to use the `userns-remap` feature, you can optionally
specify an existing user and/or group, or you can specify `default`. If you
specify `default`, a user and group `dockremap` is created and used for this
purpose.

> [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

It is very important that the ranges do not overlap, so that a process cannot gain
access in a different namespace. On most Linux distributions, system utilities
manage the ranges for you when you add or remove users.

This re-mapping is transparent to the container, but introduces some
configuration complexity in situations where the container needs access to
resources on the Docker host, such as bind mounts into areas of the filesystem
that the system user cannot write to. From a security standpoint, it is best to
avoid these situations.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

1. The subordinate UID and GID ranges must be associated with an existing user,
   even though the association is an implementation detail. The user owns
   the namespaced storage directories under `/var/lib/docker/`. If you don't
   want to use an existing user, Docker can create one for you and use that. If
   you want to use an existing username or user ID, it must already exist.
   Typically, this means that the relevant entries need to be in
   `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`, but if you are using a different
   authentication back-end, this requirement may translate differently.

   To verify this, use the `id` command:

   ```
   $ id testuser
   uid=1001(testuser) gid=1001(testuser) groups=1001(testuser)

   ```
2. The way the namespace remapping is handled on the host is using two files,
   `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`. These files are typically managed
   automatically when you add or remove users or groups, but on some
   distributions, you may need to manage these files manually.

   Each file contains three fields: the username or ID of the user, followed by
   a beginning UID or GID (which is treated as UID or GID 0 within the namespace)
   and a maximum number of UIDs or GIDs available to the user. For instance,
   given the following entry:

   ```
   testuser:231072:65536
   ```

   This means that user-namespaced processes started by `testuser` are
   owned by host UID `231072` (which looks like UID `0` inside the
   namespace) through 296607 (231072 + 65536 - 1). These ranges should not overlap,
   to ensure that namespaced processes cannot access each other's namespaces.

   After adding your user, check `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` to see if your
   user has an entry in each. If not, you need to add it, being careful to
   avoid overlap.

   If you want to use the `dockremap` user automatically created by Docker,
   check for the `dockremap` entry in these files after
   configuring and restarting Docker.
3. If there are any locations on the Docker host where the unprivileged
   user needs to write, adjust the permissions of those locations
   accordingly. This is also true if you want to use the `dockremap` user
   automatically created by Docker, but you can't modify the
   permissions until after configuring and restarting Docker.
4. Enabling `userns-remap` effectively masks existing image and container
   layers, as well as other Docker objects within `/var/lib/docker/`. This is
   because Docker needs to adjust the ownership of these resources and actually
   stores them in a subdirectory within `/var/lib/docker/`. It is best to enable
   this feature on a new Docker installation rather than an existing one.

   Along the same lines, if you disable `userns-remap` you can't access any
   of the resources created while it was enabled.
5. Check the
   [limitations](#user-namespace-known-limitations) on user
   namespaces to be sure your use case is possible.

## [Enable userns-remap on the daemon](#enable-userns-remap-on-the-daemon)

You can start `dockerd` with the `--userns-remap` flag or follow this
procedure to configure the daemon using the `daemon.json` configuration file.
The `daemon.json` method is recommended. If you use the flag, use the following
command as a model:

```
$ dockerd --userns-remap="testuser:testuser"

```

1. Edit `/etc/docker/daemon.json`. Assuming the file was previously empty, the
   following entry enables `userns-remap` using user and group called
   `testuser`. You can address the user and group by ID or name. You only need to
   specify the group name or ID if it is different from the user name or ID. If
   you provide both the user and group name or ID, separate them by a colon
   (`:`) character. The following formats all work for the value, assuming
   the UID and GID of `testuser` are `1001`:

   * `testuser`
   * `testuser:testuser`
   * `1001`
   * `1001:1001`
   * `testuser:1001`
   * `1001:testuser`

   ```
   {
     "userns-remap": "testuser"
   }
   ```
   > **Note**
   >
   >
   >
   > To use the `dockremap` user and have Docker create it for you,
   > set the value to `default` rather than `testuser`.

   Save the file and restart Docker.
2. If you are using the `dockremap` user, verify that Docker created it using
   the `id` command.

   ```
   $ id dockremap
   uid=112(dockremap) gid=116(dockremap) groups=116(dockremap)

   ```

   Verify that the entry has been added to `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid`:

   ```
   $ grep dockremap /etc/subuid
   dockremap:231072:65536
   $ grep dockremap /etc/subgid
   dockremap:231072:65536

   ```

   If these entries are not present, edit the files as the `root` user and
   assign a starting UID and GID that is the highest-assigned one plus the
   offset (in this case, `65536`). Be careful not to allow any overlap in the
   ranges.
3. Verify that previous images are not available using the `docker image ls`
   command. The output should be empty.
4. Start a container from the `hello-world` image.

   ```
   $ docker run hello-world

   ```
5. Verify that a namespaced directory exists within `/var/lib/docker/` named
   with the UID and GID of the namespaced user, owned by that UID and GID,
   and not group-or-world-readable. Some of the subdirectories are still
   owned by `root` and have different permissions.

   ```
   $ sudo ls -ld /var/lib/docker/231072.231072/
   drwx------ 11 231072 231072 11 Jun 21 21:19 /var/lib/docker/231072.231072/
   $ sudo ls -l /var/lib/docker/231072.231072/
   total 14
   drwx------ 5 231072 231072 5 Jun 21 21:19 aufs
   drwx------ 3 231072 231072 3 Jun 21 21:21 containers
   drwx------ 3 root   root   3 Jun 21 21:19 image
   drwxr-x--- 3 root   root   3 Jun 21 21:19 network
   drwx------ 4 root   root   4 Jun 21 21:19 plugins
   drwx------ 2 root   root   2 Jun 21 21:19 swarm
   drwx------ 2 231072 231072 2 Jun 21 21:21 tmp
   drwx------ 2 root   root   2 Jun 21 21:19 trust
   drwx------ 2 231072 231072 3 Jun 21 21:19 volumes

   ```

   Your directory listing may have some differences, especially if you
   use a different container storage driver than `aufs`.

   The directories which are owned by the remapped user are used instead
   of the same directories directly beneath `/var/lib/docker/` and the
   unused versions (such as `/var/lib/docker/tmp/` in the example here)
   can be removed. Docker does not use them while `userns-remap` is
   enabled.

## [Disable namespace remapping for a container](#disable-namespace-remapping-for-a-container)

If you enable user namespaces on the daemon, all containers are started with
user namespaces enabled by default. In some situations, such as privileged
containers, you may need to disable user namespaces for a specific container.
See
[user namespace known limitations](#user-namespace-known-limitations)
for some of these limitations.

To disable user namespaces for a specific container, add the `--userns=host`
flag to the `docker container create`, `docker container run`, or `docker container exec` command.

There is a side effect when using this flag: user remapping will not be enabled for that container but, because the read-only (image) layers are shared between containers, ownership of the containers filesystem will still be remapped.

What this means is that the whole container filesystem will belong to the user specified in the `--userns-remap` daemon config (`231072` in the example above). This can lead to unexpected behavior of programs inside the container. For instance `sudo` (which checks that its binaries belong to user `0`) or binaries with a `setuid` flag.

## [User namespace known limitations](#user-namespace-known-limitations)

The following standard Docker features are incompatible with running a Docker
daemon with user namespaces enabled:

* Sharing PID or NET namespaces with the host (`--pid=host` or `--network=host`).
* External (volume or storage) drivers which are unaware or incapable of using
  daemon user mappings.
* Using the `--privileged` mode flag on `docker run` without also specifying
  `--userns=host`.

User namespaces are an advanced feature and require coordination with other
capabilities. For example, if volumes are mounted from the host, file ownership
must be pre-arranged if you need read or write access to the volume contents.

While the root user inside a user-namespaced container process has many of the
expected privileges of the superuser within the container, the Linux kernel
imposes restrictions based on internal knowledge that this is a user-namespaced
process. One notable restriction is the inability to use the `mknod` command.
Permission is denied for device creation within the container when run by
the `root` user.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

## **Executive Summary**

Following [Log4Shell](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/apache-log4j-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228/), AWS released several [hot patch solutions](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) that monitor for vulnerable Java applications and Java [containers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/advice-on-mitigating-the-apache-log4j-security-issue-for-eks-ecs-and-fargate-customers/) and patch them on the fly. Each solution suits a different environment, covering standalone servers, Kubernetes clusters, Elastic Container Service (ECS) clusters and Fargate. The hot patches aren't exclusive to AWS environments and can be installed onto any cloud or on-premises environment.

Unit 42 researchers identified severe security issues within these patching solutions and partnered with AWS to remediate them. After installing the patch service to a server or cluster, every container in that environment can exploit it to take over its underlying host. For example, if you [installed the hot patch to a Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent), every container in your cluster can now escape until you either disable the hot patch or upgrade to the fixed version. Aside from containers, unprivileged processes can also exploit the patch to escalate privileges and gain root code execution.

Containers can escape regardless of whether they run Java applications, or whether their underlying host runs [Bottlerocket](https://aws.amazon.com/bottlerocket/), AWS's hardened Linux distribution for containers. Containers running with [user namespaces](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) or as a non-root user are affected as well. Unit 42 assigned CVE-2021-3100, CVE-2021-3101, CVE-2022-0070 and CVE-2022-0071 to track the vulnerabilities.

AWS released a fixed version for each hot patch solution on April 19:

1. Version 1.1-16 of the log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch [package](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html), which bundles the hot patch service.
2. Version 1.1-16 of the kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent [Daemonset](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent), which installs the updated package.
3. Version 1.02 of [Hotdog](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog), a hot patch solution for Bottlerocket hosts based on Open Container Initiative (OCI) hooks.

Unit 42 advises anyone who installed any of these hot patches to upgrade to a fixed version. Note that starting from Dec. 17, 2021, JDK packages (Java installations) on Amazon Linux [automatically installed](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) the log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch package. Alternatively, users who are confident their applications are patched against Log4Shell can disable the hot patch service following the instructions in the Mitigations section below.

[Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud) detects the hot patch package and will alert on hosts running a vulnerable version.

## **Overview of AWS Log4Shell Hot Patches**

Log4Shell proved itself as one of the worst vulnerabilities of recent times. To help users combat the issue at scale, AWS open-sourced several hot patch solutions, each covering a different environment. Hot patching is the process of injecting a fix to a vulnerable running application. It's meant to serve as a short-term solution until a new, fixed version of the application can be deployed.

AWS released three hot patching solutions that detect processes and containers running vulnerable Java applications and patch them on the fly:

1. A [hot patch service](https://alas.aws.amazon.com/announcements/2021-001.html) bundled in an RPM package. Starting from Dec. 17, 2021, this service is automatically installed with Amazon Linux JDK (Java) packages. Fargate customers could've asked for this service to be installed on the hosts running their containers.
2. A [hot patch Daemonset](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent) for Kubernetes clusters, which installs the aforementioned hot patch service on all nodes.
3. [Hotdog](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog), a hot patch solution bundled as a set of OCI hooks. Hotdog is primarily intended for Bottlerocket hosts.

These solutions cover most compute environments, from Kubernetes clusters to ECS clusters, Fargate containers and standalone servers. They aren't exclusive to AWS environments, and can be installed onto other cloud environments or on-premises.

Unit 42 researchers discovered these patches can be exploited for container escape and privilege escalation. After any one of the patches is installed to a host or cluster, new containers can exploit the patch to escape and compromise their underlying host. On hosts that installed either the hot patch service or the hot patch Daemonset, existing containers can escape as well. Aside from containers, unprivileged processes can also exploit the patch service to escalate privileges and gain root code execution. AWS has now mitigated these vulnerabilities and released a fix for each solution.

## **Root Cause Analysis**

AWS's hot patch solutions continuously search for Java processes and patch them against Log4Shell on the fly. Any process running a binary named “java“ – inside or outside of a container – is considered a candidate for the hot patch.

To patch Java processes inside containers, the hot patch solutions invoke certain container binaries. For example, they run the container's "java" binary twice: once to retrieve the Java version, and again to inject the hot patch. The issue was that they invoked container binaries without properly containerizing them. That is, the new processes would run without the limitations normally applied to container processes.

For example, the "java" binary was invoked in the container namespaces via the [nsenter](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/nsenter.1.html) command (excluding the user namespace). But aside from that, it was spawned with all [Linux capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html), and without the [isolation technologies that normally confine containers](https://opensource.com/article/21/8/container-linux-technology), such as [seccomp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) and [cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html). It also ran as the root user regardless of the container's user.

A malicious container therefore could have included a malicious binary named “java” to trick the installed hot patch solution into invoking it with elevated privileges. The malicious “java” process could then abuse its elevated privileges to escape the container and take over the underlying host. The fixed hot patch solutions now properly containerize container binaires before running them.

Aside from containers, the hot patch service also patched host processes in a similar manner. A malicious unprivileged process could have created and run a malicious binary named "java" to trick the hot patch service into executing it with elevated privileges. The fixed hot patch service now spawns “java” binaries with the same privileges as the Java process being patched.

## **Container Escape Demo**

To verify the vulnerability is exploitable, we built a proof of concept (PoC) container image. When deployed to a cluster or VM that runs a vulnerable version of a hot patch solution, the container exploits the vulnerabilities to escape and gain root code execution on the underlying host. It then sends a [reverse shell](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/20-12/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/runtime_defense/incident_types/reverse_shell.html) to an attacker-controlled server.

In the demo video below, a user installed the hot patch Daemonset to an EKS cluster. The demo then simulates a supply chain attack by showing what happens when the user inadvertently runs a malicious container image that exploits the hot patch.

*Video 1. CVE-2021-3100 exploit demo.*

While the demo showcases a supply chain attack, existing containers that were compromised (e.g. by a network payload) can also exploit the issues to escape and take over their underlying host. We've decided not to share the exploit's implementation details at this time to prevent malicious parties from weaponizing it.

## **Impact**

Given the urgency surrounding Log4Shell, users may have deployed hot patches at scale, inadvertently putting container environments at risk. Even after Java applications were patched against Log4Shell, users may have kept the hot patch running for defense-in-depth as there isn't a strong incentive to remove it.

Containers are often used as a security boundary between applications running on the same machine. A container escape allows an attacker to extend a campaign beyond a single application and compromise neighboring services. In Kubernetes clusters, a single container escape is unfortunately sometimes enough to take over the entire cluster.

The issues are exploitable regardless of the container configuration, so even environments that enable advanced isolation techniques like running containers in [user namespaces](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/) or as a non-root user are affected.

Aside from containers, unprivileged processes could have also exploited the vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and gain full control over their underlying server.

## **Mitigations**

AWS released a fix for each hot patch solution. Once a host runs a fixed version, container escape and privilege escalation are no longer possible.

1. In Kubernetes clusters, you can install the fixed hot patch version by deploying the [latest Daemonset](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent) provided by AWS. Note that only deleting the hot patch Daemonset doesn't remove the hot patch service from your nodes. **Updated April 25**: Currently, there isn't a fixed Daemonset version for Debian-based hosts (Debian and Ubuntu). See this [GitHub thread](https://github.com/aws-samples/kubernetes-log4j-cve-2021-44228-node-agent/commit/cacdf35d40a3f1da84dac6aae9e807ac1b2c9d4f#commitcomment-72082620) for more details. **Updated May 5**: A fixed Daemonset version for Debian-based hosts was released. Note that the fixed version for the Debian log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch package is **1.1.17**.
2. On standalone hosts, you can upgrade by running yum update log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch.
3. Hotdog users need to upgrade to the [latest version](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/hotdog/releases).

Alternatively, if you're confident that your environment is patched against Log4Shell, you can disable the hot patch service on a host by running sudo touch /etc/log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch.kill. To disable Hotdog, run apiclient set oci-hooks.log4j-hotpatch-enabled=false.

Prisma Cloud customers can identify affected hosts under the Vulnerabilities tab. The platform detects the hot patch packages and alerts customers on VMs running a vulnerable version. To search for the vulnerabilities, use the Amazon Linux Security Advisories (ALAS) IDs associated with them: ALAS-2021-1554, ALAS-2021-1732, ALAS-2022-1580 and ALAS-2022-1773.

Palo Alto Networks [Prisma Cloud](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/cloud), [Cortex XDR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xdr) and [Next-Generation Firewalls](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/network-security/next-generation-firewall) (NGFWs) can detect follow-on attacker activities and disrupt command and control communications like the reverse shell used in the demo.

## **Safely Interacting With Containers**

CVE-2021-3100, CVE-2021-3101, CVE-2022-0070 and CVE-2022-0071 add to a long list of container escape vulnerabilities that arise from a host process directly interacting with a running container. Simple tasks like copying files or spawning a new containerized process can have surprising outcomes when the container is malicious.

If you're building software around containers, defer to an established container runtime like [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) for operations involving a container's processes or filesystem. Although they have also had their share of vulnerabilities, container runtimes are by far the most vetted and mature programs for safely interacting with containers.

## **Conclusion**

Given the urgency surrounding Log4Shell, users may have deployed hot patches at scale, inadvertently putting container environments at risk. We encourage users to upgrade to the fixed hot patch version as soon as possible. Multitenant container environments and clusters running untrusted images are especially at risk.

If you're still patching against Log4Shell, prioritize that effort first. While the presented issues can lead to severe attacks against container environments, Log4Shell has rightfully earned its spot as one of the worst vulnerabilities of all time and is still being actively exploited.

We'd like to thank AWS for their partnership and coordination in remediating this vulnerability efficiently. As Log4Shell exploitation peaked, AWS's hot patch helped the community stop countless attacks. With these vulnerabilities fixed, it's now possible to use the hot patch to address Log4Shell while also keeping container environments secure.

# Bottlerocket

Linux-based operating system purpose-built to run containers
[Get started with Bottlerocket](https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket#bottlerocket-os)

## Why Bottlerocket?

Bottlerocket is a Linux-based open-source operating system that is purpose-built by Amazon Web Services for running containers. Bottlerocket includes only the essential software required to run containers, and ensures that the underlying software is always secure. With Bottlerocket, customers can reduce maintenance overhead and automate their workflows by applying configuration settings consistently as nodes are upgraded or replaced.

Bottlerocket is now generally available at no cost as an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

Benefits

## Benefits

Open all

### Increased uptime for container applications

Updates to Bottlerocket are applied in a single step and can be rolled back if necessary, resulting in lower error rates and improved uptime for container applications. By contrast, general-purpose operating systems are typically updated package-by-package.

### Open-source development model enables custom builds

Bottlerocket’s open development model enables customers and partners to produce custom builds, for example, builds that support their preferred orchestrators. Changes in these custom builds can be contributed back for inclusion to the Bottlerocket open source project.

### Lower management overhead and operational costs

Updates to Bottlerocket can be automated using container orchestration services such as Amazon EKS, which lowers management overhead and reduces operational costs.

### Improved security and resource utilization

Bottlerocket includes only the essential software to run containers, which improves resource utilization and reduces the attack surface compared to general-purpose operating systems

### Optimized performance through AWS integrations

AWS provided builds of Bottlerocket are optimized to run on Amazon EC2 and include support for the latest Amazon EC2 instance capabilities. They also have built-in integrations with AWS services for container orchestration, registries, and observability.

### CIS hardening out of the box

Amazon Web Services’s Bottlerocket has been certified by the Center for Internet Security® (CIS®) to ship secure as hardened to CIS Bottlerocket Benchmark v1.0.0. Organizations that leverage Bottlerocket can now be assured that it will successfully run on a CIS hardened environment.

  ### Veeva Systems

  Veeva Systems is the leader in cloud-based software for the global life sciences industry. We run a variety of containerized microservices on a development cluster built entirely on Bottlerocket nodes. We adopted Bottlerocket because we wanted a streamlined container OS with better resource efficiency, enhanced security, and reduced management overhead. The transition to Bottlerocket was a seamless experience and it has largely been a drop-in replacement for our other EKS nodes.

  ### Sumo Logic

  Sumo Logic is an AWS-native SaaS analytics platform that helps companies ensure application reliability, secure and protect against modern threats, and gain insights into their cloud infrastructures. On a continuous mission to refine the efficiency, reliability, and security of its operations, Sumo Logic adopted Bottlerocket as the standard image for Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) nodes, resulting in a lower management overhead and improved compliance posture.

  ### GetYourGuide

  GetYourGuide is the booking platform for unforgettable travel experiences. Travelers use GetYourGuide to discover the best things to do at a destination — including walking tours by top local experts, local culinary tours, cooking and craft classes, skip-the-line tickets to the world’s most iconic attractions, bucket-list experiences and niche offerings you won’t usually find anywhere else. We chose Bottlerocket as the operating system for our Kubernetes clusters because it reduces node maintenance costs for us and improves our application security. Bottlerocket integrates seamlessly with EKS and the declarative approach to configure instances at startup ensures our node groups run with high reliability and consistency.

  ### Swisscom

  Swisscom is Switzerland's leading telecoms company and one of its leading IT companies. The vast majority of the workloads we run in the cloud are containerized and we have been promoting a Bottlerocket-first strategy for our Kubernetes clusters since the early stages of our AWS journey.

  Today, all our EKS worker nodes are powered by Bottlerocket OS. We adopted Bottlerocket because it is engineered to do one thing right: run containers. Run containers securely, thanks to a variety of built-in controls that create a secure environment for our applications. Run containers more efficiently by including only the essential runtime software and thus improving the overall instance resource utilization. Run containers for a very long time, being an opensource, community-backed project, capable to cope with future requirements effectively.

  ### PedidosYa

  PedidosYa, a brand of the German multinational company Delivery Hero, is a leading online delivery company in Latin America that connects millions of people with thousands of restaurants, markets, pharmacies and other partners in 15 countries. PedidosYa engineering platform is based on a microservices architecture running on containers. We use Bottlerocket as the base OS for all the nodes of our Kubernetes clusters which run hundreds of microservices on top of them.

  We decided to use Bottlerocket for several reasons**:**

  **Speed:** due to the size and characteristics of our business, it is crucial for us to scale fast enough to provide our customers with an excellent experience. Our experience with Bottlerocket has been that startup time is about 20 seconds, which is great compared to the previous OS which was over 1.5 minutes.
   **Security:** Bottlerocket is built to run containers, so it only has the needed software for this, and its attack surface is reduced to its minimum.
   **Maintenance:** updates are delivered safely through the API, and rollbacks are easy and fast.
   **Easy to use:** configuration and migration was straightforward for us. Migration from Docker runtime to containerd was really easy.

Cordial uses Bottlerocket OS for Kubernetes worker nodes across multiple EKS clusters, powering applications and ci-cd runners. We adopted Bottlerocket for the three main reasons:

  1. Bottlerocket has faster boot times and helps us scale our k8s clusters and applications faster

  2. Bottlerocket has a small attack surface

  3. The TOML config format used by Bottlerocket makes customization of kubelet settings very simple
