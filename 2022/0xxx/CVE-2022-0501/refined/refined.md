Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_GET['server']` parameter in the `lib/include.php` file. Specifically, the original code directly assigned the value of `$_GET['server']` to the `$GLOBALS['server']` variable:

```php
$GLOBALS['server'] = !empty($_GET['server']) ? $_GET['server'] : '';
```

This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary code or special characters into the `$GLOBALS['server']` variable through the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize or validate the user-supplied input from the `$_GET['server']` parameter before using it in the application.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:** While not explicitly stated in this diff, the lack of sanitization opens the door to potential XSS attacks if the `$GLOBALS['server']` variable is used to render content in the HTML without proper escaping.
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious code or commands via URL parameter.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the unsanitized `$GLOBALS['server']` is used to output content to the page without proper escaping, this can lead to XSS attacks. This could potentially allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect to malicious sites, or perform other actions within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Other Potential Impacts:** Depending on how the `$GLOBALS['server']` variable is used within the application, there could be other impacts, such as SQL injection or other types of injection attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that contains a malicious value for the `server` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application's server, which is typically done over the network.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker must know that the `server` parameter is vulnerable and how to exploit it.
- **No Special Privileges:** The attacker does not need to have any special privileges or access to the server.

**Mitigation:**
The commit `e351c82` addresses the vulnerability by adding `htmlspecialchars()` to sanitize the input received from the `$_GET['server']` parameter:

```php
$GLOBALS['server'] = !empty($_GET['server']) ? htmlspecialchars($_GET['server']) : '';
```
This function converts special characters to HTML entities which will prevent the malicious input from being interpreted as code by the browser and other layers of application stack.

This change prevents the direct insertion of HTML or script tags into the application and mitigates the XSS vulnerability.
