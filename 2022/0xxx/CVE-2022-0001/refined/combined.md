### Summary:

Potential security vulnerabilities in some Intel® Processors may allow information disclosure.Intel is releasing prescriptive guidance to address these potential vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2022-0001](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0001)

Description: Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor selectors between contexts in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 4.7 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

CVEID: [CVE-2022-0002](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0002)

Description: Non-transparent sharing of branch predictor within a context in some Intel(R) Processors may allow an authorized user to potentially enable information disclosure via local access.

CVSS Base Score: 4.7 Medium

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

### Affected Products:

Consult this list of affected products [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/topic-technology/software-security-guidance/processors-affected-consolidated-product-cpu-model.html).

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends that affected Intel® Processors disable access to managed runtimes in privileged modes to help prevent managed runtimes from being used as disclosure gadgets, such as unprivileged Extended Berkeley packet filter (eBPF) in kernel mode. Intel has worked with the Linux community to make this option available to all Linux users beginning in the Linux Kernel [5.16 stable version](https://www.kernel.org/). This option is already available in some Linux distributions. Systems administrators and end users should check with their Linux vendor to determine the status of the operating system version they are using.

Additional technical details can be found [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html)

### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Pietro Frigo, Enrico Barberis, Marius Muench, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida from the VUSec group at VU Amsterdam for reporting these issues.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 398 v2 - Multiple speculative security issues

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

                    Xen Security Advisory XSA-398
                              version 2

                  Multiple speculative security issues

UPDATES IN VERSION 2
====================

 * Provide more specific ARM URL
 * Provide additional link to the Intel technical whitepaper

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

Note: Multiple issues are contained in this XSA due to their interactions.

1) Researchers at VU Amsterdam have discovered Spectre-BHB, pertaining
   to the use of Branch History between privilege levels.

   ARM have assigned CVE-2022-23960.  Intel have assigned CVE-2022-0001
   (Branch History Injection) and CVE-2022-0002 (Intra-mode BTI).  AMD
   have no statement at the time of writing.

   For more details, see:
     <https://vusec.net/projects/bhi-spectre-bhb>
     <https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/speculative-processor-vulnerability/spectre-bhb>
     <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00598.html>
     <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/technical-documentation/branch-history-injection.html>

2) Researchers at Open Source Security, Inc. have discovered that AMD
   CPUs may speculate beyond direct branches.

   AMD have assigned CVE-2021-26341.

   For more details, see:
     <https://grsecurity.net/amd_branch_mispredictor_part_2_where_no_cpu_has_gone_before>
     <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1026>

3) Researchers at Intel have discovered that previous Spectre-v2
   recommendations of using lfence/jmp is incomplete.

   AMD have assigned CVE-2021-26401.

   For more details, see:
     <https://www.amd.com/en/corporate/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-1036>

IMPACT
======

An attacker might be able to infer the contents of arbitrary host
memory, including memory assigned to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Systems running all versions of Xen are affected.

Whether a CPU is potentially vulnerable depends on its
microarchitecture.  Consult your hardware vendor.

Xen does not have a managed runtime environment, so is not believed to
be vulnerable to CVE-2022-0002 irrespective of any hardware
susceptibility.

Xen does not have any known gadgets vulnerable to Direct Branch Straight
Line Speculation.  Therefore, no changes for CVE-2021-26341 are being
provided at this time.

The AMD BTI (Spectre v2) protections do not depend on isolating
predictions between different privileges, so the fact that Branch
History is shared (just like the Branch Target Buffer) is not believed
to be relevant to existing mitigations.  Therefore, there is no believed
impact from Spectre-BHB on AMD hardware.

Patches to mitigate CVE-2022-23960 on affected ARM CPUs are provided.

Intel have recommended not making any changes by default for
CVE-2022-0001.  Existing Spectre-v2 mitigations on pre-eIBRS hardware
are believed to be sufficient.  On eIBRS capable hardware, there is
uncertainty over the utility of Branch History Injection to an
adversary.  However, the risk can be removed by using eIBRS in
combination with retpoline.

For CVE-2021-26401, AMD have recommended using retpoline in preference
to lfence/jmp as previously recommended to mitigate Spectre-v2.  This
recommendation also mitigates any risk from Branch History Injection.

For both CVE-2022-0001 on Intel, and CVE-2021-26401 on AMD, the
suggestion to use retpoline is incompatible with CET Shadow Stacks as
implemented in Xen 4.14 and later.  The security team has decided that
disabling CET Shadow Stacks to work around speculation problems is not a
reasonable option for downstreams and end users.

Therefore, patches are also provided to:
 * Use IBRS on capable AMD hardware.  This also mitigates
   CVE-2021-26401.
 * Use CET Indirect Branch Tracking on capable Intel hardware.  CET-IBT
   has architectural guarantees about halting speculation, on top of
   being a hardware mechanism to protect against Call/Jump Oriented
   Programming attacks.

Both provide CET Shadow Stack compatible mitigations to these issues.  A
practical consequence of this decision is that CET Shadow Stacks are now
considered security supported, upgraded from Tech Preview previously.

Note: CET-IBT patches are incomplete and will be backported at a later date.

MITIGATION
==========

On AMD systems, CVE-2021-26401 can be mitigated by specifying:

 With CET-SS,    `spec-ctrl=bti-thunk=jmp,ibrs`
 Without CET-SS, `spec-ctrl=bti-thunk=retpoline`

on Xen's command line, and rebooting.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

Note that patches for released versions are generally prepared to
apply to the stable branches, and may not apply cleanly to the most
recent release tarball.  Downstreams are encouraged to update to the
tip of the stable branch before applying these patches.

## Linux kernel on Intel systems is susceptible to Spectre v2 attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#155143

Original Release Date: 2024-04-09 | Last Revised: 2024-12-19

---

### Overview

A new cross-privilege Spectre v2 vulnerability that impacts modern CPU architectures supporting speculative execution has been discovered. CPU hardware utilizing speculative execution that are vulnerable to Spectre v2 branch history injection (BHI) are likely affected. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to leak privileged memory from the CPU by speculatively jumping to a chosen gadget. Current research shows that existing mitigation techniques of disabling privileged eBPF and enabling (Fine)IBT are insufficient in stopping BHI exploitation against the kernel/hypervisor.

### Description

Speculative execution is an optimization technique in which a computer system performs some task preemptively to improve performance and provide additional concurrency as and when extra resources are available. However, these speculative executions leave traces of memory accesses or computations in the CPUâs cache, buffer, and branch predictors. Attackers can take advantage of these and, in some cases, also influence speculative execution paths via malicious software to infer privileged data that is part of a distinct execution. See article [Spectre Side Channels](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/hw-vuln/spectre.html) for more information. Attackers exploiting Spectre v2 take advantage of the speculative execution of indirect branch predictors, which are steered to gadget code by poisoning the branch target buffer of a CPU used for predicting indirect branch addresses, leaking arbitrary kernel memory and bypassing all currently deployed mitigations.

Current mitigations rely on the unavailability of exploitable gadgets to eliminate the attack surface. However, researchers demonstrated that with the use of their gadget analysis tool, InSpectre Gadget, they can uncover new, exploitable gadgets in the Linux kernel and that those are sufficient at bypassing deployed Intel mitigations.

### Impact

An attacker with access to CPU resources may be able to read arbitrary privileged data or system registry values by speculatively jumping to a chosen gadget.

### Solution

Please update your software according to the recommendations from respective vendors with the latest mitigations available to address this vulnerability and its variants.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Sander Wiebing, Alvise de Faveri Tron, Herbert Bos, and Cristiano Giuffrida from the VUSec group at VU Amsterdam for discovering and reporting this vulnerability, as well as supporting coordinated disclosure. This document was written by Dr. Elke Drennan, CISSP.

#### Vendor Statement

We'd like to thank the researchers for their work. It helps improve our understanding of these types of vulnerabilities. Our engineering teams conducted a thorough review and determined that Apple silicon based systems are not vulnerable to this type of attack. While Intel based Macs may be susceptible in theory, we are not aware of any proof-of-concept that demonstrates actual exploitability on the platform. We will continue to monitor research in this area, and will work to protect our customers if anything changes.
