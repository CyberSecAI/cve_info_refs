- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Like Button Rating plugin allows any logged-in user, including subscribers, to send arbitrary emails due to missing authorization checks in the `likebtn_test_vote_notification` action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authorization leading to arbitrary email sending. Specifically, the plugin does not properly validate the user's role before allowing them to send emails via the AJAX action.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker (any logged-in user) can send emails with arbitrary content to any recipient.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action=likebtn_test_vote_notification` parameter, along with email details in the `body` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the WordPress site, even a subscriber role is sufficient.
