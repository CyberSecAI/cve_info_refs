BUG/MAJOR: http/htx: prevent unbounded loop in http\_manage\_server\_sid…

…e_cookies

Ensure calls to http_find_header() terminate. If a "Set-Cookie2"
header is found then the while(1) loop in
http_manage_server_side_cookies() will never terminate, resulting in
the watchdog firing and the process terminating via SIGABRT.

The while(1) loop becomes unbounded because an unmatched call to
http_find_header("Set-Cookie") will leave ctx->blk=NULL. Subsequent
calls to check for "Set-Cookie2" will now enumerate from the beginning
of all the blocks and will once again match on subsequent
passes (assuming a match first time around), hence the loop becoming
unbounded.

This issue was introduced with HTX and this fix should be backported
to all versions supporting HTX.

Many thanks to Grant Spence (gspence@redhat.com) for working through
this issue with me.

The fix was backported in all affected versions. Last 2.5 and 2.4 releases include it. It is also true for last 2.3 and 2.2 releases. The next 2.0 will ship it too. It will be released this week.

[@tcherel](https://github.com/tcherel) that was done a month ago already (2.4.13 and 2.5.2). If you're running on up-to-date versions (2.4.14 or 2.5.4), you already have it.

[Willy Tarreau](/search?l=haproxy@formilux.org&q=from:%22Willy+Tarreau%22)
[Wed, 16 Feb 2022 07:28:06 -0800](/search?l=haproxy@formilux.org&q=date:20220216)

```
Hi,

HAProxy 2.5.2 was released on 2022/02/16. It added 44 new commits
after version 2.5.1.
```
```

This version addresses a few long-term bugs that have been keeping us
quite busy for far too long, but ultimately it's satisfying to know that
these ones are gone and that they won't be casting a doubt over every
single bug report.

The main issues fixed in this version are:
  - a tiny race condition in the scheduler affecting the rare multi-
    threaded tasks. In some cases, a task could be finishing to run
    on one thread and expiring on another one, just in the process
    of being requeued to the position being in the process of being
    calculated by the thread finishing with it. The most likely case
    was the peers task disabling the expiration while waiting for other
    peers to be locked, causing such a non-expirable task to be queued
    and to block all other timers from expiring (typically health checks,
    peers and resolvers, but others were affected). This could only
    happen at high peers traffic rate but it definitely did. When built
    with the suitable options such as DEBUG_STRICT it would immediately
    crash (which is how it was detected). This bug was present since 2.0.

  - a bug in the Set-Cookie2 response parser may result in an infinite
    loop triggering the watchdog if a server sends this while it belongs
    to a backend configured with cookie persistence. Usually cookie-based
    persistence is not used with untrusted servers, but if that was the
    case, the following rule would be usable as a workaround for the time
    it takes to upgrade:

         http-response del-header Set-Cookie2

    It reminded us that 2.5 years ago we were discussing about completely
    dropping Set-Cookie2 which never succeeded in field, Tim has opened an
    issue so that we don't forget to remove it after 2.6. This issue was
    diagnosed, reported and fixed by Andrew McDermott and Grant Spence.
    This bug was there since 1.9.

  - a bug in the SPOE error handling. When a connection to an agent dies,
    there may still be requests pending that are tied to this connection.
    The list of such requests is scanned so that they can be aborted,
    except that the condition to scan the list was incorrect, and when
    these requests were finally aborted upon processing timeout, they were
    updating the memory area they used to point to, which could have been
    reused for anything, causing random crashes very commonly seen in
    libc's malloc/free va openssl, or haproxy pools with corrupted pointers.
    In short, anyone using SPOE must absolutely update to apply the fix
    otherwise any bug they face cannot be trusted as we know there's a rare
    but real case of memory corruption there. This bug was present since
    1.8.

  - there was a possible race condition on the listeners where it was
    sometimes possible to wake up a temporarily paused listener just after
    it had failed to rebind upon a failed attempt to reload. This would
    access fdtab[-1] causing memory corruption or crashes. It's been there
    since 2.2 but really started to have an effect with 2.3.

  - the master CLI could remain stuck forever if extra characters followed
    by a shutdown were sent before the end of a response. In this case, each
    such connection would remain unusable, and a script doing this would
    face a connection failure after the 10th attempt (master's maxconn). A
    few related issues could also cause it to loop forever (e.g. too long
    pipelined requests, and empty buffers after wrapping).

  - the connection stopping list introduced in 2.4 to deal with idle
    frontend connection on reloads missed a deletion, and could leave link
    elements in the list after their containing structure was freed, causing
    occasional crashes of the old process upon reload.

  - there is an ambiguity in the definition of dynamic table size updates
    between the HTTP/2 spec (RFC7540) and the HPACK spec (RFC7541) which
    can be read two ways. HAProxy and a few servers interpret it one way
    and a few clients and other servers interpret it another way (and
    generally clients win, as usual). One client, nghttp, enforces it
    strictly, causing interoperability issues with haproxy and a few other
    ones when the table size is set below 4096. We had a long discussion
    with other participants of the HTTP working group to find the best
    path forward that resulted in a nice update of the H2 spec that
    preserves the best interoperability with existing components while
    clarifying all points. This update is present in this version and
    will be progressively backported to older ones after some time (I
    managed to mess up with the first attempt).

  - the HTTP client might not always start to send requests which were
    ready in advance (before the connection is requested), it used to work
    most of the time thanks to the scheduling of events but was a bit
    fragile and could easily crash if the sequencing of events changed a
    bit.

  - there was an issue with the data transfer in the HTX layer, however
    I'm not very clear on the impact, I think it can sometimes cause data
    to be truncated or just blocked.

  - it was possible to temporarily lose the stats sockets upon reloads in
    master-worker mode in case of early error (e.g. missing config file),
    in which case the socket transfer from the older process couldn't
    happen.

  - the "set server ssl" CLI command introduced in 2.4 had the undesirable
    side effect of modifying the data path and the check path at the same
    time (by mimmicking the configration), which causes quite some trouble.
    Now the doc was updated to clearly state that only the data path is
    updated, and the code does that (otherwise it is unusable anyway).

  - there were still a number of other issues of lower level of importance,
    such as the CLI being extremely slow to parse pipelined requests because
    it was looking for the line feed first, hence the larger the buffer, the
    slower it was with batch updates like ACL/map updates; there were a few
    issues in the JWT code on exit (double free in deinit etc), missing
    headers in the HTTP client, a possibly truncated pidfile in master mode.

Some debugging options were added and backported. One that recently helped
us is DEBUG_POOL_INTEGRITY combined with the existing DEBUG_DONT_SHARE_POOLS
and DEBUG_STRICT. The first two ones will provide sort of an equivalent of
the use-after-free debug option that was not suitable for production, by
checking if released memory areas were tampered with between their last
free() and the next malloc(). This slightly increases CPU usage (1-2%
typically) but will catch most memory corruptions much earlier and much
cleaner than what happened over the last weeks: instead of crashing at
random places that are victims of a change, the crash happens much closer
to the bad actor, and with more context to figure what happened.

And quite frankly for all those who can afford it (i.e. all those not running
at more than 98% CPU), I would kindly ask to add these 4 options to their
build command line so that their future bug reports are much more accurate:

  $ make ... DEBUG="-DDEBUG_STRICT -DDEBUG_MEMORY_POOLS \
                    -DDEBUG_DONT_SHARE_POOLS -DDEBUG_POOL_INTEGRITY"

This also allows developers to quickly rule out many potential causes and
provide responses faster. By the way we're always running with all debugging
turned full-throttle on haproxy.org and recently switched from DEBUG_UAF to
DEBUG_POOL_INTEGRITY.

Maybe that would even be a nice improvement for distros to provide these
by default starting with 2.6 or maybe even 2.5.

Older stable versions are following with essentially the same set of fixes.
2.4 is in the blocks already, and 2.3+2.2+2.0 probably next week.

I would like to address sincere and warm thanks to Christian Ruppert,
Yves Lafon and Pierre Cheynier for having provided lots of help and traces,
deployed and rebuilt almost daily with extra debug code over the last few
weeks to address the painful series of issues above. Their participation
was invaluable and their continued efforts finally pay for all of us.
Keep up the great job guys!

Package        : haproxy
CVE ID         : CVE-2022-0711

A flaw was discovered in the way HAProxy, a fast and reliable load
balancing reverse proxy, processes HTTP responses containing the
"Set-Cookie2" header, which can result in an unbounded loop, causing a
denial of service.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.9-2+deb11u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.

For the detailed security status of haproxy please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/haproxy>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
