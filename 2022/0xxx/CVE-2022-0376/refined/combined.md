## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# User Meta < 2.4.3 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape the Form Name, as well as Shared Field Labels before outputting them in the admin dashboard when editing a form, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when unfiltered\_html is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

An an admin
- Create/edit a form and put the following payload in the Form name field: "><script>alert(/XSS-form-name/)</script>
- Edit a Shared Field and put the following payload in the Field Label: "><script>alert(/XSS-field-label/)</script>
Then edit the form again to trigger the XSS via Form Name, click on the shared field to trigger XSS via Field Label
