- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the "Form Name" and "Shared Field Labels" before outputting them in the admin dashboard when editing a form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This can lead to various impacts, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** By inserting malicious JavaScript into the "Form Name" or "Shared Field Labels" fields while creating or editing a form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the WordPress site to create or edit forms.
