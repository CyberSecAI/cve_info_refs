Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Contact Form Submissions plugin was not properly sanitizing and escaping user-provided data, specifically within the "additional fields" of contact form requests, before displaying it in the submission view within the WordPress admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This means that malicious scripts injected through form submissions are saved in the database and executed when an administrator views the submission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed within the administrator's browser when viewing the submission, allowing for a wide range of attacks, such as:
    *   Stealing admin session cookies.
    *   Redirecting the admin to a malicious site.
    *   Modifying content or settings on the WordPress site.
    *   Potentially escalating privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Contact Form Submission:** The attacker submits a contact form with a crafted "additional field" that contains malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker submitting a form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to the WordPress site.
*   **Access to a Contact Form:** The attacker must have access to a contact form that uses the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious JavaScript code.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the plugin's `Submissions.php` file where the `add_post_meta` function saves the "additional fields" directly into the database, without sanitization.
*  The plugin's `Admin.php` file displays these fields without proper output escaping which leads to the XSS.

**Patch Details:**

*   The fix, implemented in version 1.7.3, involves:
    *   Removing `wp_kses_post()` from `Submissions.php` when saving the additional fields.
    *   Using `esc_attr()` and `esc_html()` to sanitize output in `Admin.php`.
    *   Using `wp_kses_post()` for displaying the labels for the fields.

**Additional Details from Content**

*   The WPVDB ID is `d02cf542-2d75-46bc-a0df-67bbe501cc89`
