- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress plugin "Visual Form Builder" does not implement proper nonce checks when deleting or restoring form entries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful CSRF attack can allow an attacker to make a logged-in administrator or editor delete or restore arbitrary form entries.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts malicious HTML forms or links that, when accessed by a logged-in administrator, trigger actions such as deleting or restoring form entries on the vulnerable website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator or editor to visit a malicious webpage or click a malicious link. The attacker does not need to have any prior privileges/access to the website.
