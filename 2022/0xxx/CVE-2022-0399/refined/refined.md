Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the `berocket_apl_color_listener` AJAX action of the "Advanced Product Labels for WooCommerce" plugin. The `tax_color_set_type` parameter is not properly sanitized before being included in the AJAX response.

**Weakness:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to lack of sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a user's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Website defacement
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious activities

**Attack Vector:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious link that includes the XSS payload in the `tax_color_set_type` parameter
- The victim (authenticated user) clicks on the link, or the attacker tricks the user to visit the page that contains this link.
- The malicious javascript executes in the victim's browser in the context of the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need specific privileges or to be logged in to trigger this vulnerability.
- An attacker needs the ability to persuade a logged-in user to click on the malicious link or visit a page that contains the malicious link.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.2.3.7 of the plugin.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject a simple javascript alert using the vulnerable parameter.
- The vulnerable code is located in the `includes/better_position.php` file.
- The fix involved sanitizing the user-provided input using functions like `sanitize_text_field()` and `esc_attr()` before outputting it in the response.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 6.1 (Medium).
