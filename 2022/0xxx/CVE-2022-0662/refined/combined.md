## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Adrotate < 5.8.23 - Admin+ XSS via Advert Name

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape Advert Names which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit an Advert and put the following payload in the Name field: "><img src=x onerror=alert(/XSS/)>
The XSS will be triggered when accessing the Manage Adverts page

### Affects Plugins
