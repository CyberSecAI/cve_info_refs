- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Adrotate plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape the Advert Names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the "Name" field of an advert. When a user accesses the "Manage Adverts" page, the script will be executed in their browser. This could lead to account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the "Name" field of an advert. An attacker with administrative privileges can create or edit an advert and inject the malicious script.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges or a high-privilege user to create/edit Adverts.
