Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-0958

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of user-supplied input when creating new markers within the "Mark Posts" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin didn't properly escape HTML tags within marker names, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. Malicious scripts can be injected into the plugin's settings and stored in the database, and executed when other users view the affected pages in the WordPress admin area.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to sanitize the input provided for new marker names, enabling attackers to insert arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.
- **Inadequate Output Escaping:** The plugin does not properly escape output in the admin interface, meaning that stored XSS payloads are rendered and executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they access the affected pages in the WordPress admin area.
- **Account Hijacking:**  Attackers could potentially hijack administrator or other high-privilege user accounts by using the XSS payload to steal cookies or redirect users to malicious sites.
- **Content Manipulation:** The attacker might be able to modify the site's content, inject malicious links, or perform other unwanted actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Panel:** The attack vector is through the admin panel of the WordPress site. An attacker needs to have admin-level or high privilege access to insert the malicious payload via the plugin's "Add new markers" settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin or High-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs to be an administrator or user with high privileges capable of managing the plugin's settings to add new markers.
- **Knowledge of the Plugin Settings:** The attacker must be aware of the plugin's settings page to inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.1 of the Mark Posts plugin.
- The provided proof-of-concept payload is: `"autofocus onfocus=alert(/XSS/) b="`.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS score is 3.4 (low).
