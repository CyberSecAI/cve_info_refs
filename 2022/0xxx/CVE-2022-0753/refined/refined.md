    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the usage of user-controlled input without proper sanitization in shell commands via `escapeshellarg`. The code was double escaping shell arguments, resulting in unexpected behavior. In addition, the user variable from session was not escaped, leading to potential command injection if a malicious user could control the session variable or other variables used in shell commands.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Improper Input Sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user if they can manipulate the input provided to the application via GET parameters, or if they can manipulate session variables.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "HTTP GET parameters",
          "Manipulation of session variables"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to either be able to manipulate HTTP GET parameters or find a way to control the session variables used in the code. In some cases, an authenticated user might be required."
