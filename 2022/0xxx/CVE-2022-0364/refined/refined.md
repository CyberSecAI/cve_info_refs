- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of the Hourly Schedule parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the hourly schedule parameters, which will be executed when other users view/preview the event.
- **Attack vectors:** By adding a malicious payload (e.g., `<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`) into the hourly schedule title or any of the hourly schedule row fields (from, to, title, description)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have Contributor level access or higher to create/edit Events.
