Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-0196:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Phoronix Test Suite was vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF protection: The application did not properly validate the origin of requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a legitimate user. The specific actions that could be performed aren't detailed here.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious website or email could trick a user's browser into making unauthorized requests to the Phoronix Test Suite application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious site or opening a malicious email.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, only the targeted user does.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was present in the `phoromatic` component, which is related to the web interface for managing the test suite.
- Patches were implemented to address the CSRF vulnerability through the introduction of a token based mechanism.
- The fix involved adding `verify_submission_token()` checks before executing certain actions, and tokens to relevant forms.
- The fix also included a function to add token to urls: `append_token_to_url()`
- The `pts_strings::sanitize` function was applied to some user controlled inputs to further prevent injection attacks.
- Specific files that were modified to fix the issue include:
  - `pts-core/objects/pts_strings.php`
  - `pts-core/phoromatic/pages/phoromatic_local_suites.php`
  - `pts-core/phoromatic/pages/phoromatic_schedules.php`
