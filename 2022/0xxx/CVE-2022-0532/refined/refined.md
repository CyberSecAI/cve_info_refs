{
  "CVE-2022-0532": {
    "description": "An incorrect sysctls validation vulnerability was found in CRI-O. The sysctls from the list of \"safe\" sysctls specified for the cluster will be applied to the host if an attacker can create a pod with a `hostIPC` and `hostNetwork` kernel namespace.",
    "root_cause": "CRI-O incorrectly validates sysctls when a pod uses `hostIPC` and `hostNetwork` namespaces, allowing safe sysctls to be applied to the host rather than the pod.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect sysctl validation",
      "Lack of proper namespace isolation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify host-level sysctl parameters. This can potentially lead to node instability or a breakout from the container.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting a pod with `hostIPC` and `hostNetwork` namespaces"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create pods with the `hostIPC` and `hostNetwork` options enabled, and specify a safe sysctl from the list of allowed sysctls for the cluster"
  }
