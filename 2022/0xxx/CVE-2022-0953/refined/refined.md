- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `QUERY_STRING` before outputting it on an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the victim's browser when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious website, or performing actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `QUERY_STRING` parameter. Specifically, the `page` parameter within the `/wp-admin/admin.php` endpoint is vulnerable
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a crafted URL. The vulnerability can be exploited via the browser.
