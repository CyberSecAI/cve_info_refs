The provided content relates to CVE-2022-0234.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `woocs_in_order_currency` parameter within the `woocs_get_products_price_html` AJAX action. The plugin outputs this unsanitized parameter back in the response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that would be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities like:
  - Stealing cookies
  - Session hijacking
  - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is triggered via a crafted URL sent to the victim. The vulnerable parameter is part of the AJAX action `woocs_get_products_price_html`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the `woocs_in_order_currency` parameter.
- The attacker does not require authentication, as the action is available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.7.5 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is present in the `classes/woocs.php` file.
- The vulnerable code was located on lines 3156, 4002, and 4031.
- The fix involves using `sanitize_text_field` on the `woocs_in_order_currency` parameter and `array_map('intval',...)` for `products_ids` parameters.
