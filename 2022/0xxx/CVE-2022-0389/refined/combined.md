## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP Time Slots Booking Form < 1.1.63 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape Calendar names, allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Create a new calendar with the following Name: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
The XSS will be triggered when editing or publishing the calendar
