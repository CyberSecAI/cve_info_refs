- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logical error in parsing HTTP/2 HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frames containing padding without other data. This leads to incorrect size calculation, causing a parsing error and immediate process crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of HTTP/2 padding within HEADERS and PUSH_PROMISE frames, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability. Specifically, the parsing logic fails when a padded frame lacks any other data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A denial of service (DoS) attack where the server immediately crashes upon receiving a crafted frame, causing a service disruption and loss of in-flight connections. Repeated sending of these crafted frames can easily maintain the DoS.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted HTTP/2 HEADERS or PUSH_PROMISE frame with padding but without any other data. Any peer with a connection to the vulnerable service (client or server) can send this frame.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to establish an HTTP/2 connection with the vulnerable service to send a malicious frame. No special permissions or user interaction are needed for the exploit. The attacker requires very few resources to carry out the attack and sustain the denial-of-service state.
