- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the Description field when editing a gallery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the Description field of a gallery. This script can then be executed in the browsers of other users who access the gallery dashboard (e.g. an admin checking the gallery) which could lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** By creating or editing a gallery and adding a malicious payload in the Description field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker with Contributor role or higher can perform this attack.
