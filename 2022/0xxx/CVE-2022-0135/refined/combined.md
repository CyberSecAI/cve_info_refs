| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2037790#c0)  Michael Kaplan    2022-01-06 15:24:29 UTC  ``` An out-of-bound write was found in virglrenderer in src/vrend_renderer.c:read_transfer_data().   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=2037790#c1)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-01-31 15:06:50 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer/-/commit/95e581fd181b213c2ed7cdc63f2abc03eaaa77ec>  MR: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer/-/merge_requests/654/commits>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=2037790#c2)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-01-31 15:35:22 UTC  ``` Created virglrenderer tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-8 [[bug 2048607](show_bug.cgi?id=2048607 "NEW - CVE-2022-0135 virglrenderer: out-of-bounds write in read_transfer_data() [epel-8]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 2048606](show_bug.cgi?id=2048606 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2022-0135 virglrenderer: out-of-bounds write in read_transfer_data() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=2037790#c5)  Mauro Matteo Cascella    2022-01-31 17:35:34 UTC  ``` The flaw arises from the fact that both vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov() and read_transfer_data() calculate `send_size` to allocate a buffer and transfer data to it, respectively. However, they calculate the size in a slightly different way: vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov() does not take `box->depth` into account. Under certain circumstances, this could lead to the allocation of a smaller heap buffer which is later accessed out-of-bounds by read_transfer_data.   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 946942 949954 1009073

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in virglrenderer, a virtual
GPU for KVM virtualization.

CVE-2019-18388

    A NULL pointer dereference in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through
    0.8.0 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service via malformed
    commands.

CVE-2019-18389

    A heap-based buffer overflow in the vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov
    function in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows
    guest OS users to cause a denial of service, or QEMU guest-to-host
    escape and code execution, via VIRGL_CCMD_RESOURCE_INLINE_WRITE
    commands.

CVE-2019-18390

    An out-of-bounds read in the vrend_blit_need_swizzle function in
    vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows guest OS
    users to cause a denial of service via VIRGL_CCMD_BLIT commands.

CVE-2019-18391

    A heap-based buffer overflow in the vrend_renderer_transfer_write_iov
    function in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through 0.8.0 allows
    guest OS users to cause a denial of service via
    VIRGL_CCMD_RESOURCE_INLINE_WRITE commands.

CVE-2020-8002

    A NULL pointer dereference in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through
    0.8.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service via commands that attempt
    to launch a grid without previously providing a Compute Shader (CS).

CVE-2020-8003

    A double-free vulnerability in vrend_renderer.c in virglrenderer through
    0.8.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service by triggering texture
    allocation failure, because vrend_renderer_resource_allocated_texture is not an
    appropriate place for a free.

CVE-2022-0135

    An out-of-bounds write issue was found in the VirGL virtual OpenGL renderer
    (virglrenderer). This flaw allows a malicious guest to create a specially
    crafted virgil resource and then issue a VIRTGPU_EXECBUFFER ioctl, leading to a
    denial of service or possible code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.7.0-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your virglrenderer packages.
