- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape some of its settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A high-privilege user, such as an admin, can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of other users when they view the affected pages. This can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious payload within the plugin's settings text fields, such as "Add to Mylist icon".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges, such as administrative access, to modify the plugin's settings.
