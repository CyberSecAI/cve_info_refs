Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2022-0812:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to an information leak flaw in the Linux Kernel's NFS over RDMA implementation. Specifically, the flaw lies in `net/sunrpc/xprtrdma/rpc_rdma.c` where the header size calculation for RPC messages is incorrect.
- An incorrect assignment operator (`=`) is used instead of an addition assignment operator (`+=`) when calculating the header size of a message payload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- The incorrect header size calculation in the NFS over RDMA implementation leads to a potential information leak.
- Specifically, when a file read from NFS over RDMA is less than 700 bytes, it may contain random parts of memory from other files in the NFS filesystem or from the kernel's `.data` section.
- The vulnerability affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.8.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker with normal user privileges can exploit this flaw to leak kernel information. This could expose sensitive data stored in kernel memory.
- The leaked information may include data from other files in the NFS filesystem or from kernel memory regions.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based, specifically through the NFS over RDMA protocol.
- A local attacker, with normal user privileges, can trigger the vulnerability by reading small files over NFS using RDMA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker needs to have normal user privileges on a system using a vulnerable version of the Linux kernel.
- The attacker also requires network access to a system that utilizes NFS over RDMA.

**Additional Technical Details:**

-   The vulnerability was introduced in the Linux kernel by commit `302d3deb2068` ("xprtrdma: Prevent inline overflow") in v4.7 and fixed in v5.8 by commit `912288442cb2` ("xprtrdma: fix incorrect header size calculations").
-   The core issue is within the `rpcrdma_max_call_header_size` and `rpcrdma_max_reply_header_size` functions, where the header size was not correctly accumulated.
-   SUSE has addressed this issue in their products, but will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel. They may declare some bug classes as won't fix. Refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details.

**Other Information:**

-   NetApp considers this a moderate severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 4.3. However, SUSE gives it a higher score of 6.5 due to the confidentiality impact.
-   Several vendors (SUSE, NetApp, Ubuntu) have released patches or acknowledged this vulnerability, with varying levels of severity assigned.
-   The vulnerability is not exploitable against RHEL 7.2 or earlier NFS servers as server-side NFS over RDMA was a Tech Preview and unsupported
-   There are numerous specific package versions listed as fixes in various advisories from SUSE for multiple products and versions of their operating system.
-   Several cloud image revisions with fixes are available.

The vulnerability specifically affects the following NetApp products:

- Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere
- NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S
- NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C
