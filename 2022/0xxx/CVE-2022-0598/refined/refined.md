- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape plugin settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** High privilege users (Admin+) can perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the context of the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts into plugin settings fields (e.g., button border radius, title of login form).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be an admin or higher privileged user to access and modify the plugin settings.
