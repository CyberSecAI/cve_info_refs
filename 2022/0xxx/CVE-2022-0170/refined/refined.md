Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control when listing video comments and threads in PeerTube. Specifically, the application fails to properly enforce privacy settings when retrieving comments associated with private or internal videos.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Authorization Checks:** The code lacks proper authorization checks to prevent unauthorized users from listing comments and threads associated with private or internal videos. It does not consistently verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the video's comments.
- **Missing Privacy Enforcement:** The vulnerability arises due to the failure to enforce video privacy settings when accessing comment data. This allows users who should not have access to view comments associated with private videos.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access and view comments and threads associated with private or internal videos without proper authorization. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, user discussions, or other data meant to be kept private.
- **Privacy Violation:** The privacy of users who have posted comments on private videos is compromised as an unauthorized user can view these comments.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct API Requests:** An attacker can directly make API requests to the `/api/v1/videos/<video_id>/comment-threads` endpoint (and similar endpoints for thread comments) to retrieve comments of private videos, even when lacking authorization to access the video itself.
- **Bypassing Frontend Controls:** Even if the user interface restricts access, an attacker could still exploit this vulnerability by making direct API calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the PeerTube instance.
- **API Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the API endpoints related to video comments.
- **No Account Needed Initially:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve comments on private videos even without having a valid user account initially. However, the fix requires a valid token to see comments of a private video.

**More Details than the CVE Description:**

The provided content gives more details than the typical CVE description by highlighting the specific code changes involved in fixing the issue. It shows how the authorization checks were added in `server/middlewares/validators/videos/video-comments.ts`, and how the corresponding tests were added in `server/tests/api/check-params/video-comments.ts` to prevent unauthorized access to comments. This detailed view allows for a better understanding of how the vulnerability was exploited and how it was fixed.
