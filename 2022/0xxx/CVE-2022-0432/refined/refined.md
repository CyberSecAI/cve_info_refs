Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the commit:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a prototype pollution bug in the `embed.js` file. It arises from how the application handles messages received via `window.addEventListener('message')`. Specifically, it appears that the application was not properly validating the `id` property of the incoming message, allowing an attacker to potentially overwrite properties on the `Object.prototype` via the `__proto__` property.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Prototype pollution: The primary vulnerability is that the code was vulnerable to prototype pollution by improperly handling the 'id' property of incoming messages.
- Lack of origin validation: The code did not properly validate the `e.origin` of incoming messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: By polluting the prototype, the attacker could potentially inject malicious javascript that could be executed in the context of any other script that used the prototype. This could potentially allow for information theft, privilege escalation, or cross-site scripting attacks.
- Denial of Service: While not explicitly stated, prototype pollution can also result in denial of service by corrupting data structures and crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cross-document messaging: The vulnerability is triggered through cross-document messaging (using `window.postMessage` to send data to the iframe).
- Malicious iframe or cross-domain page: An attacker could host a malicious page containing a frame targeting the vulnerable application. This malicious frame would send specially crafted messages to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host a page that can communicate with the vulnerable application's iframe using `postMessage`.
- The attacker does not need access to the server, as the exploitation is performed client-side.

**Additional Details**
- The commit fixes the vulnerability by adding a check for `window.location.origin !== e.origin` to ensure that only messages from the same origin are processed. It also checks if `data.id.toString() === '__proto__'` to prevent manipulation of the prototype.
