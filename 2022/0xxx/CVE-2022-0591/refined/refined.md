- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate the URL parameter in the `formcraft3_get` AJAX action.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability due to lack of URL validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially accessing internal resources or performing actions on other services.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint with the `action` parameter set to `formcraft3_get` and the `URL` parameter set to an attacker-controlled URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
