- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not sanitize and escape the `match` parameter before outputting it in an admin page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is carried out via a crafted URL with a malicious payload in the `match` parameter. The user must visit the crafted URL for the exploit to work.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious URL. The victim must be an authenticated user, as the vulnerability occurs in the admin page. The attacker needs no prior access to the system.
