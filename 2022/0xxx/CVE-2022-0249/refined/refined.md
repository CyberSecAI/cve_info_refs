Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0249:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insufficient blocking of shared address space by `/lib/gitlab/url_blocker.rb`. Specifically, the `100.64.0.0/10` netmask was not blocked, allowing access to internal services via crafted URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF, enabling an attacker to make requests to internal resources or other external services from the GitLab server. This was possible by utilizing the shared address space `100.64.0.0/10`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Access:** An attacker could potentially access internal services or other resources within the GitLab server's network that are not intended to be exposed to external users.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker may be able to gather sensitive information by interacting with internal services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Git Repository URL:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the "Repo by URL" functionality when creating a new project. An attacker provides a malicious URL in the "Git repository URL" field that points to a resource within the shared address space.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a new project or have access to a function using `/lib/gitlab/url_blocker.rb` to input a Git repository URL. 
- They also need to be aware of the internal network infrastructure to target relevant internal IPs
- No special permissions are required beyond the ability to create a project.
