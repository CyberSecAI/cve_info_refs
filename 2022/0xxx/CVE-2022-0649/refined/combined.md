## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Adrotate < 5.8.23 - Admin+ XSS via Group Name

### Description

The plugin does not escape Group Names, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html capability is disallowed

### Proof of Concept

Create/edit a group and put the following payload in the Name field: " style=animation-name:rotation onanimationstart=alert(/XSS/)//
The XSS will be triggered when editing the group again
