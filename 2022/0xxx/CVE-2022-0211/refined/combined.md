## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Shield Security < 13.0.6 - Admin+ Stored Cross-Site Scripting

### Description

The plugin does not sanitise and escape admin notes, which could allow high privilege users to perform Cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered\_html is disallowed.

### Proof of Concept

Put the following payload as an Admin Note (Shield Security > Tools > Admin Notes): <script>alert(/XSS/);</script>

### Affects Plugins
