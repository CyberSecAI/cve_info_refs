- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and escape admin notes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of other users who view the admin notes. This can lead to a range of malicious activities, including session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other administrative actions, depending on the privileges of the user whose browser is compromised.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts into the "Admin Notes" field within the plugin settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges to access and modify the "Admin Notes" section of the plugin.
