- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize or escape some of its settings, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability. Specifically, the "本地文件夹" or "URL前缀" settings are vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (e.g., admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected plugin settings page. This allows for arbitrary actions on the vulnerable website within the scope of the user, who triggers the code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the WordPress site to access and modify the plugin settings. They would then insert malicious code into the vulnerable plugin setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must be logged in as an administrator or other high-privilege user.
