- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kunze Law WordPress plugin fails to properly escape user-provided input in the 'E-Mail Error "From" Address' setting. This allows the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper output sanitization of the 'E-Mail Error "From" Address' setting.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'E-Mail Error "From" Address' setting. When a user views the page where this setting is displayed, the malicious code will be executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the WordPress site to access and modify the plugin settings.
