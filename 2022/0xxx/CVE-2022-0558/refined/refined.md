The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0558, which is described as an XSS vulnerability in the tagging module of Microweber.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data within the `tagging_tag_edit` function before saving into the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to unsanitized user input. Specifically, the `tagging_tag_edit` function in `userfiles/modules/tags/TaggingTagsManager.php` was vulnerable because the input data was not properly sanitized before being stored in the database.
- The commit addresses this by introducing a new `HTMLClean` class that uses `voku/anti-xss` library to clean the input data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the tagging functionality. This could result in various malicious activities, including:
- Stealing user session cookies,
- Performing actions on behalf of the logged in user,
- Redirecting the user to malicious websites,
- Defacing the web application,
- And other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `tagging_tag_edit` function, likely via a form or an API endpoint that allows users to edit tags.
- The attacker would need to provide malicious javascript code within the fields when creating or editing a tag.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create or edit tags.
