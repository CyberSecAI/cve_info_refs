Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in Quarkus where state and potentially associated permissions can leak from one web request to another in RestEasy Reactive. This happens because the Hibernate Reactive Session/EntityManager is not properly managed, leading to the use of a closed session across different requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Scope Leakage:**  The primary vulnerability is the leakage of state and permissions between web requests due to improper session management in RestEasy Reactive.
- **Improper Session Handling:** The Hibernate Reactive Session/EntityManager is closed prematurely or is not correctly scoped to a single request. This leads to the use of closed session in subsequent requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can perform operations on the database with a different set of privileges than intended.
- **Data Corruption/Unauthorized Access:** By using a session with elevated privileges, an attacker could potentially access, modify, or delete data that they are not authorized to manage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Concurrent Web Requests:** The vulnerability is triggered during concurrent requests to the application.
- **Resteasy Reactive Request Filter:** The presence of a RestEasy Reactive request filter exacerbates the issue.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User:**  An attacker needs to be a user of the affected application, though they do not need to have elevated privileges.
- **Ability to make requests:** The attacker has to be able to make web requests to the application to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Concurrency:** The attacker needs to be able to generate concurrent requests to the affected endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in Quarkus version 2.7.1.Final.
- The issue is related to improper management of the Hibernate Reactive Session/EntityManager within the context of RestEasy Reactive request handling.
- The vulnerability is a regression compared to version 2.3.1.Final, which did not exhibit this behavior.
- The issue is related to how Hibernate Reactive handles the session in context of RestEasy Reactive.
