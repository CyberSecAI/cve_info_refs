The provided content relates to a commit in the LiveHelperChat repository where the developer added the `ng-non-bindable` attribute to several HTML elements in template files. This change is likely intended to prevent AngularJS from processing these elements, which could be related to a security issue where user-controlled data in these elements could be interpreted as Angular expressions, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause appears to be potential XSS vulnerabilities arising from AngularJS processing user-controlled data within specific template files (specifically `embedcode.tpl.php` and `htmlcode.tpl.php` for both `lhfaq` and `lhquestionary`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Unintended Angular processing:** Without `ng-non-bindable`, AngularJS might interpret user-provided strings as expressions to be evaluated, leading to code injection.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious code could be injected within the templates and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- XSS vulnerabilities can have a wide range of impacts, including:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Phishing attacks
  - Stealing sensitive user information

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious actor could attempt to inject Angular expressions into fields that are rendered in the affected templates, which would then be executed by the user's browser when viewing the page, potentially triggering malicious scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have the ability to inject malicious content into the system which is then rendered via the affected templates, this could be via multiple different routes including compromised administrator accounts or other vulnerabilities in the application.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the user, as the malicious payload is embedded within the webpage

**Changes Made:**
- The commit introduces the `ng-non-bindable` attribute to several `<div>` and `<select>` elements within the template files. This attribute prevents Angular from processing the contents of these elements. This change is found in the following files:
    - `lhc_web/design/defaulttheme/tpl/lhfaq/embedcode.tpl.php`
    - `lhc_web/design/defaulttheme/tpl/lhfaq/htmlcode.tpl.php`
    - `lhc_web/design/defaulttheme/tpl/lhquestionary/embedcode.tpl.php`

This commit aims to resolve an XSS vulnerability by preventing Angular from processing data in vulnerable contexts within the templates. This change is more detailed than the CVE description which is a placeholder.
