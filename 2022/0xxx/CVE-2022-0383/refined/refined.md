**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `pid` parameter when copying a Twitter source.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability
- Improper input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful SQL injection attack could lead to the attacker gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the `tid` and `taction` parameters, specifically by manipulating the `pid` parameter in the URL when copying a Twitter source.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
