**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can store a persistent JavaScript payload that will execute arbitrary actions in the Cortex XSOAR web interface on behalf of authenticated administrators when they interact with the payload. This could lead to:
    - Confidentiality Impact: HIGH
    - Integrity Impact: HIGH
    - Availability Impact: HIGH

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated.
- The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) to inject the malicious payload
- User interaction (UI:R) by an administrator is required for the exploit to trigger
