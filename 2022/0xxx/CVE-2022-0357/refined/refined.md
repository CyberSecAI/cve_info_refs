- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unquoted search path vulnerability in the Vulnerability Scan component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software uses an unquoted search path or element when executing a program which can be exploited to gain elevated privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can elevate privileges to SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Local, the attacker needs to place a malicious executable in a folder located in the unquoted path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access with high privileges to write files to locations searched by the application.
