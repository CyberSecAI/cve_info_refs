Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Booking Package plugin returns an `icalToken` in the JSON response to unauthenticated users when they perform a booking action. This token is intended for exporting the booking calendar in iCal format.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The `icalToken`, which grants access to booking data, is exposed in the JSON response to unauthenticated users.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):**  The `icalToken` acts as a direct reference to sensitive booking data, and its exposure allows anyone with the token to access the data.
*   **Missing Access Control:** There is a lack of proper access control mechanisms that prevents unauthenticated users from accessing the `icalToken` and, consequently, the booking data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the exposed `icalToken` to download all booking data, including customer names and email addresses, leading to a significant privacy breach.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:**  Confidential customer information is leaked, potentially exposing customers to further risks (e.g. phishing, identity theft).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by making a booking request with the `action: package_app_public_action` and `mode: sendbooking` parameters to the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Token Extraction:** The attacker can then extract the `icalToken` from the JSON response of the booking action.
*   **Data Retrieval:** Finally, the attacker can use the `icalToken` to access the booking information via the iCal export URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No authentication:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site hosting the vulnerable plugin.
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP requests:** The attacker must be able to make a `POST` request with the required parameters and analyze the JSON response.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of the Booking Package plugin prior to 1.5.29.
*   The iCal integration feature needs to be enabled in the plugin for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
