## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Booking Package < 1.5.29 - Unauthenticated Sensitive Data Disclosure

### Description

The plugin requires a token for exporting the ical representation of it's booking calendar, but this token is returned in the json response to unauthenticated users performing a booking, leading to a sensitive data disclosure vulnerability.

### Proof of Concept

When a guest make a booking via sending "action: package\_app\_public\_action" and "mode: sendbooking" request (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/ql7bqnl.png), there is a field "icalToken" in the response, screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/6hlNcgU.png
If the plugin has ical integration enabled, a threat actor can abuse this feature to download all the booking data, including email and name of all customers.
For example, this file is from demo site and has all the booking information: https://booking-package.saasproject.net/demo-booking/?id=1&ical=445976b9e3f3276019b4763fb138ad9895e0a641
