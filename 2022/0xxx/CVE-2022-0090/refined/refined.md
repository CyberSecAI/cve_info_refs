The provided content describes a vulnerability related to Git replacement references in GitLab.

**Root Cause:**
GitLab's Gitaly service does not properly handle Git replacement references when fetching blob object content. It uses `git filter-branch` and `git cat-file` without instructing Git to ignore replacement references.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Gitaly does not use the `GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS` environment variable or the `--no-replace-objects` option when executing Git commands to fetch blob content.
- GitLab does not warn users when replacement objects are used instead of the actual Git objects.
- GitLab allows pushing of replacement references, unlike GitHub.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Content Spoofing:** Users viewing files in the GitLab UI may see different content than what is actually in the repository.
- **Potential RCE:** Malicious code can be hidden using replacement references, leading to potential remote code execution if users or CI/CD systems use source code archives.
- **Trust Exploitation:** Users might trust the displayed content on GitLab, which is not consistent with the actual repository content.
- **Mismatch between displayed content on Gitlab and actual repository content:** When a user checks out the repo, he will get the malicious file, but the content of the file that GitLab renders through the UI will be different.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user with Developer access to a GitLab repository can push replacement references.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have at least Developer access to a GitLab repository.
- The attacker has to be able to push to the repository
- The attacker needs to create a malicious file and a replacement reference to mask the malicious file.

The content provides a proof-of-concept demonstrating how a developer can push replacement references, causing GitLab to display the wrong content for a file. It also highlights that this issue affects both GitLab.com and self-hosted instances and that installations using `rugged` are unlikely to be affected.
