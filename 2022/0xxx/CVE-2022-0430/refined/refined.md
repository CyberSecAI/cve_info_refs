The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0430.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `Domain` attribute of cookies when they were saved into session files. Specifically, all cookies were shared across all hosts during runtime, including redirects to third-party hosts. This behavior did not comply with RFC 6265.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of cookies to third-party hosts during redirects.
- Incorrect handling of the `Domain` attribute of cookies in session files, causing cookies intended for specific domains to be sent to others.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cookies meant for a specific domain could be exposed to third-party hosts during redirects. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- Redirects to third-party hosts while using HTTPie with saved sessions.
- An attacker could potentially gain access to cookies from a different domain than they are authorized for by using redirects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to initiate a request that causes a redirect to a third-party host while using a session file that has cookies stored.
- No specific position needed, only a normal usage of the HTTPie tool with sessions.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.1.0 of HTTPie.
- `httpie cli sessions upgrade` and `httpie cli sessions upgrade-all` commands were introduced to facilitate a smooth transition to the new session layout.
