Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's failure to properly sanitize uploaded SVG files, allowing for the execution of malicious scripts embedded within them. Specifically, the `dnd_codedropz_upload` AJAX action does not adequately validate or sanitize SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin allows the upload of SVG files, which can contain embedded JavaScript code.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The plugin does not sanitize the uploaded SVG content, enabling the execution of malicious scripts within the SVG file.
- **Stored XSS:** Due to the lack of sanitization, a malicious SVG file can be uploaded and stored on the server, leading to a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the website through the uploaded SVG file.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Upon a user accessing or viewing the malicious SVG file (e.g., through a direct link or if the file is embedded in the site), the embedded JavaScript code can be executed in the user's browser.
- **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive data, redirect users to malicious websites, or modify the content of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload via AJAX:** An attacker can upload a malicious SVG file using the `dnd_codedropz_upload` AJAX action.
- **Direct Access to Uploaded File:** The attacker can then access the uploaded SVG file directly (e.g., via its URL in the `/wp-content/uploads/wp_dndcf7_uploads/wpcf7-files/` directory).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of AJAX Action:** The attacker needs to know the `dnd_codedropz_upload` AJAX action and the required parameters for the file upload.
- **Ability to craft a malicious SVG file:** The attacker must be able to create an SVG file with embedded malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.3.6.3 of the plugin.
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to exploit the vulnerability by uploading a malicious SVG file with an `onload` event that triggers an alert box.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability caused by the lack of sanitization of SVG files uploaded through an AJAX action. An unauthenticated attacker can upload a malicious SVG file which then can be used to trigger arbitrary Javascript code in the browsers of site visitors.
