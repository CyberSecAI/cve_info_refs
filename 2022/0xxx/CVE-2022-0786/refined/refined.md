- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The KiviCare plugin does not properly sanitize and escape parameters before using them in SQL statements. This occurs via the `ajax_post` AJAX action with the `get_doctor_details` route.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database compromise.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted requests to the WordPress AJAX endpoint (`/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`). The vulnerable parameters are within the `clinic_id` and `props_doctor_id` parameters, which are used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users, requiring no prior access or privileges to the WordPress site.
