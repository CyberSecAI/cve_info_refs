## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# MapPress Maps for WordPress < 2.73.13 - Admin+ File Upload to Remote Code Execution

### Description

The plugin allows a high privileged user to bypass the DISALLOW\_FILE\_EDIT and DISALLOW\_FILE\_MODS settings and upload arbitrary files to the site through the "ajax\_save" function. The file is written relative to the current theme's stylesheet directory, and a .php file extension is added. No validation is performed on the content of the file, triggering an RCE vulnerability by uploading a web shell. Further the name parameter is not sanitized, allowing the payload to be uploaded to any directory to which the server has write access.

### Proof of Concept
