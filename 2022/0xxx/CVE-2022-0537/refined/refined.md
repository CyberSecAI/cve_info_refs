Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `ajax_save` function in the MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin. This function allows high-privileged users (Admin+) to upload arbitrary files to the server, bypassing the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` and `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure File Upload:** The plugin does not properly validate the file content before writing it to the server.
- **Bypassed Restrictions:** The plugin disregards the `DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT` and `DISALLOW_FILE_MODS` settings, which are intended to prevent file modification through the WordPress interface.
- **Lack of Sanitization:** The `name` parameter, used to determine the filename, is not sanitized. This allows attackers to potentially upload files to any directory on the server where the web server has write access.
- **Predictable File Path:** Uploaded files are saved relative to the current theme's stylesheet directory.
- **Automatic PHP Extension:** The plugin automatically appends a `.php` extension to uploaded files, facilitating execution of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code (a web shell), an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the website and server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a POST request to the `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` endpoint.
- **`mapp_tpl_save` Action:** The request must include the `action=mapp_tpl_save` parameter to trigger the vulnerable function.
- **`name` and `content` Parameters:** The malicious PHP file is provided as the `content` parameter and the file name using the `name` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Admin+ Privileges:** The attacker must have administrator-level or higher privileges on the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability. This is because the vulnerable function is only accessible to high-privileged users.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.73.13 of the MapPress Maps for WordPress plugin.
- The proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the upload of a simple web shell using a `name` parameter value of `zero.cgi` and the PHP code: `<?php+echo(`ls`);?>`.
- The attacker can upload the file to a location to which the web server has write access due to the lack of sanitization of the `name` parameter.
