The provided content is related to CVE-2022-0004.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from hardware debug modes and processor INIT settings that allow overriding locks in Intel Boot Guard and Intel TXT.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the ability to override locks related to Intel Boot Guard and Intel TXT via hardware debug modes and processor INIT settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privilege, potentially allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access and control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited through physical access to the system. Additionally, an adjacent network attack is possible given specific conditions (authenticated user).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- For physical access exploitation, the attacker needs physical access to the affected system.
- For adjacent network attack, the attacker needs to be on the adjacent network and have high privileges/authentication.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Intel processors and chipsets, including 8th to 12th Gen Core processors, Atom processors, Celeron, Pentium processors, as well as various chipset series (100 to 500, C230 to C620, X299).
- Intel recommends updating Intel CSME to the latest version and disabling the CPU debug feature and BSP INIT bit.
- The content also includes a CVSS v3.1 vector with a base score of 7.3 (High) for both physical access and adjacent network attack vectors, illustrating the high impact of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was initially found internally by Intel employees and later reported by a third party.
