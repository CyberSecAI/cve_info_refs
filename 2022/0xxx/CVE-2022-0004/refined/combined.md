### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in Intel® Boot Guard and Intel® Trusted Execution Technology (TXT) for some Intel® processors may allow escalation of privilege. Intel is releasing firmware updates and prescriptive guidance to mitigate this potential vulnerability.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2022-0004](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0004)

Description: Hardware debug modes and processor INIT setting that allow override of locks for some Intel(R) Processors in Intel(R) Boot Guard and Intel(R) TXT may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via physical access.

CVSS Base Score: 7.3 High

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N) (Physical, unauthenticated)

CVSS Base Score: 7.3 High

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N) (Adjacent network, authenticated)

### Recommendations:

Intel recommends updating Intel® CSME to the latest version (see provided table).

Intel also recommends following the previously published guidance on disabling the CPU Debug feature when Intel® Boot Guard is enabled. Please consult this [Intel Debug paper](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/software-security-guidance/secure-coding/intel-debug-technology.html) for more details.

Intel also recommends disabling the BSP (Bootstrap Processor) INIT (DBI) bit to enable protections against an INIT bypassing the startup Authenticated Code Module (ACM). This setting change is available in the latest version of Intel® CSME.

Intel recommends that users of Intel® CSME update to the latest version provided by the system manufacturer that addresses these issues.
