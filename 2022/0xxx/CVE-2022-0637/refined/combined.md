|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Severity:- Medium (Score:- 5)

Vulnerable URL:- <https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com>

Description:-

Open redirection vulnerabilities arise when an application incorporates user-controllable data into the target of a redirection in an unsafe way. An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behavior can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain

Step to reproduce:-

1. Open <https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com/v1/> on any browser
2. Then replace /v1/ with /%0a/evil.com/projectX.htm/
3. So now the final URL will be [https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com/%0a/evil.com/projectX.htm/](https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com/%0A/evil.com/projectX.htm/) send it to any victim when he clicks on it it will redirect to [www.evil.com/projectX.htm](http://www.evil.com/projectX.htm)

Impact:-

Url Redirection or Unvalidated Open Redirects are usually used with phishing attacks or in malware delivery, it may confuse the end-user on which site they are visiting.

1. Attackers could redirect victims to vulgar sites such as Porn sites which can degrade the reputation of your site, as the redirection happened from your domain.
2. Attackers could deliver malware or phishing pages in the name of your website & hence cab steal user credentials.

As front part, if the URL is legitimate, an attacker can easily convince users to click on maliciously crafted link, and hence could easily target users of pollbot.services.mozilla.com

Actual results:

Application is not validating domains after /%0a/and its leads to open redirect.

Impact:-

Url Redirection or Unvalidated Open Redirects are usually used with phishing attacks or in malware delivery, it may confuse the end user on which site they are visiting .

1. Attackers could redirect victims to vulgar sites such a Porn sites which can degrade the reputation of your site, as the redirection happened from your domain.
2. Attackers could deliver malware or phishing pages in the name of your website & hence cab steal user credentials.

As front part if the url is legitimate, attacker can easily convince users to click on malicious crafted link, and hence could easily target users of pollbot.services.mozilla.com

<https://hackerone.com/reports/504751>

Mitigation:-

<https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html>

Expected results:

The application should not redirect the user to the malicious domain

Hello Samprit,

Thank you for your report.

I have added the necessary flag to consider this bug in our web bug bounty program, for future reference, please use the bug bounty form when opening bugs: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.web.bounty>

I was able to reproduce the issue using `https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com/%0A/duckduckgo.com/`, note the URL needs to end in `/` for the redirection to work.

Thanks,

Frida

Hello Frida,

pollbot is used by <https://github.com/mozilla/delivery-dashboard/>, which in turn is used by Release Management. I don't know if there are other clients.

Hello Team,

As the vulnerability is fixed and here in <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-21354> I can see pollbot allows to register CVE for fixed vulnerabilities based on its version so can you register a CVE with my name for this fix vulnerability?

And also team can you please tell me will this report will get eligible for a reward?

Regards,

Samprit Das

Tom's comment was addressed to me (he added a "needinfo" for me). The "CNA" who issued the CVE (in this case, Mozilla) is responsible for reporting the details through a defined process.
