    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability occurs in the `tif_dirread.c` file at line 4176 within the `TIFFReadDirectory` function where `memcpy` is called. The issue arises when the source pointer for memcpy is NULL. The fix involves checking for the null pointer condition before calling memcpy. The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted TIFF file with specific characteristics that causes the source pointer to be NULL. This issue is addressed in libtiff version 4.4.0 and later.  The issue was fixed in commit `561599c9` of the libtiff repository."
