  "cve": "CVE-2022-0850",
  "description": "The provided data reveals a kernel information leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `copy_page_to_iter` function, specifically within the `iov_iter.c` file. This vulnerability was identified by syzkaller. The root cause of the issue is related to how `ext4_extent_header` structures are initialized, which can leak uninitialized data to user space. The fix is implemented by initializing the `eh_generation` field of the `ext4_extent_header` structure. The vulnerability can be triggered during read operations involving the affected functions/modules.",

  "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability lies within how the `ext4_extent_header` structure is initialized, leading to an information leak due to an uninitialized `eh_generation` field which results in uninitialized kernel memory being copied to userspace when using the `copy_page_to_iter` function.",

  "impact": "A local attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read kernel memory and cause a denial of service by accessing the leaked information.",
  "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves triggering the vulnerable `copy_page_to_iter` function, typically by initiating a read operation that utilizes the affected ext4 code.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "A local attacker with the ability to trigger specific file read operations can exploit this vulnerability."
