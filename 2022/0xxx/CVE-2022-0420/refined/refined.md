Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-0420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization and escaping of the `rm_form_id` parameter before it is used in a SQL query within the Automation admin dashboard of the RegistrationMagic plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. Input from the `rm_form_id` parameter is directly embedded into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the WordPress database.
- This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized data modification, and potentially complete compromise of the WordPress site.
- The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates the ability to inject a `sleep()` function, indicating the possibility of time-based SQL injection, which can allow for data extraction.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `rm_form_id` parameter in the `admin.php` page with the `rm_ex_chronos_manage_tasks` query parameter
- The vulnerability is exploitable via both GET and POST requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges within the WordPress site to access the vulnerable admin dashboard.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was found in versions of the RegistrationMagic plugin prior to 5.0.2.2.
- The fix was implemented by sanitizing the `rm_form_id` parameter with `absint()`, which ensures the parameter is an integer, preventing SQL injection.
- The provided changeset includes the code changes that were made to mitigate the vulnerability. These changes include casting the `rm_form_id` parameter to an integer in several files, and applying `sanitize_text_field()` to other parameters.
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS score of 6.8.
- The vulnerability was reported by qerogram.
- The vulnerable code is located in `plus/chronos/controllers/task_controller.php`, `plus/chronos/services/service.php`, and `plus/chronos/libs/rm_chronos.php`.
