### Root cause of vulnerability
The `item_id` parameter in the `/wc/v3/wishlist/remove_product` REST endpoint is not sanitized or escaped before being used in a SQL query.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
- Unauthenticated Blind SQL Injection

### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service. The provided proof of concept demonstrates that a time-based blind SQL injection is possible.

### Attack vectors
- Sending a malicious request to the `/wc/v3/wishlist/remove_product` REST endpoint with a crafted `item_id` parameter.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
