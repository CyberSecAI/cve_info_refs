- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of exceptional conditions in the GlobalProtect app's Connect Before Logon feature when using SAML authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to properly handle exceptional conditions during the authentication process, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability. Specifically, it is related to CWE-703 Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can escalate privileges to SYSTEM or root level. This could enable the attacker to gain full control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the system. The vulnerability is triggered when authenticating with Connect Before Logon under certain circumstances, specifically when SAML authentication is enabled. The attacker does not require any user interaction or special privileges.
