- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin does not properly sanitize and escape parameters before using them in SQL statements. This occurs within various AJAX actions, some of which are accessible to unauthenticated users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability due to lack of proper sanitization of input parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform SQL injection attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data within the database. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to extract user login and password hashes from the `wp_users` table, which can lead to a complete compromise of the WordPress installation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint, specifically targeting the `rt_ubigeo_load_distritos_address` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
