  "cve": "CVE-2022-0567",
  "description": "A flaw was found in ovn-kubernetes. This flaw allows a system administrator or privileged attacker to create an egress network policy that bypasses existing ingress policies of other pods in a cluster, allowing network traffic to access pods that should not be reachable. This issue results in information disclosure and other attacks on other pods that should not be reachable.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "OCP v 4.10.8",
    "OCP v 4.9.27",
    "OCP v 4.7.47",
    "OCP v 4.8.36"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because an egress network policy can override existing ingress policies in ovn-kubernetes.",
  "weaknesses": [
    "Improper access control due to incorrect network policy enforcement."
  ],
  "impact": "A system administrator or privileged attacker can bypass existing ingress policies by creating a malicious egress network policy, leading to information disclosure and unauthorized access to other pods within the cluster.",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "Creation of a malicious egress network policy."
  ],
  "required_capabilities": [
    "System administrator or privileged attacker access to create egress network policies."
  ],
    "additional_details": "The attack is limited to pods on the same node."
