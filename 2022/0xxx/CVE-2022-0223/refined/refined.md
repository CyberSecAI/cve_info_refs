- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory ('Path Traversal').
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-22 Path Traversal vulnerability allows creating or overwriting critical files used for code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Remote code execution, loss of data integrity and confidentiality.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by creating or overwriting critical files used to execute code, such as programs or libraries. This could lead to unauthenticated code execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to cause the application to perform a path traversal attack by crafting a specific file path. This attack can be done remotely but requires a user interaction.
