Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2022-0835

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the **cleartext storage of sensitive information in memory (CWE-316)**. Specifically, the application stores network user account credentials and logged-in user credentials in cleartext within the system's memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** Credentials, such as passwords for network user accounts or logged-in users, are stored in an unencrypted format in the system memory.
* **Exposure via Memory Dumps**: Credentials can also be exposed in diagnostic memory dumps if the dumps are saved in a location that is accessible to unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Compromise of Credentials:** An attacker with local access or access to memory dumps can gain access to sensitive credentials, leading to unauthorized access to the system, data, or connected networks.
* **Lateral Movement:** If network user account credentials are exposed, an attacker could potentially move laterally within the network.
* **Data Breach:** With exposed credentials, an attacker may gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources on the affected system or network.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Access:** An authorized, low-privilege user can exploit this vulnerability if they have access to the local machine.
* **Memory Dump Analysis:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information if they can access diagnostic memory dumps saved in unprotected locations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of authorized local access to the affected system. They do not need administrative privileges but must be able to run applications or processes with the affected user's context.
* **Access to Memory Dumps:** The attacker needs to access diagnostic memory dumps saved to non-protected locations. This could be through access to the file system where the dumps are saved, or through some kind of exfiltration method.

**Additional details:**
* The affected products are:
    * AVEVA™ Application Server
    * AVEVA™ Operations Management Interface (OMI)
    * AVEVA™ Historian and Historian Client
* The vulnerability affects the following versions:
    * AVEVA System Platform 2020 R2 P01
    * AVEVA System Platform 2020 R2S
    * AVEVA System Platform 2020
* The vulnerability is rated as high severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.1.
* The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
* There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
