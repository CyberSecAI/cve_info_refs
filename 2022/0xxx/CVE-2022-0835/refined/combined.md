SECURITY BULLETIN AVEVA-2021-007
Title
System Platform – Cleartext Credentials in Memory and Diagnostic Memory Dumps

Rating
High

Published By
AVEVA Software Security Response Center

Overview
AVEVA Software, LLC. (“AVEVA”) has created security updates for supported versions to address
vulnerabilities in AVEVA™ System Platform 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions. The vulnerabilities could
expose cleartext credentials for the Network User Account of the system, or cleartext credentials for the
logged-in user, to an authorized, low privilege user. The cleartext credentials would also be exposed if
the user creates a diagnostic memory dump of the relevant process and saves it to a non-protected
location where an unauthorized, malicious user can access it.

Vulnerabilities have been addressed in:

•  AVEVA™ Application Server

•  AVEVA™ Operations Management Interface (OMI)

•  AVEVA™ Historian and Historian Client

Recommendations
AVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their
operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

Customers using System Platform 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions are affected and should upgrade to
one of the versions listed below as soon as possible, then apply the corresponding security update:

Version
AVEVA™ System Platform 2020 R2 P01
AVEVA™ System Platform 2020 R2

Security Update
AVEVA™ System
Platform 2020 R2 SP1

AVEVA™ System Platform 2020

AVEVA™ System
Platform 2020 P01

NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3)
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adopted the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS v3) that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
vulnerabilities.  CVSS v3 produces a numerical score as well as a textual representation of that score
reflecting the severity of a vulnerability.  Scores range from 0.0 (no impact) to a maximum of 10.0
(critical impact with minimal effort to exploit). For additional information please refer to the CVSS v3.1
specifications.
