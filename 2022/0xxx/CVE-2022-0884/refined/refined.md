{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin does not sanitize and escape Form Fields titles and descriptions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected fields, which will be executed in the browsers of users who view the related fields, potentially leading to arbitrary actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirects to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker needs to be an administrator or have the capability to add/edit fields in the plugin.",
    "required_capabilities": "Admin or higher level privileges."
  },
  "fix": "The issue was resolved by sanitizing form field titles and descriptions in version 3.6.8 of the plugin.",
  "add_info": {
    "proof_of_concept": "The XSS payload can be injected into a field's Title or Description via the WordPress admin panel. For example, putting `<img src onerror=alert(/XSS/)>` in the 'Name' field's title or description will trigger the XSS in the Profile Builder's Edit Profile and Register pages.",
      "affected_files_details": "The code changes in version 3.6.8 mainly involve adding a `$kses = false` parameter to the `wppb_icl_t` function and setting it to `true` for sanitization purposes. The Select2 library was updated to improve back-end compatibility."
