- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not properly sanitize its settings before outputting them in HTML attributes, leading to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with high privileges (such as admin) can inject malicious JavaScript code into the plugin's settings. When an affected page is viewed by a user, this code can execute, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects the malicious payload into the 'Access Token > User access token' and 'Page access token' settings within the plugin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have high privileges, such as admin access, to modify the plugin settings.
