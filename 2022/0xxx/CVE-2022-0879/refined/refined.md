- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin does not validate and escape the `cf-api` parameter before outputting it in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL using the `cf-api` parameter.
