Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `WP Voting Contest` plugin not properly sanitizing and escaping the `post_id` parameter before outputting it in the response of the `wpvc_social_share_icons` AJAX action.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The lack of input sanitization and output encoding allows malicious JavaScript code injected into the `post_id` parameter to be executed in the context of the user's browser.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a variety of malicious activities, such as:
    *   Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying page content or injecting malicious content.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the `wpvc_social_share_icons` AJAX action. This action is available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a payload in the `post_id` parameter and tricks a user into clicking it.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to convince a user to visit a malicious link (e.g. through social engineering, or other forms of phishing), to trigger the execution of the malicious payload.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
