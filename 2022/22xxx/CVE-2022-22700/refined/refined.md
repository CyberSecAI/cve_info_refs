Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `StartAuthentication` resource in CyberArk Identity versions 22.1 and below. The server exposes a response header `X-CFY-TX-TM`. The value of this header has a predictable behavior that differs based on whether the username provided in the authentication request exists within the tenant.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **User Enumeration:** The predictable difference in the `X-CFY-TX-TM` header value allows an attacker to determine if a user exists in the system without requiring authentication.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The server is inadvertently leaking information about the existence of users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User enumeration:** An attacker can compile a list of valid usernames. This information can be used in subsequent attacks (e.g., password spraying, targeted phishing attacks).
*  **Reduced security posture:** User enumeration can enable an attacker to plan for more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/Security/StartAuthentication` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the CyberArk Identity service.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Endpoint:** `/Security/StartAuthentication`
*   **Vulnerable Header:** `X-CFY-TX-TM`
*   **Behavior:**
    *   If the username exists, `X-CFY-TX-TM` value is typically less than 500.
    *   If the username does not exist, `X-CFY-TX-TM` value is typically greater than 1000.
*   **Affected Versions:** CyberArk Identity versions up to and including 22.1
*  **Fixed Version**: CyberArk Identity version 22.2 and above.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided exploit script demonstrates how the vulnerability can be exploited to create a valid user list.
