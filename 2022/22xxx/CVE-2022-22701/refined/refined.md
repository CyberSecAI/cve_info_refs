Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the PartKeepr application's functionality to load attachments using a URL when creating a part. It allows the use of the `file://` URI scheme.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read sensitive files on the server. This includes configuration files, source code, SSH keys, and other sensitive data.
-  Leaking of sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks or system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by providing a malicious `file://` URL when adding an attachment to a part.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the PartKeepr application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in PartKeepr versions up to and including 1.4.0.
- An attacker can potentially read files accessible to the user running the application.
- The issue has been reported and acknowledged, but a patch was not available as of 2022-01-04
