        "Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)",
        "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected content, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or defacement.",
