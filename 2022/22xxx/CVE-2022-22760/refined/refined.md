Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent error messages when importing resources using Web Workers. Specifically, the error message would reveal whether a cross-origin resource was of `application/javascript` content-type or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The error messages provided different information about the content type of cross-origin resources. This allowed attackers to distinguish between `application/javascript` and non-script responses.
- **Cross-Origin Leak (XS-Leak):** By observing the error messages, an attacker could potentially infer information about the content type of the cross-origin resource, even without being able to access the resource itself, thus enabling a type of XS-Search attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** Attackers can use this to determine if a resource exists at a cross-origin location and what its type is.
- **Fingerprinting:** This could potentially be used to fingerprint users through the presence or absence of specific resources.
- **XS-Search attacks:** This information leak can be used to aid cross-site search attacks, where an attacker attempts to infer sensitive information about a user based on the presence or absence of certain resources from other domains.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Workers:** The vulnerability is triggered when importing resources using the `importScripts` function within Web Workers.
- **Cross-Origin Requests:**  The attack relies on attempting to load resources from different origins (domains).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within a web page.
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate Web Worker requests to cross-origin resources.
- The attacker must be able to observe the specific error message produced in the browser.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report ([Bug 1740985](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1740985)) and the related bug report ([Bug 1748503](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1748503)) provide further details about the vulnerability and the fix.
- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the error messages for failed script loads are consistent regardless of the content type. Specifically, the error message was changed to "NetworkError: A network error occurred" for both cases.
- This fix was included in Firefox 97, Firefox ESR 91.6, and Thunderbird 91.6.
