- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from inadequate access control mechanisms in IBM Robotic Process Automation Server, which allows regular users to access certain administrative pages that should be restricted to authorized personnel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control on the admin pages leading to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Regular users can view administrative pages, potentially exposing sensitive information or functionality intended only for administrators.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated regular users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attacker must have a regular user account on the affected IBM Robotic Process Automation server.
