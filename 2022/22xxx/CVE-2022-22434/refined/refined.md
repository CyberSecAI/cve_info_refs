- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the ability of a user with physical access to create a modified API request that leads to the creation of additional objects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is related to insufficient access controls or input validation within the IBM Robotic Process Automation software, allowing for unauthorized object creation via modified API requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could allow an attacker to create unauthorized objects within the system, potentially leading to data manipulation, resource exhaustion, or other unintended system behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is physical access to the system, which allows an attacker to craft and send a modified API request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the system and the ability to intercept/modify API requests.
