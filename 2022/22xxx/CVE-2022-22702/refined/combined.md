### **[alestorm980](/alestorm980)** commented [Jan 4, 2022](#issue-1093412820)

| Bug description In PartKeepr before **v1.4.0**, the functionality to upload attachments using a URL when creating a part, does not validate that requests can be send to local ports, allowing SSRF attacks and port enumeration. Steps to reproduce  1. Go to 'Add Part'. 2. Click on 'Attachments'. 3. Click on 'Add'. 4. Fill the 'URL' field with an url using a local port "<http://127.0.0.1:3306>". 5. Click on the uploaded file in order to download the file and see the content.  Expected behavior The application should not allow access to local ports. Observed behavior Local ports can be access inside the server.
