Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of validation within the PartKeepr application when handling URLs provided for attachments. Specifically, it fails to prevent requests to local ports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): The application's ability to fetch resources based on user-provided URLs without proper validation creates an SSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SSRF Attacks:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to make requests to internal services or local network resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing further attacks against these internal services.
- **Port Enumeration:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to scan for open ports on the server or internal network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves using the "Add Attachment" functionality while creating a part within the PartKeepr application. The attacker inputs a crafted URL that points to a local port (e.g., 127.0.0.1:3306).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the PartKeepr application with the ability to add parts and attachments.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects PartKeepr versions up to and including v1.4.0.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Oscar Uribe from the Offensive Team of Fluid Attacks.
- The issue is tracked on GitHub at: <https://github.com/partkeepr/PartKeepr/issues/1230/>
- There is no available exploit, but it can be manually exploited.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 4.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) which suggests low impact on confidentiality and no impact to integrity and availability.
