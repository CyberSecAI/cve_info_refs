- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient verification of data authenticity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Vulnerability in the BIOS firmware update process that allows for the installation of modified BIOS firmware due to insufficient verification of data authenticity.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user with high privileges can install modified BIOS firmware. The impact includes the potential for data integrity loss and reduced system availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be authenticated with high privileges on the local system.
