Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `mod_extforward_Forwarded()` function of the `mod_extforward` plugin in lighttpd.
*   The function parses the "Forwarded" header and uses an `offsets` array to store parameter offsets.
*   A loop iterates through the header, and when a comma (`,`) is encountered, it attempts to store -1 in the next offset in the offsets array.
*   The vulnerability occurs because there is insufficient bounds checking on the index `j` when storing the -1 value into the offsets array, leading to an out-of-bounds write if there are too many commas in the Forwarded header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The code writes a value of -1 beyond the allocated space of the `offsets` array on the stack. Specifically the write is always 4-byte -1.
*   The size of the array `offsets` is 256 integers. The code increments `j` before writing the -1 value. The check `if (j >= (int)(sizeof(offsets)/sizeof(int))) break;` was incorrectly placed and did not prevent `j` from reaching 256 (the size of the array) before writing to `offsets[256]`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash of the lighttpd server. However, this was only observed on 32-bit builds when compiled with `-fstack-protector-strong` or `-fstack-protector-all`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious "Forwarded" header:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP request with a specially crafted "Forwarded" header containing many commas.
*  The attack vector is remote and sent via a HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable lighttpd server.
*   The `mod_extforward` module must be enabled.
*   The `extforward.headers` configuration must include "Forwarded".
*   The `mod_extforward` must be configured to trust the upstream proxy server.
* The lighttpd server must be a 32-bit build with `-fstack-protector-strong` or `-fstack-protector-all`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects lighttpd versions 1.4.46 to 1.4.63.
*   The issue is triggered by writing a fixed value of -1 out of bounds, not attacker controlled data.
*   The vulnerability is not triggered by default lighttpd configurations.
*   The fix involves adding a check to ensure `j` does not exceed the size of the `offsets` array before writing the `-1`.
* The vulnerability was initially reported as a stack overflow but was later clarified to be an out-of-bounds write.
* There was discussion on the practical impact, the need for specific compiler flags to trigger a crash, and the fact that the "Forwarded" header is not commonly used in popular CDNs and proxies.
* The reporter of the bug applied for a CVE without properly coordinating with the lighttpd developers.
