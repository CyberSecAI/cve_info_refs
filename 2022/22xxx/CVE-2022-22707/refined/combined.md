The mod\_extforward\_Forwarded() function of the mod\_extforward plugin has a four-byte stack overflow

```
static handler_t mod_extforward_Forwarded (server *srv, connection *con, plugin_data *p, buffer *forwarded) {

    int offsets[256];/*(~50 params is more than reasonably expected to handle)*/
    ...
    while (i < used) {
        ...
        // When "j = 255", "offsets[++j] = -1" means "offsets[256] = -1", causing a stack overflow

        if (s[i] == ',') {
            if (j >= (int)(sizeof(offsets)/sizeof(int))) break;
            offsets[++j] = -1; /*("offset" separating params from next proxy)*/

You are correct that there is an out-of-bounds write on the stack.
However, this out-of-bounds write is not controlled by the attacker.
The value that is written out-of-bounds after the end of offsets[] is -1

However, with the default lighttpd build with `gcc -O2`, I was unable to
trigger a crash in lighttpd on amd64 (64-bit) or on i686 (32-bit).

As with your prior posts, I think your test toolchain is configured
with a stack canary which crashes when an out-of-bounds read or write
is detected, which is fine for your research, but not necessarily a
reflection of real-world impact. When mod\_extforward.c is compiled with
`-fstack-protector-all -fstack-protector-strong`, I was able to trigger
a crash in lighttpd on i686 (32-bit), but not amd64 (64-bit), using the
reproducer (exp.py) you had provided.

Also, the scenario in which this occurs is not enabled by default in lighttpd.

* First, the user must be using mod\_extforward. (not default)
* Second, the user must explicitly configure `extforward.headers`
   to contain "Forwarded" (not default)
* Third, the user must have configured mod\_extforward to trust the
   upstream proxy server which proxied the request to lighttpd,
   and from which lighttpd is receiving the "Forwarded" header.
   This upstream proxy must allow and use this unusual "Forwarded"
   header.

Your statement that this issue affects lighttpd 1.4.41-1.4.63 is incorrect.
Support for the "Forwarded" header was added in lighttpd 1.4.46.
<https://redmine.lighttpd.net/issues/2703>
I have updated your original post.

Given this initial assessment (not yet complete), I have changed the
the wording of this issue to tone it down from vulnerability to OOB write.
There is a bug that will be fixed, but unless further information comes to
light, this does not appear to have security implications for default usage
of lighttpd. Please help me determine in which scenarios and platforms
this might have an impact.

I'm using the ubuntu 20.04 default configuration, where canary is turned on by default

The reason why 64-bit programs can't crash is that sse 16-bit alignment, when closing intel sse, 64-bit programs will also crash, so please make sure that mips, arm and other architecture programs will not trigger a crash.

So compiling 32-bit lighttpd within an operating system with a higher gcc version, or compiling and using lighttpd with an architecture that does not support sse 16-bit byte alignment, will result in a denial of service

You seem to be overlooking the prerequisites to reaching the bug. Case in point, I wrote:

For someone to want to configure lighttpd this way, they must be using a proxy which supports "Forwarded". Do you know of real-world use in popular CDNs? Most CDNs and cloud providers have their own custom fields for X-Forwarded-For.

I took a quick look and Cloudflare does not currently support Forwarded.
<https://community.cloudflare.com/t/support-for-http-forwarded-header-as-a-replacement-for-x-forwarded-for/320943>
Nor does HAProxy (where the HAProxy "PROXY" protocol is often preferred)
<https://github.com/haproxy/haproxy/issues/575>

I did find that "Forwarded" is implemented in
<https://microsoft.github.io/reverse-proxy/articles/transforms.html#forwarded>
though a developer noted it is not enabled by default
(<https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/5978#issuecomment-668013246>)
and "Forwarded" is implemented in
<https://github.com/gorilla/handlers/blob/master/proxy_headers.go>

Please keep in mind that my questions here and above are to help gauge potential impact of the bug.

Thus far, based on what I have posted here and above, I am confident that the bug is not reachable in **common** use scenarios of lighttpd mod\_extforward.

I noticed that "https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs\_ModExtForward" mentions a custom setting for "Forwarded", which is not really the default configuration, but I mean that for users with such a configuration, remote denial of service is possible.

This is a bug and the bug has been acknowledged. I am not sure what your posts are trying to say beyond that.

My posts have repeatedly stated that I am trying to gauge the potential impact, and thus far the potential impact in the real world appears to be very low.

I hope you will listen to me carefully, you said he will not be triggered by default, I agree. Also you said that canary must be turned on to trigger a crash, I told you that canary is turned on by default in higher versions of gcc, and that crashes are possible for system architectures that do not have SSE turned on.

Please help me to understand why you feel disrespected by these grounded statements. Impact analysis is an important part of bug and security triage.

I don't think you've just listened carefully to my analysis, and there are differences between our two concerns. Impact exclusion is indeed a very important aspect, and I agree with your analysis above

Would you please describe your concerns in more detail?

Your post is less than 5 hours old and I have spent a considerable amount of time reviewing, reproducing, and analyzing the potential impact, and have tried to be explicit in my posts that these are the steps I am taking. If you feel that I am giving it short thrift, then please describe your expectations in more detail.

Yes, for systems and distros which enable the canary by default, and if the prerequisites to reach the bug are met, then the bug will trigger a crash.

Please attach a patch (e.g. output from `git format-patch`) with the patch in your original post and how you'd like to be credited. The patch looks good, and I'll need to edit the commit message a bit, but will try to preserve what you'd like to include.

It's late here and I'll return to this tomorrow.

You did not include a commit message in the attachment. Please see the lighttpd git history for how I credit contributors and let me know if you would like any different.

What do you mean by "please trace"? Is that an incomplete sentence?

I have a feeling that you are disappointed that my analysis indicates that this bug is low severity, as its prevalence in production is likely to be rare and specialized. Even when the bug is reachable, I do not believe it exploitable beyond triggering a crash. I will dispute the CVE if you represent the bug otherwise.

I applied for cve with a remote denial of service error type, which I think is reasonable, emm. I would like to know if you agree.

I do not understand your slang. What is "emm"?

**On to the more important issue: context.**

> I applied for cve with a remote denial of service error type [...]. I would like to know if you agree.

The CVE should be specific, not vague.
The CVE should not be worded in an inflammatory or click-bait manner.

You have found a bug in lighttpd mod\_extforward when "Forwarded" is configured.
(Thank you for reporting the bug.)

lighttpd is a modular web server. The distinction between the lighttpd core
and lighttpd modules is important, as is the popularity of any given lighttpd
module.

---

DRAFT:

**There is a potential remote denial of service in lighttpd mod\_extforward under
specific, non-default and uncommon 32-bit lighttpd mod\_extforward configurations.**

Under specific, non-default and uncommon lighttpd mod\_extforward configurations,
a remote attacker can trigger a 4-byte out-of-bounds write of value '-1' to the
stack. This is not believed to be exploitable in any way beyond triggering a
crash of the lighttpd server on systems where the lighttpd server has been built
32-bit and with compiler flags which enable a stack canary --
gcc/clang -fstack-protector-strong or -fstack-protector-all, but bug not visible
with only -fstack-protector.

With standard lighttpd builds using -O2 optimization on 64-bit x86\_64,
this bug has not been observed to cause adverse behavior, even with
gcc/clang -fstack-protector-strong.

For the bug to be reachable, the user must be using a non-default lighttpd
configuration which enables mod\_extforward and configures mod\_extforward
to accept and parse the "Forwarded" header from a trusted proxy. At this
time, support for RFC7239 Forwarded is not common in CDN providers or
popular web server reverse proxies. It bears repeating that for the user
to desire to configure lighttpd mod\_extforward to accept "Forwarded", the
user must also be using a trusted proxy (in front of lighttpd) which
understands and actively modifies the "Forwarded" header sent to lighttpd.

lighttpd natively supports RFC7239 "Forwarded"
hiawatha natively supports RFC7239 "Forwarded"

nginx can be manually configured to add a "Forwarded" header
 <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/forwarded/>

A 64-bit build of lighttpd on x86\_64 (not known to be affected by this bug)
in front of another lighttpd will detect and reject a malicious "Forwarded"
request header, thereby thwarting an attempt to trigger this bug.

The following servers currently *do not* natively support RFC7239 Forwarded:
 nginx
 apache2
 caddy
 node.js
 haproxy
 squid
 varnish-cache
 litespeed

Given the general dearth of support for RFC7239 Forwarded in popular CDNs
and web server reverse proxies, and given the prerequisites in lighttpd
mod\_extforward needed to reach this bug, the number of lighttpd servers
vulnerable to this bug is estimated to be vanishingly small. Large systems
using reverse proxies are likely running 64-bit lighttpd, which is not known
to be adversely affected by this bug.

In the future, it is desirable for more servers to implement RFC7239 Forwarded.
lighttpd developers would like to thank povcfe for reporting this bug so that
it can be fixed before more CDNs and web servers implement RFC7239 Forwarded.

My testing on 32-bit ARM and on 64-bit ARM appears to have the same behavior as i686 (32-bit) and x86\_64 (64-bit)

My builds use gcc and the default build settings in lighttpd configure.ac, which include `-O2`

When built from source, lighttpd does not crash on 32-bit or 64-bit, on ARM or i686 or x86\_64.
When built from source with `--enable-extra-warnings` (which enables `-fstack-protector` in lighttpd configure.ac), lighttpd does not crash on 32-bit or 64-bit, on ARM or i686 or x86\_64.

When built with `-fstack-protector-strong` or `-fstack-protector-all`, then I am able to trigger a crash in lighttpd built **32-bit** on ARM and i686, but 64-bit on ARM or x86\_64 builds do not crash.

As expected, the behavior appears to be the same if clang is used with these flags instead of gcc.

Conclusion: in addition to the prerequisites already noted, it appears that to trigger a crash in lighttpd, lighttpd must be built 32-bit and with `-fstack-protector-strong` or `-fstack-protector-all`. Of course, other platforms may differ. However, the majority of lighttpd usage in production is expected to be on platforms using gcc or clang compilers.

`-fstack-protector-strong` was introduced in gcc 4.9.0.
`-fstack-protector-strong` is present in clang 5.0.0 documentation, and I found references (unverified) to clang 3.8.

As an aside, I tested OpenWRT 32-bit build of lighttpd and it did not appear to be adversely affected by this bug -- it did not crash. The lighttpd OpenWRT package appears to be built with `-fstack-protector`, possibly due to the prevalence of older compilers for some of openwrt-supported hardware platforms.

Note: this bug will automatically be marked fixed once the commit fixing it is pushed to lighttpd git master branch. I am still subscribed and you can still add comments here.

When assigned, please post the CVE number here.

@povcfe

* You did not "collaborate" with lighttpd developers; you merely reported a bug.
   I question your understanding of the meaning of the word "collaborate".
* You did not participate in any research to assess the potential impact.
* **You did not coordinate the CVE release with lighttpd developers.**
   Instead, the CVE was published barely 25 hours after reporting the bug here.
   That is an astounding lack of professionalism, especially considering that
   within a few hours of your report I had responded acknowledging the bug and
   provided an initial assessment. (Also, since you had assumed that this bug
   was a security issue, the bug should have been reported to the security email
   address at lighttpd.net, instead of publicly here.)
* The CVE was published before the proposed fix was committed to the official
   lighttpd git repo.
* The CVE does not clearly state that the impact is limited to 32-bit lighttpd
   and to specific lighttpd mod\_extforward configurations expected to be rare.
   The CVE contains very little information, even though it was published
   (unbeknownst to me at the time) more than 4 hours after my DRAFT post above.
