- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer copy without checking the size of input, also known as a "Classic Buffer Overflow".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the cgi component of Synology Media Server. This occurs because the software does not properly validate the size of input data before copying it into a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is not explicitly specified, but it is described as remote and through unspecified vectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Media Server and does not need any prior authentication or user interaction.
