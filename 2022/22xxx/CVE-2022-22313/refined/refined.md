- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM QRadar Data Synchronization App includes vulnerable components (e.g., framework libraries) that may be identified and exploited with automated tools.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Vulnerable components with known CVEs are present in the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could allow attackers to exploit the vulnerable components.
- **Attack vectors**: Automated tools can be used to identify and exploit the vulnerable components.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires the ability to use automated tools to scan for and exploit vulnerabilities.
