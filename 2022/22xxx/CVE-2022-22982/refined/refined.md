Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2022-22982:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The documents explicitly mention CVE-2022-22982 as a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability affecting VMware vCenter Server.
   - VMSA-2022-0018 is directly related to CVE-2022-22982 and provides details about the vulnerability and its remediation.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability**
   - The root cause is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability present in VMware vCenter Server.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   - The core weakness is the presence of an SSRF vulnerability, allowing an attacker to make requests to arbitrary URLs, potentially exposing internal services.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
    - The vulnerability allows a malicious actor with network access to port 443 of the vCenter Server to exploit the SSRF vulnerability
    - This could allow accessing URLs outside of vCenter server or accessing internal services.
    - The impact of exploitation is listed as "moderate" with a CVSS base score of 5.3, with confidentiality impact listed as low (C:L)

**5. Attack Vectors**
   -  The primary attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have network access to port 443 of the vCenter Server.
   -  The attacker crafts a malicious request that is sent to the vCenter server which in turn executes the forged request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - The attacker needs network access to the vCenter Server (specifically port 443)
   - No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, indicating that it could be exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker.

**7. Resolution**
   - Patches are available for affected versions. The following versions address the vulnerability:
     - vCenter Server 7.0 U3f
     - vCenter Server 6.7 U3r
     - vCenter Server 6.5 U3t
   - VMware Cloud Foundation also has patches detailed in KB articles:
     - VCF 4.x: [KB88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287)
     - VCF 3.x: [KB88995](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88995)

**8. Additional Notes**
    - vCenter 7.0u3f updates may introduce a functional issue for customers using IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication). [KB89027](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89027) details this issue and the workaround.
   - Upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0 U3f might fail due to a Security Token Service (STS) issue when joined to an Active Directory domain, using IWA as identity source. A workaround is given using KB 89027

**Summary**
The documents confirm that CVE-2022-22982 is an SSRF vulnerability in VMware vCenter Server. Exploitation involves an unauthenticated attacker with network access sending malicious requests, potentially leading to the exposure of internal services. Patches are available for vCenter Server versions 7.0, 6.7, and 6.5, along with specific guidance for VMware Cloud Foundation environments. There are potential issues with IWA after patching to version 7.0 U3f which are addressed via a workaround, and potential issues with the STS service in version 7.0 U3f for environments using IWA.
