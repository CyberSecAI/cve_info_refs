#### Issue/Introduction

This article lists individual product updates, also known as async patches, that can be applied to VCF environments with the help of [Async Patch Tool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html). Async Patch Tool is a CLI utility which helps automate patch steps and enables users to apply these patches using SDDC Manager's in-product LCM automation, without impacting future upgrades.

This article outlines two key details

1. VCF releases versions can support a given async patch
2. VCF releases that patched environments can upgrade the full SDDC stack to, without the risk of downgrading critical fixes applied via async patches or propagating stale configurations

Refer to the [Async Patch Tool documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html) for detailed instructions on how to:

* Download Async Patch Tool.
* Apply an async patch.
* Upgrade an async patched version of VMware Cloud Foundation.

For more information about known issues, see the [Async Patch Tool Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/rn/async-patch-tool-release-notes/index.html).

Symptoms:

* A VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) environment needs a critical security patch or bug fix, but you are not ready to upgrade the full SDDC stack to a new VCF version which includes this fix.
* After applying individual product patch(es) to VCF environment in the past, now you want to upgrade to new VCF version.
* **VMSA-2023-0023 Online AP Tool Remediation Steps:**[KB-95284](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=327206)
* **VMSA-2023-0023 Offline AP Tool Remediation Steps:**  [KB-95287](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=327210)

**NOTE: Prior to applying any patches, please review** [KB 95536](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=314663) **and implement the corrective action.**
**NOTE: For VCF on VxRail environments, prior to applying any patches complete the pre-requisites as per** [KB-91830](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?articleNumber=324139)

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2.1

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.4.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.5.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 5.0.x

VMware Cloud Foundation 5.1.x

#### Cause

<https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX/4.1.2.5/rn/vmware-nsx-4125-release-notes/index.html>

#### Resolution

#### **Terminology**

l **Product Version**
The product patch you wish to apply on a VCF instance.

l **Patch Identifier**
<*Product Type*>:<*Product Version*>
Patch details to be passed as an argument to AP Tool --patch or --download options, used to uniquely identify the correct bundle artifacts to download and/or apply.

l **Patch Bundle Name**
The name identifier of the bundle, as seen on the VMware Depot.

**l Install Bundle Name**
Will be required only when SDDC Manager is on 5.2 version.

The install bundles for the versions of NSX Manager and vCenter Server that are running in the management domain must be available in SDDC Manager 5.2 before you can create a VI workload domain. For example, if you have patched the versions of NSX Manager and/or vCenter Server in the management domain to a version higher than what is listed in the BOM, you must download the new install bundles. See [Downloading Install Bundles for VMware Cloud Foundation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/5.2/vcf-admin/GUID-7F2C072D-D220-4C85-970D-FC6F62E37895.html).

l **Supported VCF SKU**
The type of VCF environment that the patch can be applied to. Below are 2 types of supported VCF SKUs:
1. VCF
2. VCF on VxRail

l **Prerequisites**
Any prerequisite steps that are required to be performed on the system prior to enabling the specified patch.

l **Minimum Target VCF Release**
The minimum recommended VCF release to upgrade to after applying a patch.
Example: If the minimum target VCF release is 4.5.x, then you must use a target VCF release of 4.5.0.0 or newer when enabling the future upgrade path.
**Note:** \* If you have applied multiple async patches to your VCF environment, look up the target VCF release recommended for each one and choose the highest of those. This is the target VCF release you should upgrade to, at minimum.

Applying an async patch to update a BOM component does not guarantee support for features introduced in the new version of the component. SDDC Manager supports the same features with the new version of the BOM component as it supported with the older version of the BOM component.

If you are looking for an individual product patch that is not listed or is not compatible with your environment, please contact VMware Support. Additionally, if you have applied a patch to your environment and would like to upgrade to a target VCF release that is not listed as being compatible, please contact VMware support.

#### Additional Information

Please refer to the [Async Patch Tool](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/services/ap-tool/GUID-49818DF1-94EA-4C85-8CB6-6EFFCE5F8060.html) for detailed instructions on utilizing the CLI tool to enable patches and enable forward upgrades in your VCF environment.

#### Issue/Introduction

The purpose of this article is to provide guidance to upgrade just vCenter Server appliance.
VCF affected Versions : All VCF 3.x versions
The information contained in this article applies to both VCF on Dell EMC VxRail environments and vSAN Ready Nodes.

Symptoms:
As documented in [VMSA-2022-0018](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0018.html), all versions of the vCenter Server 6.7 appliance that are prior to 6.7 Update 3r are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.
Also, all VMware Cloud Foundation(VCF) 3.x versions 3.x versions are similarly impacted by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.1.2
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.1.1
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.0.0
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.2.1
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.1.0
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.2.2
VMware cloud foundation 3.11.0.1
VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.2.0

#### Resolution

All the documented security issues are resolved in VMware vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3r.

| **VMware Cloud Foundation Version** | **Upgrade Options** |
| --- | --- |
| Prior to 3.11.x | Upgrade to 3.11.x or later and then follow the workaround in the below article |
| 3.11.x | Apply the steps in the Workaround section of this article. |

Workaround:

To workaround the issue, please follow the below mentioned steps:
**Step 1**: **Perform below steps on each VMware vCenter Server VM and each External PSC deployed in your VMware Cloud Foundation environment:**

1. Powered off concurrent snapshots should be taken of all PSC's and VC's in the SSO domain prior to patching.
2. Apply the VMware vCenter server [6.7 Update 3r](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/vsphere-vcenter-server-67u3r-release-notes.html) patch available at the [Product Patch](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/downloads)  page to all external PSCs and vCenter Servers (Management & VI Domain) in the environment.

**Step 2: Perform below steps on each SDDC Manager VM deployed in your Cloud Foundation environment**

1. Login to SDDC manager VM via SSH and sudo to root account
2. Get PSC/VC ID from VCF inventory:

To get vCenter/PSC details from VCF inventory run following command/Curl/API:

**For vCenter Server**

$ curl localhost/inventory/vcenters | json\_pp
Sample Output:
% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
100 353 0 353 0 0 35300 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 3530
[
{
"hostName" : "vcenter-1.vrack.vsphere.local",
"vmName" : "vcenter-1",
"id" : "<vCenter\_Id>",
"version" : "<current version>",
"datastoreForVmDeploymentName" : "vsan",
"domainType" : "MANAGEMENT",
"status" : "ACTIVE",
"bundleRepoDatastore" : "lcm-bundle-repo",
"domainId" : "########-####-####-####-########aab1",
"managementIpAddress" : "10.0.0.6"
}
]

**For PSC**

$ curl localhost/inventory/pscs | json\_pp
Sample Output:
% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
100 756 0 756 0 0 84000 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 84000
[
{"domain" : "vsphere.local",
"bundleRepoDatastore" : "lcm-bundle-repo",
"status" : "ACTIVE",
"vmName" : "psc-2",
"hostName" : "psc-2.vrack.vsphere.local",
"id" : "<psc\_Id>",
"replica" : true,
"version" : "<current version>",
"datastoreName" : "vsan",
"domainId" : "########-####-####-####-########aab1",
"managementIpAddress" : "10.0.0.7",
"subDomain" : "vrack.vsphere.local"
},
{
"managementIpAddress" : "10.0.0.5",
"subDomain" : "vrack.vsphere.local",
"hostName" : "psc-1.vrack.vsphere.local",
"id" : "<psc\_Id>",
"bundleRepoDatastore" : "lcm-bundle-repo",
"domain" : "vsphere.local",
"status" : "ACTIVE",
"vmName" : "psc-1",
"datastoreName" : "vsan",
"version" : "<current version>",
"replica" : false,
"domainId" : "########-####-####-####-########aab1"
}
]

The field "id" in response, corresponds to vCenter/PSC id.
The "version" field for each of the vCenter/PSC provides the current version of the vCenter/PSC.

3. Update VCF inventory for vCenter Servers and PSCs

**Note**: Repeat below commands for all the vCenter Severs with their corresponding vcenter-id that were upgraded.
<SDDC\_Manager\_FQDN >  =  Fully qualified domain name of SDDC manager.
<vCenter\_Id>  = Id of VCENTER for which version is to be updated in VCF inventory
<psc\_Id>  = Id of PSC for which version is to be updated in VCF inventory
The build number of VC/PSC 6.7 Update 3r is 19832974 so this is the version that needs to be inserted into the file i.e. 6.7.0-19832974

**For vCenter Server**

$ curl -X PATCH '<SDDC\_Manager\_FQDN >/inventory/entities/<vCenter\_Id>' -d '{"version":"6.7.0-19832974", "type":"VCENTER"}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json'

**For PSCs**

$ curl -X PATCH '<SDDC\_Manager\_FQDN >/inventory/entities/<psc\_Id>' -d '{"version":"6.7.0-19832974", "type":"PSC"}' -H 'Content-Type:application/json'

4. Verify vCenter Server and PSC versions

**For vCenter Server**

$ curl localhost/inventory/vcenters | json\_pp
Sample Output:
% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
100 353 0 353 0 0 35300 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 35300
[
{
"hostName" : "vcenter-1.vrack.vsphere.local",
"vmName" : "vcenter-1",
"id" : "<vCenter\_Id>",
"version" : "6.7.0-19832974",
"datastoreForVmDeploymentName" : "vsan",
"domainType" : "MANAGEMENT",
"status" : "ACTIVE",
"bundleRepoDatastore" : "lcm-bundle-repo",
"domainId" : "########-####-####-####-########aab1",
"managementIpAddress" : "10.0.0.6"
}
]

**For PSC**

$ curl localhost/inventory/pscs | json\_pp
Sample Output:
% Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current
Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed
100 756 0 756 0 0 47250 0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 47250
[
{
"hostName" : "psc-2.vrack.vsphere.local",
"subDomain" : "vrack.vsphere.local",
"domain" : "vsphere.local",
"id" : "<psc\_Id>",
"vmName" : "psc-2",
"version" : "6.7.0-19832974",
"datastoreName" : "vsan",
"bundleRepoDatastore" : "lcm-bundle-repo",
"domainId" : "########-####-####-####-########aab1",
"status" : "ACTIVE",
"managementIpAddress" : "10.0.0.7",
"replica" : true
},
{
"bundleRepoDatastore" : "lcm-bundle-repo",
"id" : "<psc\_Id>",
"hostName" : "psc-1.vrack.vsphere.local",
"subDomain" : "vrack.vsphere.local",
"domain" : "vsphere.local",
"datastoreName" : "vsan",
"version" : "6.7.0-19832974",
"vmName" : "psc-1",
"managementIpAddress" : "10.0.0.5",
"replica" : false,
"domainId" : "########-####-####-####-########aab1",
"status" : "ACTIVE"
}
]

5. Go to SDDCManager UI to verify the VC/PSC version after few mins

**Note:**
Repeat for all domains in your Cloud Foundation environment.
Every time a new VI workload domain is created, these steps need to be performed.

Resolved Issues

The resolved issues are grouped as follows.

Security Issues

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Security Issues

vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3r delivers the following security updates:

The OpenSSL library is updated to version openssl-1.0.2zd.

The Oracle (Sun) JRE and JDK package is updated to version 1.8.0.331.

Eclipse Jetty is updated to version 9.4.45.v20220203.

The Expat XML parser is updated to version 2.4.7.

The libxml2 library is updated to version 2.9.13.

cURL is updated to version to 7.81.0.

Apache Struts is updated to version 2.5.30.

Apache Tomcat is updated to version 8.5.75.

Apache log4j is updated to versions 2.12.4 for JDK 7 and 2.17.1 for JDK 8.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

In the Deploy OVF Template wizard, you get an error on vService bindings when you deploy vSphere Replication appliance of version 8.4 and earlier

If you deploy vSphere Replication appliance of version 8.4 and earlier by using the vSphere Client, you might see a Page Unresponsive error on the vService

bindings step in the Deploy OVF Template wizard. Deployment stops and ultimately fails.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot open the vCenter Server appliance GUI installer on a MAC OS

When you try to open the vCenter Server appliance GUI installer on a MAC OS, you see errors such as Installer is damaged and can't be opened. You should eject

the disk image or ovftool cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.

Workaround: See VMware knowledge base article 79416.

Miscellaneous Issues

VMware Skyline Health screen shows an error instead of system health info

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to Monitor > Skyline Health under a vSAN or vSphere cluster, you see an error such as Unable to query vSphere health

information. Check vSphere Client logs for details.. The issue occurs because in certain environments Skyline Health cannot discover the APIs it needs to collect

data from the vCenter Server system and ESXi hosts.

In the analytics service logs, you see errors such as:

Error while getting the data providers list from: com.vmware.ph.phservice.provider.appliance.ApplianceDataProvidersConnection java.lang.IllegalStateException:

Unable to locate VAPI URI.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues

VM Monitoring does not reset vSphere Fault Tolerance on virtual machines as expected when the guest OS fails

When you enable VM Monitoring in your vCenter Server system, the Fault Domain Manager might not reset vSphere Fault Tolerance on virtual machines as

expected when the guest OS fails.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that VM Monitoring resets vSphere FT on a virtual machine in case of guest OS failure.

vCenter Server High Availability replication displays an alarm that the replication is out of sync

In environments with both Auto Deploy and vCenter HA enabled, in the vSphere Client you might see a false alarm for vCenter HA that replication is out of sync.

When you set up your vCenter HA environment with an embedded Platform Services Controller, vCenter HA performs replication to ensure that the Passive node

is synchronized with the Active node. vCenter HA might misinterpret certain Auto Deploy procedures, such as overwriting Certificate Revocation List (CRL) files,

which triggers the false alarm.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

VMware vSphere Storage DRS might schedule large amount of migrations

In certain environments, you might see series of storage migrations scheduled by the vSphere Storage DRS load balancer without an obvious reason.

Workaround: This issue is resolved in this release. For earlier versions of ESXi 6.7.x, you can set storage automation level to manual to make sure that even if the

load balancer generates recommendations for migration, these do not execute automatically.

A Windows VM with virtualization-based security (VBS) fails with a blue diagnostic screen during migration or start/resume

Only when using the mitigation for CVE-2018-12207 (MCEPSC), the Windows OS of virtual machines with enabled VBS might fail with a blue diagnostic screen

during operations such as migration by using vSphere vMotion or start/resume a VM.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Auto Deploy Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Auto Deploy Issues

PowerCLI cmdlets for vSphere Auto Deploy might throw errors

In vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3r, cmdlets from the VMware.DeployAutomation module might throw error messages such as No sessionId found or vimSessionKey

parameter is missing.

Workaround: Update your PowerCLI package to 12.6.

#### Environment

VMware vCenter Server 7.0.3

#### Cause

This issue is caused due to memory corruption in Secure Token Service (vmware-stsd) when VCSA is joined to Active Directory and is currently using, or has used in the past, Integrated Windows Authentication for identity source.

#### Resolution

This issue is resolved in VMware vCenter Server 7.0 U3g build 20150588, available at [Broadcom Downloads](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/downloads).

**Note:**

* vCenter Server needs to be reverted to a healthy state to apply this patch, applying a patch in already failed state is not feasible.
* [CVE-2021-22048](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0025.html) stands as un-resolved in 7.0 U3g as well, please refer to [VMSA-2021-0025](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0025.html) for more information.

Workaround:
To workaround this issue, the identity source configuration needs to be changed from IWA to "AD over LDAP" or "AD over LDAPs" and remove the VCSA from AD domain.

You may follow the below steps to change the identity source configuration :

* Revert/restore vCenter Server to a healthy state, which was taken before initiating the patch
* Remove the IWA Identity Source configuration
* Remove vCenter Server from the Active Directory domain.

/opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli leave

* Reboot the vCenter Server
* Add the identity source as "AD over LDAP" or "AD over LDAPS"
* Retry the Patching

**Note:**

* This workaround cannot be applied in the Patching failed state, vCenter needs to be reverted to a healthy state, then apply the workaround.
* You may move back to IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication) Identity Source after patching to VMware vCenter Server 7.0 U3g build 20150588
* Detailed steps for each action is available in the documents mentioned in Related Information

The Struts2 Core framework is updated to version 2.5.30.

The libxml2 library is updated to version 2.9.13.

Miscellaneous Issues

Files with extension "flat.ses" display their logical size rather than the actual size

In the vSphere Client, the ESXi console, or by using ESXCLI, you might get a wrong representation of the size of files with extension flat.ses. As a result, you

might make wrong disk capacity considerations, for example for the Lightweight Delta (LWD) data path, which might appear to require much larger disk capacity

than actual.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Slow logins for Active Directory users with many groups

vCenter logins using accounts from Active Directory configured over LDAP identity sources might be slow due to serial searches.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix improves login performance by running many parallel searches instead of serial searches.

I/O filter storage provider remain after you remove an unresponsive ESXi host from the vCenter Server inventory

When you remove an unresponsive ESXi host from the vCenter Server inventory, the UnregisterProvider method might not run for that host. As a result, I/O filter

storage providers remains registered with the vCenter even though the ESXi host is not in the inventory.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that UnregisterProvider method runs even for removed unresponsive ESXi hosts.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Incremental patches of vCenter Server 7.x might fail due to a timeout that prevents the restart of the lwsmd service

The Likewise Service Manager (lwsmd) service, which monitors the vmafdd, vmcad, and vmdird services, has a timeout limit of 60 seconds. If the service fails to

restart within the timeout limit due to a delay in the active threads of the monitored services, incremental patches of vCenter Server 7.x, such as vCenter Server

7.0 Update 2c to VMware vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2d, fail.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix prevents conditions for the lwsmd service timeouts.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Miscellaneous Issues

Upgrade Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Miscellaneous Issues

NEW: Exporting a VM as OVF template to a content library or deploying a VM from a content library might time out and the task fails

In some cases, deployment of an OVF or OVA template from a content library, or importing a vSphere vApp or VM to a content library might fail with an error

such as vim.fault.Timedout. You see the error in vpxd.log and cls.log files.

Workaround: For more information, see VMware knowledge base article 88928.

Upgrade Issues

Patching and upgrades to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3f might fail due to a Security Token Service (STS) error

An issue with STS in environments joined to an Active Directory domain that currently uses, or has used in the past, Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) as

an Identity Source, might prevent patching and upgrades to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3f. The problem does not affect earlier versions of vCenter Server 7.0.x.

When patching to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3f from an earlier version of 7.0.x, in the vCenter Server Management Interface (VAMI), you see the error Exception

occurred in postInstallHook. If you use CLI, you see an error such as An error occurred while starting service 'sts'.

If you upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3f from a 6.x version, in the GUI installer you see the errors A problem occurred while - Starting VMware Security

Token Service or An error occured while starting sts.

Workaround: Follow the steps in VMware knowledge base article 89027.
