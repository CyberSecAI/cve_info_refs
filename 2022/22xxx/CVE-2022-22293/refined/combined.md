### **[Oprh](/Oprh)** commented [Mar 1, 2022](#issue-1155350983)

| Bug There is a proof of concept for a XSS on admin/limits.php for Dolibarr 7.0.2 (see <https://github.com/mustgundogdu/Research/tree/main/Dolibar_7.0.2-StoredXSS>).  It would be useful to have a check/ statement if the problem still exist in newer versions, or it is already fixed (and if so, in which version). Environment Version 7.0.2 Environment OS *No response* Environment Web server *No response* Environment PHP *No response* Environment Database *No response* Environment URL(s) *No response* Expected and actual behavior *No response* Steps to reproduce the behavior *No response* Attached files *No response* |
