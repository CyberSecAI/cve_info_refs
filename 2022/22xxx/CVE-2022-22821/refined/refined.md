- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23) in the ASR WebApp of NVIDIA NeMo, where user-provided input is not properly sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Relative Path Traversal, which allows an attacker to navigate outside the intended directory structure using "../" sequences.
    - Lack of input validation in certain interfaces of the ASR WebApp.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker, with admin privileges on the system where the web app is running, can delete arbitrary directories on the system. This could lead to denial of service or data loss.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malicious requests to the ASR WebApp containing "../" sequences to navigate the file system, leading to arbitrary directory deletion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have:
    - Admin/superuser privileges on the machine running the vulnerable ASR WebApp.
    - Ability to send requests to the ASR WebApp.

The provided content gives more detail than the CVE description by explaining the root cause, the vulnerable component (ASR WebApp), and the specific conditions required for exploitation (superuser privileges and cloning the repo). It also mentions the patch commit and workarounds.
