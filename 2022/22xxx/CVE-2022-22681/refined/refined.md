- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Session fixation vulnerability in access control management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper session management allowing for bypassing security constraints.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can bypass security constraints leading to unauthorized access and manipulation. The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality and integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network attack via unspecified vectors.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  No special privileges are required, but user interaction is needed (UI:R).
