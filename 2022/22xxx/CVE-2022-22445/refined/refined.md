- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker gaining specific levels of access can compromise partition firmware. On POWER9 systems, this occurs via service access to the FSP (Flexible Service Processor). On all affected systems (POWER9 and POWER10), this occurs via administrative authority to a partition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in insufficient access control mechanisms within the PowerVM partition firmware, allowing privileged attackers to compromise the firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the compromise of partition firmware, potentially allowing the attacker to gain control over the affected partitions.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - On POWER9 systems: Service access to the FSP.
    - On all affected systems: Admin authority to a partition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - On POWER9 systems: The attacker must gain service access to the FSP.
    - On all affected systems: The attacker must gain administrative authority to a partition.
