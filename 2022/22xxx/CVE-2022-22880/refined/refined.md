Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection present in the `/jeecg-boot/sys/user/queryUserByDepId` endpoint of the jeecg-boot application.
*   The `realname` parameter in the request is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a classic SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, such as usernames, passwords, or other confidential data, or modify/delete information from the database.
*   The provided example payload attempts to extract the current user information using `current_user()`.
*   The severity could be high depending on the data stored in the database and the level of access the application has.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/jeecg-boot/sys/user/queryUserByDepId`.
*   The attacker can control the `realname` parameter via a crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint `/jeecg-boot/sys/user/queryUserByDepId` of the jeecg-boot application.
*   No specific authentication or authorization seems to be required for the injection itself, suggesting this endpoint is accessible by unauthorized users or can be accessed by an authenticated user with insufficient access control measures.
*   Knowledge of the application and the parameter names are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is located in `\jeecg-boot\jeecg-boot-module-system\src\main\java\org\jeecg\modules\system\controller\SysUserController.java` at line 366.
*   The vulnerability is confirmed to exist in versions <= 3.0 of jeecg-boot.
*   The issue has been marked as fixed and will be included in the next release.
