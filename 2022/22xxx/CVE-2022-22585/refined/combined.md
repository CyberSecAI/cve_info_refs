# [A Mirage of Safety: Bug Finding and Exploit Techniques of Top Android Vendor's Privacy Protection Apps](/en/2021/05/14/A-Mirage-of-Safety-Bug-Finding-and-Exploit-Techniques-of-Top-Android-Vendors-Privacy-Protection-Apps/)

# 0x0 Introduction

In this blog, we will detail our research on Android privacy protection apps. We investigated the privacy protection applications provided by the top five Android vendors and found that many applications do not protect our privacy well.

We proposed three threat models based on our research. And we will show four attack examples for the privacy protection applications.

# [CVE-2020-9971 Abusing XPC Service mechanism to elevate privilege in macOS/iOS](/en/2021/01/11/cve-2020-9971-abusing-xpc-service-to-elevate-privilege/)

*Author: Zhipeng Huo([@R3dF09](https://twitter.com/R3dF09)) of Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab*

# 0x0 Introduction

In this blog, I will detail an interesting logic vulnerability I found in `launchd` process when it is managing the XPC Services. Itâs easy be exploited and 100% stable to get high privilege in macOS/iOS. Because `launchd` is the most fundamental and important component in the OS, the vulnerability would also work even from the most restricted app sandbox. The vulnerability should work before macOS Big Sur and iOS 13.5.

2019-09-12

*This post provides detailed analysis for CVE-2019-8014 which was fixed in Adobe Acrobat Reader / Pro DC recently. Interestingly, itâs a patch bypass of CVE-2013-2729 which was fixed six years ago. This post also discusses how to exploit the vulnerability.*

# [Investigating WinRAR Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-20250) at Internet Scale](/en/2019/02/22/investigating-winrar-code-execution-vulnerability-cve-2018-20250-at-internet-scale/)

# 0x00 Background

As one of the most popular archiving software, WinRAR supports compress and decompress of multiple file archive formats. Check Point security researcher Nadav Grossman recently discovered a series of security vulnerabilities he found in WinRAR, with most powerful one being a remote code execution vulnerability in ACE archive decompression module (CVE-2018-20250).
To support decompression of ACE archives, WinRAR integrated a 19-year-old dynamic link library unacev2.dll, which never updated since 2006, nor does it enable any kind of exploit mitigation technologies. Nadav Grossman uncovered a dictionary traversal bug in unacev2.dll, which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or leak Net-NTLM hashes.

2018-11-13

During this time I have been researching security issues on the browser front end, and I have found dozens of vulnerabilities in browsers such as Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Unicode visual security and IDN homograph attack have also been the subject of my research.

**Author : Kai Song(exp-sky) , hearmen , salt , sekaiwu of Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab**

## âStealing coinsâ

On November 6th, we observed that such a [contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5170a14aa36245a8a9698f23444045bdc4522e0a#code) appeared on Ethereum. After investigation, it was found that a blockchain security vendor issued a contract to let everyone âStealing coinsâ.

[DannyWei, lywang, FlowerCode] of Tencent Xuanwu Lab

Here is a preliminary documentation of the RFG implementation. We will update it once we have new findings and corrections.

We analyzed the Return Flow Guard introduced in Windows 10 Redstone 2 14942, released on October 7, 2016.

# [CVE-2016-1707 Chrome Address Bar URL Spoofing on IOS](/en/2016/10/10/cve-2016-1707-chrome-address-bar-url-spoofing-on-ios/)
