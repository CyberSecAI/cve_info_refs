The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specific XSL tag inside the XML field.\n\nSpecifically, exploiting the second field available in the webpage, you can use Java code to **execute commands on the target**.\n\nDuring a Penetration Testing activity carried out on a custom project developed on the vulnerable framework it was possible to access a **feature whose purpose is to operate on XML and XSLT inputs**.\n\nThe first identified vulnerability is an **XML external entity (XXE) injection**, it allows the authenticated user to **retrieve the content of the target file system** within the context of the portal service user.\nIn the following snippet there is a PoC for this vulnerability:\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY example SYSTEM \"/etc/passwd\"> ]>\n<data>&example;</data>\n```\nAnd as you can see from the image below, by exploiting this vulnerability it was possible to **further enumerate the target**.\n\nThe second identified vulnerability is more severe as it allows **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**. It’s an **Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) injection**.\n\nAnd in fact, as you can see in the image below, **the command has been correctly executed** on the target.\n\nIn order to exploit these vulnerabilities, **you must have access to the application** with an administrative account for which the “Test Trasformazione xsl” feature has been enabled.\n\n## Root cause analysis\n\nBoth these attacks occurs when user-supplied input is processed by a weakly configured XML parser, i.e. **the input is not sanitized properly** and a situation similar to other popular vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) occurs in which all input is then executed without restrictions.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nIf your application make use of XML and XSLT you can reduce the risk of exposure by following few simple guidelines:\n\n* Disable dangerous or not usefult functionality (eg: Runtine:exec)\n* If possible, avoid user-provided input XML and XSLT documents\n* Do not blindly trust user-input without properly sanitize it\n\n## Resolutions from OverIT\n\nUpgrading the OverIT Framework to a level 8 or above can solve the vulnerability completely.\n\nOverIT explains that, apart from the “Test Trasformazione xsl” functionality, the application never blindly trust XML and XSLT documents, so the removal of that page from the specific project implementation solves completely the vulnerability.\n\n",
