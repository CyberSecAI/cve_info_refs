Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22296:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue. The application directly uses user-supplied input (the `id` parameter) to access user objects without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The application uses the `id` parameter in the `manage_user` endpoint to access user data. By manipulating this parameter, an attacker can access and modify data of other users.
- **Lack of Proper Authorization:** The system fails to verify if the user requesting the data or making changes has the required privileges or is the owner of the object identified by the provided `id`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate privileges by accessing and editing information of other users.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or remove other users' data, leading to data integrity issues and potential disruption of service.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to sensitive user information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `id` parameter in the URL of the `manage_user` endpoint.
- **Direct URL Access:** The attacker directly crafts URLs with modified `id` values.
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
- The attacker needs to have an account on the application to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- The attacker does not necessarily need any special privileges or access.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable endpoint is `http://localhost/hprms/admin/?page=user/manage_user&id=3`
- The `id` parameter in the URL is the vulnerable parameter.
- The affected software is "Hospital's Patient Records Management System 1.0" from Sourcecodester.
- The vulnerability is located in the "Change User Function".

This detailed explanation provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and how an attacker might exploit it.
