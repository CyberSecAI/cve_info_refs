## Earlier Releases of VMware Tools

* For earlier releases of VMware Tools, see the VMware Tools [Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tools/index.html) page.

## Before You Begin

* **VMware Tools 12.0.5 supports the following guest operating systems:**
  + `windows.iso` supports Windows 7 SP1 or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 and later.
    - The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package is a prerequisite for installing VMware Tools for Windows 12.0.5 and ships with the VMware Tools 12.0.5 download package. While preparing a Windows guest for installation, VMware Tools runs the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package installer which checks for the presence of a more recent version on the guest. If the guest has a more recent version already present, the package does not install.
       For a 32-bit Windows guest, the prerequisite version is Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (x86) version 14.29.30133.0.
       For a 64-bit Windows guest, the prerequisite versions are Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (x86) version 14.29.30133.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable (x64) version 14.29.30133.0.
    - Installing or upgrading to VMware Tools 12.0.5 is not supported for Windows versions that do not meet the prerequisite. Customers should continue to use VMware Tools 10.2.x or older until they can patch or update their Windows OS to meet the prerequisites for VMware Tools 12.0.5. Refer to Microsoft's update [KB2977003](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) for latest supported Visual C++ downloads.

  A tunnel adapter IP address is shown in vim.vm.GuestInfo.ipAddress, but not in vim.vm.GuestInfo.net NicInfo array.

  This issue is fixed in this release.
* **File Introspection driver (vsepflt) can cause BSOD error in Windows guest virtual machine.**

  In Windows guest virtual machine, a race condition might occur during scanning of files, when a file that is being written to a network path, is also being concurrently accessed.

  This issue is fixed in this release.

## Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

* [VMware Tools Issues](#vmware-tools-issues-known)
* [VMware Tools Issues in VMware Workstation or Fusion](#vmware-tools-issues-in-vmware-workstation-or-fusion-known)
* [VMware Tools Issue in VMware Horizon](#vmware-tools-issue-in-vmware-horizon-known)

**VMware Tools Issues**

* **Installation of Windows Vista, Server 2008, or Windows 7 fails in a virtual machine.**

  Installing a Windows OS Vista, Server 2008, or Windows 7 in a virtual machine with a boot disk on a PVSCSI controller, fails to install the required PVSCSI driver.

  Download the VMware Tools package version 11.1.5 from [https://customerconnect.vmware.com/](https://customerconnect.vmware.com/ "https://customerconnect.vmware.com/"), extract the contents, and use the VMware Tools windows.iso or the floppies for Windows OS Vista or Server 2008.

  Note:

  Users managing ESXi hosts or having a requirement to perform multiple installations of the same Windows OS version on a PVSCSI controller, can see the steps outlined in [KB 84200](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/84200).
* **ICMP related IDFW rules not working.**

  After upgrade to VMware Tools 12.0.0 version, NSX-IDFW customers can find that ICMP related IDFW rules are not working as expected.

  This problem occurs because from VMware Tools 12.x.x version release onwards, ICMP filtering is disabled by default due to ICMP packet loss issue. Refer to [KB 88273](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88273) for enabling registry settings to enable ICMP filtering.
* **VMware Tools upgrade failed with error code 1072 (The specified service has been marked for deletion.)**

  When upgrading VMware Tools to a new version, if the previous version's VMware Tools service is not deleted completely, this incomplete service removal causes installing the new VMware Tools version service to fail and leads to a fatal error for the upgrade.

  When detecting an incomplete service removal to prevent VMware Tools upgrade from failing catastrophically every time, the new service creation will pause and retry to see if the condition clears. The VMware Tools installer will pause for up to 2 1/2 minutes. After this, a fatal error will occur. If the condition clears, the upgrade creates the new service and continues.

  For more information, see [KB 84269](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/84269).

  Workaround:

  Retry installing VMware Tools.
* **After upgrading to a new version VMware Tools with an installer parameter to remove the NetworkIntrospection feature, the old version of the vnetflt or vnetWFP driver service continues to run.**

  After the upgrade, the NetworkIntrospection feature is not present in the system's VMware Tools MSI database, but the feature's vnetflt or vnetWFP driver service still exists.

  Workaround:

  Refer to [KB 78016](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78016).

  Note: This issue applies to VMware Tools upgrades from versions older than 11.1.0 only.
* **VMware Tools upgrade fails on Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 without SHA-2 code signing support.**

  Microsoft has changed Windows driver signing to use the SHA-2 algorithm exclusively starting December 3, 2019. Legacy Windows systems without SHA-2 code signing support fail driver signature verification.

  Workaround:

  Refer to [KB 78708](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78708).
* **Installing or upgrading versions earlier than VMware Tools 10.3.0 to VMware Tools 11.1.x might take longer and Windows OS might need a restart.**

  Installation process might appear to be in progress and displays a message similar to the following:
   ​ "Preparing 'VMware Tools' for installation..."

  During this process, the user might be prompted to restart the operating system.

  Workaround:

  For more information, see [KB 55798](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/55798).
* **Windows Guest VMs may encounter BSoD in NSX environment, when optional NSX File Introspection component is installed**

  Windows Guest VM may encounter BSoD in NSX environment when optional NSX File Introspection component packaged with VMware Tools 12.0.5 is installed and it gets connected/disconnected to NSX host component (nsx-context-mux or vshield-endpoint-mux).

  Workaround:

  For details, refer [KB 89028](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89028).

**VMware Tools Issues in VMware Workstation or Fusion**

* **Shared Folders mount is unavailable on Linux VM.**

  If the **Shared Folders** feature is enabled on a Linux VM while it is powered off, the shared folders mount is not available on restart.

  Note: This issue is applicable to VMware Tools running on Workstation and Fusion.

  Workaround:

  If the VM is powered on, disable and enable the **Shared Folders** feature from the interface. For resolving the issue permanently, edit **/etc/fstab** and add an entry to mount the Shared Folders automatically on boot.

  For example, add the line:

  vmhgfs-fuse   /mnt/hgfs    fuse    defaults,allow\_other    0    0
* **Drag functionality fails to work in Ubuntu.**

  Drag functionality fails to work in Ubuntu 16.04.4 32-bit virtual machines installed using Easy Install. Also, failure of the copy and paste functionality is observed in the same systems.

  Note: This issue is applicable to VMware Tools running on Workstation and Fusion.

  Workaround:

  + Add the modprobe.blacklist=vmwgfx linux kernel boot option.
  + To gain access to larger resolutions, remove svga.guestBackedPrimaryAware = "TRUE" option from the VMX file.

**VMware Tools Issue in VMware Horizon**

* **WDDM driver fails on Windows Update installation when Horizon Agent is installed on Windows 8/Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2008 R2.**

  When Horizon Agent is installed on Windows 8/Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2008 R2, the WDDM driver fails on Windows Update installation.

  The WDDM driver will be made available through Windows Update service, when the driver publication process completes.
