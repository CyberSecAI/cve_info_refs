Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insecure access control within the "Hospital-s-patient-management-system". The system allows a non-admin user to directly access and manipulate user privileges through a specific URL endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application allows direct access to the user management functionality (specifically the user list and editing) via the URL `/hprms/admin/?page=user/list`. This means the system doesn't properly validate the user's role before allowing access to these functions.
- **Lack of Proper Authorization Checks:** The application doesn't verify if the user accessing the admin functionalities actually possesses the necessary administrative privileges. This enables an attacker to bypass role based access controls.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A standard user can directly elevate their privileges to administrator by editing user rights, without requiring explicit admin authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can grant themselves administrator privileges.
- **Data Manipulation:** Once they gain admin privileges, the attacker can add, modify, or delete other user accounts and potentially sensitive patient data within the hospital management system.
- **Complete Control:** The attacker gains full control of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct URL Access:** The attacker simply navigates to the specific admin user management URL (`/hprms/admin/?page=user/list`).
- **Web Browser:** Standard web browser is used as an attack tool.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker only needs to be a valid user within the system and have a valid account with basic user privileges.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable URL:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URL path.
