- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specially crafted SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expression can cause a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way Spring Framework handles user-provided SpEL expressions, which can lead to resource exhaustion when malicious expressions are used.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by providing a crafted SpEL expression, making the application unavailable.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can provide a malicious SpEL expression through user-controlled input, such as HTTP request parameters or form data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply the specially crafted SpEL expression to the application. The attacker can be unauthenticated (publicly accessible).
