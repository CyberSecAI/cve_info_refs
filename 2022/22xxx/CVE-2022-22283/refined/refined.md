Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-22283:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper session management in the Samsung Health Android application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application fails to properly log out a user after the device is removed from inactive devices list. This indicates that sessions are not being terminated correctly when a device is no longer considered active.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially maintain unauthorized access to a user's Samsung Health data even after the user believes they have logged out by removing their device from the inactive devices.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Samsung Health Android application. An attacker could take advantage of the improper session management to maintain access after the associated device is marked as inactive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to have an initial authenticated session with a device registered with the user's Samsung Health account. Then the attacker could possibly retain access to the user's account even if that device is removed from the inactive devices list. This is because the session is not being terminated properly upon removing the device.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided description indicates that the vulnerability is related to the "Remove from inactive device" function.
