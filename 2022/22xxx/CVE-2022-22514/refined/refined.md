- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS protocol communication servers allow authenticated manipulated requests to dereference untrusted pointers. Specifically, crafted communication requests can force a read or write access to a dereferenced pointer contained in the request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-822: Untrusted Pointer Dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  The accesses can lead to local overwriting of memory, and if invalid memory is accessed, it results in a crash. The attacker cannot gain the values read internally nor control the values to be written.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, by sending crafted communication requests to the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the CODESYS server or the online user management of the affected products must be deactivated/not active. They require low skills.
