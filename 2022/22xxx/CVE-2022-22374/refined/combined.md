# Security Bulletin: This Power System update is being released to address CVE-2022-22374

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

POWER9: In response to a security issue with firmware update, this security bulletin is being issued to address Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures issue number CVE 2022-22374. There is no Power System firmware update for this.  Please follow the Remediation and Mitigation steps.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2022-22374](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-22374)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| OPENBMC | OP910 |
| OPENBMC | OP940 |

## Remediation/Fixes

Customers with the products below running OP910, OP920, OP930 or OP940, follow the Mitigation steps:

1) IBM Power System AC922 (8335-GTG)

2) IBM Power System AC922 (8335-GTC, 8335-GTW)

3) IBM Power System AC922 (8335-GTH, 8335-GTX)

4) IBM Power System IC922 (9183-22X)

5) IBM Power Hardware Management Console System Firmware (7063-CR2)

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Use the BMC to learn which firmware versions are currently installed on both the BMC and the host system, then verify these versions match the firmware version most recently uploaded and installed on the BMC.  The firmware versions (sometimes called firmware levels) are given in IBM FixCentral (<https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral>) under the description of each firmware version.

If the firmware versions actually installed do not match the firmware versions intended to be installed, try reinstalling the firmware.  If the versions still do not match, obtain firmware from a trusted source such as your service and support representative or from IBM FixCentral.

Please note that firmware versions may be unexpected due to a number of reasons.  For example: a firmware update operation was not successful, the BMC recovered to a previous firmware version, or the problem described by CVE-2022-22374.
