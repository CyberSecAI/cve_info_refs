##### **3a. OS command injection vulnerability in VMware Carbon Black App Control (CVE-2022-22951)**

**Description**

VMware Carbon Black App Control contains an OS command injection vulnerability. VMware has evaluated the severity of this issue to be in the [Critical severity range](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html) with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [9.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Known Attack Vectors**
