Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22739:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles external protocol dialogs when initiated from an iframe within a background page. Specifically:

- When a background page navigates an iframe to an external protocol URL, the external protocol dialog is incorrectly displayed in the currently focused tab instead of the tab containing the iframe.
- This occurs because the embedder element passed to the dialog box function is `null` when an iframe triggers the navigation. Consequently, the dialog is associated with the selected browser tab instead of the intended iframe tab.
- There is no throttling mechanism or user activation requirement for these dialogs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Tab Association:** External protocol dialogs launched by iframes on background pages are not correctly associated with the originating tab/iframe.
- **Lack of Throttling:** The dialogs are not throttled, allowing them to be repeatedly shown, and are displayed on every focused tab if the user switches. This is not the correct behavior, as a user should not receive a prompt from a website that is not in focus.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **User Confusion and Pressure:** The dialogs appear persistently on any focused tab, potentially pressuring users to accept the external protocol launch.
- **Potential for Misdirection:** The persistent dialogs, even after the initial tab is closed, could lead users to believe that the dialogs are from the browser itself, causing them to trust and proceed with the malicious prompt, despite the correct origin being displayed on Nightly builds.
- **Malicious Protocol Launch:** This can trick users into launching an external program to handle the malicious URL protocol, which could lead to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Background Page:** An attacker would need to create a malicious website that opens a background page.
- **Iframe Navigation:** The background page then navigates an iframe to an external protocol URL (e.g., `calc://`, `mailto://`, etc).
- **Cross-Tab Exploitation:** When the user focuses on any other tab, the dialog box is shown again.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Website Hosting:** An attacker needs to host a malicious website capable of opening a background page with an iframe.
- **Javascript execution:** The website has to have the ability to run Javascript in order to trigger the iframe navigation.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability was initially reported as part of a larger issue related to origin spoofing in external protocol dialogs (CVE-2022-22748).
- The fix involves ensuring the correct embedder element is passed to associate the dialog with the originating iframe and tab.
- The vulnerability is considered "sec-low" due to the initial spammy nature of the repeated prompts, and because the origin is properly displayed, which might put some users on their guard.
- The fix was uplifted to Firefox Beta, ESR and released in Firefox 96, ESR 91.5, and later versions.
