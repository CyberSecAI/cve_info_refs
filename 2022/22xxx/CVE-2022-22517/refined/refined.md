- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS protocol communication servers generate weak channel IDs, which can be easily guessed by attackers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficiently random channel ID generation (CWE-334).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can disrupt ongoing communication by injecting additional packets.
    - Attackers can close existing communication channels.
    - Although injected packets are detected due to session-bound integrity checks, this still leads to the channel being closed.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote exploitation is possible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skills can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
