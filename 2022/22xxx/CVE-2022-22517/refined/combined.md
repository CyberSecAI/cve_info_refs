2  Vulnerability overview

2.1  Type

CWE-334: Small Space of Random Values [7]

2.2  Management Summary

CODESYS protocol communication servers generate weak channel IDs, which can be guessed by attackers to
disrupt ongoing communication.

2.3  References

CVE: CVE-2022-22517 [6]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-78510

2.4  Severity Rating

CODESYS GmbH has rated this vulnerability as high.

The CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.5 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). [8]

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

CODESYS products such as CODESYS Control runtime systems contain communication servers for the
CODESYS protocol to enable communication with clients like the CODESYS Development System. The
channel ID generated by these servers to identify the communication channels is insufficient.

4/6

Advisory 2022-04

Guessing the channel ID allows attackers to disrupt existing communication by injecting additional packets or to
close this channel. Since the overlying session-bound services have additional integrity checks and further own
identifiers used for authentication and authorization, injected packets are detected and also lead to the channel
being closed.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability in CODESYS products.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released version V3.5.18.0, which solves the identified security vulnerability for the
following products:
• CODESYS Control RTE (SL)
• CODESYS Control RTE (for Beckhoff CX) SL
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)
• CODESYS Gateway
• CODESYS Edge Gateway for Windows
• CODESYS HMI (SL)
• CODESYS OPC DA Server SL
• CODESYS PLCHandler
• CODESYS Development System V3
• CODESYS Control Runtime System Toolkit
• CODESYS Embedded Target Visu Toolkit
• CODESYS Remote Target Visu Toolkit

For the below listed products, CODESYS GmbH has released version V4.5.0.0 based on the CODESYS
Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit V3.5.18.20:
• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL
• CODESYS Control for Linux SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL
• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL
• CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600 SL
• CODESYS Edge Gateway for Linux

Version V4.5.0.0 was skipped for the following products. Instead, CODESYS GmbH has released version
V4.6.0.0 based on the CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit V3.5.18.30 to solve the described
vulnerability:
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL
• CODESYS Control for PLCnext SL

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS AddOns can be downloaded
and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer, which is part of the CODESYS Development System as of
version V3.5.17.0.

Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update
in the CODESYS Update area [3].

To make the fix effective, both the CODESYS protocol server and the client must be updated. So CODESYS
GmbH recommends updating all affected products.

Advisory 2022-04

Compatibility information for device manufacturers:
The obsolete marked function NetServerGetChannelInfoByIndex() was removed completely, use
NetServerGetChannelInfoByIndex3() instead. The interface between the CmpChannelClient,
CmpChannelServer/CmpChannelServerEmbedded, CmpChannelMgr/CmpChannelMgrEmbedded components
was reworked, especially the L4 packet structures were redesigned.

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerability.

Currently, CODESYS GmbH has not identified any specific workarounds for this vulnerability, in case the
software update is not applied.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
