- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Juniper Identity Management Service (JIMS) for Windows installation process, specifically a repair operation, creates temporary files in the user's %TEMP% directory. These files are then executed from a SYSTEM context due to the Windows Installer service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure permissions on temporary files created during the repair process. This allows an unprivileged user to manipulate these files before they are executed as SYSTEM.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a local unprivileged attacker to gain SYSTEM level privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker can trigger a repair operation via the Windows Installer API or by running "msiexec.exe /fa c:\windows\installer\[XXXXX].msi". This triggers the creation and execution of temporary files with SYSTEM privileges in the user's %TEMP% directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability. An exploit is considered trivial to produce.
