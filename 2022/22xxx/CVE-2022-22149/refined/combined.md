# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2022-1441

## Lansweeper lansweeper HelpdeskSetupActions SQL injection vulnerability

##### February 28, 2022

##### CVE Number

CVE-2022-22149

### Summary

A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the HelpdeskEmailActions.aspx functionality of Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2. A specially-crafted HTTP request can cause SQL injection. An attacker can make an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Lansweeper lansweeper 9.1.20.2

### Product URLs

lansweeper - <https://www.lansweeper.com/>

### CVSSv3 Score

9.1 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CWE

CWE-89 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command (‘SQL Injection’)

### Details

Lansweeper is an IT Asset Management solution that gathers hardware and software information of computers and other devices on a computer network for management and compliance and audit purposes.

An exploitable SQL Injection vulnerability is related with an action : `Configuration -> General Settings` and is located inside `\LS\CF\HelpdeskSetupActions.cs` file.
Let us take a close look at the vulnerable source code :

```
Line 155	private static void EditSetting()
Line 156	{
Line 157		Page page = (Page)HttpContext.Current.Handler;
Line 158		HttpContext current = HttpContext.Current;
Line 159		JsReturnObject jsReturnObject = new JsReturnObject();
Line 160		try
Line 161		{
Line 162			General.ValidateCsrf();
Line 163			string text = current.Request["field"];
Line 164			Dictionary<string, string> dictionary = new JavaScriptSerializer().Deserialize<Dictionary<string, string>>(current.Request["value"]);
Line 165			object obj = dictionary[text];
(...)
Line 197	else
Line 198	{
Line 199		object obj2 = DB.ExecuteScalar("Select " + text + " from " + text2);

```

As we can see, `field` parameter is not sanitized, and later in `line 199` using string concatenation, it is combined with the SQL query.
To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker must be authenticated and have rights to change any setting related with `Configuration -> HelpDesk Setup`.
