Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22149:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `field` parameter within the `HelpdeskSetupActions.aspx` page, specifically in the `EditSetting()` function. This parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query using string concatenation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection: The unsanitized `field` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can potentially manipulate the database by reading, modifying, or deleting data. In this specific instance, the provided proof of concept attempts to extract the version of SQL server.
- Complete compromise of the system and underlying infrastructure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through HTTP requests to the `/configuration/HelpdeskSetup/HelpdeskSetupActions.aspx` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated and have sufficient privileges to modify settings under `Configuration -> HelpDesk Setup`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `HelpdeskSetupActions.cs` file.
- The `value` parameter is deserialized as a dictionary but the key is extracted and used in the query.
- The specific line of code with the vulnerability is `object obj2 = DB.ExecuteScalar("Select " + text + " from " + text2);` where text comes from the unsanitized request parameter `field`.
- The provided proof of concept demonstrates a time-based SQL injection using `WAITFOR DELAY`.
- The vulnerable version is Lansweeper 9.1.20.2.
