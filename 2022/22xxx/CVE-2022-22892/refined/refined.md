Based on the provided information, this issue relates to a bug in JerryScript, specifically an assertion failure related to the type of a value during the execution of JavaScript code. The issue arises when using arrow functions within class constructors, particularly when accessing `super` properties.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect handling of the `this` binding within arrow functions used inside class constructors, specifically when those constructors also use the `super` keyword to access properties. This mishandling leads to an unexpected value type which triggers an assertion failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect handling of `this` binding in arrow functions.
- Assertion failure due to unexpected value type during execution.
- Vulnerability manifests within the JavaScript engine itself, which may indicate a more severe coding issue, and may cause application crashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program termination: The assertion failure causes the JerryScript engine to halt execution, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- Potential for further vulnerabilities: The issue highlights a potential weakness in the way the JavaScript engine handles `this` bindings and could indicate further issues with object or function contexts.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafting malicious JavaScript code utilizing class inheritance with arrow functions that access `super` properties.
- Executing this crafted code on a system using the vulnerable version of JerryScript.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the vulnerable JerryScript environment.
- Knowledge of the specific syntax required to trigger the issue, involving classes, constructors, super calls, and arrow functions.
