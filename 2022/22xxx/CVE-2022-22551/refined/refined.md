- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Dell EMC AppSync versions 3.9 to 4.3 use the GET request method with sensitive query strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of GET request method with sensitive query strings.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An adjacent, unauthenticated attacker can potentially hijack the victim's session.
- **Attack vectors**: Adjacent network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the victim. They do not need to be authenticated.
