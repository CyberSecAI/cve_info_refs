The provided content is a Gentoo security advisory (GLSA) that mentions CVE-2022-22941 as one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting Salt. However, it does not provide specific details about CVE-2022-22941, instead referring to the CVE identifiers for details.

Therefore, I cannot extract specific vulnerability information about CVE-2022-22941 from this document.
