- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the use of SpEL (Spring Expression Language) injection in Spring Data MongoDB applications. Specifically, when `@Query` or `@Aggregation` annotated query methods use SpEL expressions containing query parameter placeholders for value binding, and the user-supplied input is not sanitized, it creates a vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SpEL Injection. Unsanitized user input is passed directly into a SpEL expression within a query. This allows attackers to inject malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary SpEL expressions, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches or other severe impacts. The vulnerability can be exploited when the application is using `@Query` or `@Aggregation` annotations in repository methods with SpEL parameter placeholders and fails to sanitize user input.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a web application or API endpoint where a user can supply unsanitized input which is then used in a repository method with SpEL expressions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply input that reaches the vulnerable `@Query` or `@Aggregation` annotated method. The attacker also needs to understand the structure of the query and parameters to craft a malicious SpEL expression that can be injected.
