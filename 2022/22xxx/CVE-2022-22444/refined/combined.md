**B. FIXES**

IBM strongly recommends addressing the vulnerability now.

The fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lpd\_fix2.tar
<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lpd_fix2.tar>

The links above are to a tar file containing this signed advisory, fix packages, and OpenSSL signatures for each package. The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX Technology Levels.

| AIX Level | Interim Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 7.1.5.7 | IJ39868s9a.220506.epkg.Z |

| 7.3.0.1 | IJ39877s1a.220506.epkg.Z |

Please note that the above table refers to AIX TL/SP level as opposed to fileset level, i.e., 7.2.5.2 is AIX 7200-05-02.

Please reference the Affected Products and Version section above for help with checking installed fileset levels.

| VIOS Level | Interim Fix |

The fixes are cumulative and address the previously issued AIX/VIOS lpd security bulletin with respect to SP and TL:
<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lpd_advisory.asc>
<https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6467129>

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

tar xvf lpd\_fix2.tar
cd lpd\_fix2

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [file]" command as the following:

| openssl dgst -sha256 | filename |
| --- | --- |

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM AIX Support at <https://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

**C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION**

Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression testing but not the full regression testing that takes place for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html>

To preview an interim fix installation:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -p         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being previewed.

To install an interim fix package:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -X         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being installed.
