{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The NocoDB password-reset feature displays different messages depending on whether the email address provided exists in the application's user database. This allows an attacker to infer user existence based on the response.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Observable Discrepancy (CWE-203)",
        "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection') (CWE-74)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can enumerate valid email addresses of registered users by observing the application's responses during the password reset process. This information can be used for further targeted attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network via the password reset functionality of the NocoDB web application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires no specific privileges or user interaction and can exploit this by simply making requests to the password reset endpoint.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is present in NocoDB versions 0.9 to 0.83.8.  The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.84.0 and later by modifying the password reset response. The fix is referenced in the github commit f46e89b0. "
