Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a hardcoded Shiro encryption key within the `src/main/resources/application.yml` configuration file of the MCMS project. This key is used for serializing and deserializing user session data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Hardcoded cryptographic key:** The primary weakness is the presence of a static, hardcoded Shiro key. This makes it trivially easy for attackers to forge valid serialized session data.
- **Java Deserialization vulnerability:** The Shiro framework uses Java serialization/deserialization for session management. With a known key, an attacker can craft malicious serialized payloads that, when deserialized by the server, lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the MCMS application.
- **Full System Compromise:** In most cases, RCE can lead to a full compromise of the affected system, allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the server and any associated data.
- **Data breach/integrity loss:** Potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or destruction.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is performed by crafting a malicious serialized Java object, encrypting it with the hardcoded key, and sending it to the server as part of a Shiro session cookie.
- The server then decrypts the cookie and deserializes the malicious object, leading to the exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to the application:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable MCMS application to send crafted requests.
- **Knowledge of hardcoded key:** The attacker must know the hardcoded Shiro key, which is readily available in the mentioned configuration file.
- **Ability to craft serialized payload:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious serialized java object, typically using a gadget chain like CB1 or similar, depending on the applicationâ€™s classpath.
