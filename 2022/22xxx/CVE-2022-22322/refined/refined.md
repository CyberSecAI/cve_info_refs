- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in IBM InfoSphere Information Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability allows for the execution of malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the application itself, likely involving injection of malicious code into a field or parameter that is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious scripts into the application, this would likely mean they would have to be in a position to interact with the application directly.
