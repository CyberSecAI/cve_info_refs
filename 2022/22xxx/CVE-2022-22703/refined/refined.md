Based on the provided advisory, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the SSO Agent installer logging the Pre-Shared Key (PSK) and user password in plain text within the installation log file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Plaintext Storage:** Sensitive information (PSK and user password) are stored in plaintext within the installation log.
- **Logging Enabled by Default (in older versions):** In versions prior to 2.1.0, logging is enabled by default, exacerbating the exposure of sensitive credentials. While logging is disabled by default in newer versions (3.0.0+), it can be enabled via command-line argument, which creates the same vulnerability.
- **Insecure Log File:** The generated "install" log file is not protected and can be accessed by unauthorized users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the log file can obtain the PSK and user password in plain text.
- **Integrity Compromise:** With access to these credentials, an attacker could potentially alter the configurations or gain unauthorized access to the system.
- **Availability Impact:** The attacker could cause a denial of service or disrupt the system using the compromised credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the SSO Agent was installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the file system of the machine where SSO Agent was installed.
- **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker needs low privileges to access the install log file.
- **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required for the attacker to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is only present when using the .exe installation file of SSO Agent on Windows OS. The .msi installer is not affected.
- The advisory provides a workaround: deleting the install log file.
- Fixed versions are: 2.1.1 and 3.0.2
- The CVSS score is 7.8 with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
