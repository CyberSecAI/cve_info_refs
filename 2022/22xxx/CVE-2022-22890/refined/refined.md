Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is related to the handling of the `arguments` parameter within the JerryScript engine's parser. The issue arises when a function uses `arguments` as a named parameter, which conflicts with the engine's internal representation of the `arguments` object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Assertion Failure:** The core weakness is an assertion failure triggered in `js-scanner-util.c` at `scanner_pop_literal_pool` when the parser encounters a function with `arguments` as a parameter.
-   **Incorrect `arguments` Object Handling:** The parser fails to properly handle cases where a function parameter is named `arguments`, causing a mismatch in expected internal states related to the presence of the special `arguments` object.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact is a crash due to the assertion failure, resulting in a denial of service. The execution of the JavaScript code will halt when this assertion fails.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **JavaScript Code Execution:** The vulnerability is triggered by crafting malicious JavaScript code that defines a function with `arguments` as a parameter, and then invoking that function. This could be done by any attacker able to execute arbitrary JavaScript in a JerryScript environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** The attacker needs the ability to execute crafted JavaScript code within the JerryScript environment. This includes the ability to provide malicious scripts to the application.

**Technical Details:**

-   The vulnerability occurs in the parsing phase in the `scanner_pop_literal_pool` function, where the engine is attempting to retrieve a literal from the literal pool. The assertion failure is raised if the code path related to creating the argument object is followed, which should not happen if `arguments` is explicitly used as parameter name.
-   The provided test case demonstrates how to trigger this issue.
- The fix involved preventing the creation of arguments object when the arguments parameter is present in function definition.
