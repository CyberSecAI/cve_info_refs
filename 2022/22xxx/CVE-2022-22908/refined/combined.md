# Executive Summary

An issue found in "SangforCSClient.exe", a core component of Sangfor VDI Client v5.4.2.1006 allows attackers to access user credentials via unspecified vectors.

# Technical Summary

To exploit the vulnerability an attacker must get a Full Dump of the "SangforCSClient.exe" process after the user inserted at least one time his credentials and clicked "Log In" button.
After a Log In try any string previously inserted in "Username:" and "Password:" textboxes will be written in plaintext inside the Full Dump near known and standard strings or hex array.

[![CVE-PoF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34677901/155855975-12966ef1-56bd-4c58-939e-26c0d7643e32.gif)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34677901/155855975-12966ef1-56bd-4c58-939e-26c0d7643e32.gif)

IMPORTANT: this local vulnerability can expose useful information to an attacker willing to escalate his privileges. After a successful attack lateral movement can be done via multiple ways.

# Product

Sangfor VDI Client

# Tested Version

v5.4.2.1006

# Details

 **Issue: Sensitive data written in plaintext into process working memory**

After dumping the process Memory you can look for the victim password near the following HEX sequence

Password location is near "based authentication" string, or seen in HEX:

```
62 61 73 65 64 20 61 75 74 68 65 6E 74 69 63 61 74 69 6F 6E

```

the username is usually inside the first part of the memory dump, just like you can see in the following screenshot
