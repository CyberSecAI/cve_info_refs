- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `serialNum` parameter, extracted from a protobuf message, is directly used in a `system()` call without any sanitization or escaping.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS command injection. The `serialNum` from the `MxpManage` message is used in the `doSystemCmd` function, which executes the command with `system()`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device, leading to a complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted network packet to the device's port 9003 with the malicious command embedded within the `serialNum` field of the `MxpManage` protobuf message. The vulnerable code is within the `ucloud_add_node` function, specifically where the `serialNum` value is used in a command execution via the `doSystemCmd` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the vulnerable device to send the malicious packet to port 9003.
