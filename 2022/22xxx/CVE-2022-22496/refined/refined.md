- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Spectrum Protect Server is vulnerable to an offline dictionary attack when using SESSIONSECURITY=TRANSITIONAL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the server's susceptibility to offline dictionary attacks due to the use of SESSIONSECURITY=TRANSITIONAL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access by successfully guessing user credentials through an offline dictionary attack.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted offline, likely by obtaining password hashes and attempting to crack them with a dictionary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need access to the password hashes and the ability to perform offline dictionary attacks.
