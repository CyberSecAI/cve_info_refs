Based on the provided information, this issue relates to a stack overflow vulnerability in JerryScript.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a recursive call within the `ecma_op_function_call_simple` function, specifically when constructing new objects using a function that calls itself recursively. This leads to uncontrolled stack growth and eventually a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled recursion: The vulnerability arises from the lack of a check to prevent unlimited recursive calls when constructing new objects.
- Stack overflow: The recursive calls consume stack space leading to a stack overflow and crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The stack overflow crashes the JerryScript runtime, causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious JavaScript code: The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by executing crafted JavaScript code that constructs an object using a recursive function call.
- Specifically, the following JavaScript code triggers the vulnerability:
```javascript
function JSEtest() {
  new JSEtest();
}

try {
  JSEtest();
} catch (e) {
  print(e);
}
```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute JavaScript code within the JerryScript environment.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was identified by the OWL337 team.
- The fix involved adding stack-overflow checks for the `ecma_op_function_call_simple` and the general [[Construct]] method of function objects.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #4945.
