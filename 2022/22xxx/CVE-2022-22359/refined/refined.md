- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a parameter from a user request that allows a remote attacker to enable Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can perform actions on the system as a legitimate user, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification, data access, or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed remotely through crafted user requests exploiting the lack of CSRF protection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be remote and be able to send crafted requests to the system. The attacker needs to trick a legitimate user into interacting with the crafted request.
