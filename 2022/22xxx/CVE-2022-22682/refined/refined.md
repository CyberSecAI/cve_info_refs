- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated users can inject arbitrary web script or HTML. This could lead to various malicious actions such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks. The CVSS score indicates low impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Through unspecified vectors in the Event Management feature of Synology Calendar.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a remote, authenticated user on the Synology Calendar application. User interaction (UI:R) is required for the XSS payload to be triggered.
