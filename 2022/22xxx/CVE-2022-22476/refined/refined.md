- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a flaw in how IBM WebSphere Application Server Liberty handles identity verification when the `appSecurity-1.0`, `appSecurity-2.0`, `appSecurity-3.0`, or `appSecurity-4.0` features are enabled. This allows an attacker to potentially spoof user identities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Identity spoofing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially impersonate legitimate users, gaining unauthorized access to resources and functionalities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the application server itself, exploiting the way it handles identity within the appSecurity features.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The specific method of exploitation and required attacker capabilities are not explicitly detailed in the provided text beyond the general category of identity spoofing. However, the attacker must be able to interact with the WebSphere Application Server Liberty instance.
