### CVE-2022-22743
- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  When navigating from inside an iframe while requesting fullscreen access, the browser could fail to exit fullscreen mode. This is due to the window actor not being destroyed and becoming confused about the fullscreen state when BFCache is enabled for fission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The browser's fullscreen state management was unreliable when navigating from within an iframe that requested fullscreen access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could create a malicious page where, after a user interacts with an iframe to enter fullscreen, the browser gets stuck in fullscreen mode even after pressing ESC, requiring the user to close the window via OS taskbar or Task Manager. This could be used to spoof browser UI elements.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attack requires a user to visit a malicious webpage containing a specially crafted iframe.
    - The iframe requests fullscreen access, and then the parent page navigates to a page stored in the BFCache.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage that the victim will visit.
