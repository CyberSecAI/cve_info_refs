- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Specific BD Pyxisâ„¢ products are installed with default credentials, which may be shared across product types.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of default credentials for local operating systems or domain-joined servers, potentially granting unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could gain privileged access to the underlying file system, potentially leading to exploitation, access to ePHI (electronic protected health information), or other sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers need to gain access to the default credentials, infiltrate the facility's network, and access individual devices or servers. This could be done through adjacent network access, as specified in the CVSS score.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers need to have adjacent network access (meaning access to the same shared physical or logical network) to the vulnerable devices/servers and also have the default credentials.
