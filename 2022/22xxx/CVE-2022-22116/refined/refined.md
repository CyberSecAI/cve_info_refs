Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when handling SVG file uploads within the media upload functionality of the Directus application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, the application fails to neutralize user-controlled input (in this case, SVG files), allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which will be executed in a victim's browser when they access the image URL.
- This could lead to various malicious actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies or other sensitive data
    - Defacing the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the application's media upload functionality, specifically by uploading a crafted SVG file.
- A low privileged attacker can upload the malicious SVG file to the server.
- The XSS payload is then triggered when an administrator or other user views the uploaded SVG file (or its URL), resulting in execution of malicious JavaScript within their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low-privileged account on the Directus application.
- The attacker needs to have access to the media upload functionality.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SVG file containing the XSS payload.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Directus versions 9.0.0-alpha.4 through 9.4.1.
- The vulnerable component is in the media upload functionality.
- The vulnerability can be triggered on any user with access to the uploaded media.
- The fix is to update to Directus version 9.4.2 or later, where a Content Security Policy (CSP) has been added.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- Mend.io assigned a severity score of 5.4 to this vulnerability.
- CVSS v3.1 Base Score is 5.4
- CVSS v2 Base Score is 3.5
