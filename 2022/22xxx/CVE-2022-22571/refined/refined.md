Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2022-22571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw within the incapptic Connect web console. Specifically, a high-privilege user can inject a malicious payload that gets stored within the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the incapptic Connect web console. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
-   **Insufficient Privilege Separation:** While high privilege access is needed to inject the payload, any authenticated user who opens the file where the payload is stored becomes a victim.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful XSS attack can result in malicious script execution within the victim's browser session.
-   **Account Hijacking:** Exploitation could potentially lead to the theft of cookies and session tokens, enabling the attacker to hijack user accounts, including admin accounts.
-   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** Through XSS, attackers can steal sensitive information or manipulate data viewed by the victim.
-   **Further Attacks:** An XSS payload can be used to redirect users to phishing sites, initiate malware downloads, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Web Console:** The attack vector is the incapptic Connect web console where high privilege users can upload files containing the malicious payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **High Privilege Access:** The attacker needs a high privilege account to the incapptic Connect web console to inject the malicious payload.
-   **User Interaction (Indirect):** The attack requires that a victim opens a file that contains the XSS payload.
-   **Authenticated access:** The victim must be an authenticated user of the application

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects **all** versions of incapptic Connect.
-   There is no patch available, and the vendor has published a workaround instead.
