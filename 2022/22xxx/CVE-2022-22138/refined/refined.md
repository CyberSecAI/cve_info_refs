- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect computations for non-string inputs in the `fast-string-search` package.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS) caused by the package attempting to read from non-permitted memory locations when provided with non-string input, resulting in a segmentation fault.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the application using the vulnerable package, causing a denial of service and making the service unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing non-string inputs to the `indexOfSkip` function of the `fast-string-search` package.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker only needs to be able to control the inputs to the vulnerable function, and no special access or privileges are required. The attack can be triggered remotely over the network.
