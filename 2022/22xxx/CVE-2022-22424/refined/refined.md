- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to overly permissive file access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user could obtain sensitive information from the TLS key file.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the QRadar SIEM system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user account on the affected system.
