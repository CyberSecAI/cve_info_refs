Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2022-22749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The QR code scanner in Firefox for Android did not have sufficient restrictions on the URL schemes it would process. It allowed navigation to URLs beyond standard web content (http/https).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of URL scheme restrictions:** The QR code scanner allowed non-HTTP(S) URLs to be processed. Specifically, it was mentioned that `about:` URLs could be opened, which could lead to potentially dangerous actions by a malicious actor if the user was tricked into scanning a crafted QR code.
- **Lack of URL Normalization:** The confirmation message displayed to the user before opening the URL was not considered sufficient protection due to the lack of URL normalization

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Opening of privileged pages:** By using a QR code containing `about:` URLs, an attacker could potentially open privileged pages that are considered unsafe to be opened by websites due to potential vulnerabilities
- **User interface confusion:** Even if a malicious URL is blocked, the browser might still open a new tab which displays an empty/invalid page.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious QR codes:** An attacker could generate and distribute QR codes containing non-HTTP(S) URLs.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to trick the user into scanning the malicious QR code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to generate and distribute QR codes.
- The attacker needs to rely on the user scanning the malicious QR code with the vulnerable version of Firefox for Android.
