  "cveId": "CVE-2022-22747",
  "baseDescription": "After accepting an untrusted certificate, handling an empty pkcs7 sequence as part of the certificate data could have lead to a crash. This crash is believed to be unexploitable.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of an empty pkcs7 sequence within certificate data during the processing of an untrusted certificate.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The code doesn't handle the case of an empty pkcs7 sequence, leading to a null pointer dereference."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability leads to a crash due to a null pointer dereference when processing an empty pkcs7 sequence, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted certificate with an empty pkcs7 sequence. This crafted certificate is then processed by the vulnerable component resulting in the crash.",
         "The vulnerability is triggered during certificate processing, suggesting the attack vector involves sending malicious certificate data to the vulnerable application or service."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": [
         "The attacker would need to be able to provide a crafted certificate to the vulnerable application or service."
      ],
      "additionalDetails": "The crash occurs within the `CERT_DecodeCertPackage()` function. The issue was found in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. While a crash occurs, it's believed to be unexploitable for arbitrary code execution. The vulnerability affects both client and server applications using NSS to process certificates and that accept untrusted certificates. The fix involves adding a check for the missing `signedData` field."
