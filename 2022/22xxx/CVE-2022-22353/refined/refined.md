- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A software defect in IBM Big SQL prevents data masking rules from being enforced when a user executes a `CREATE TABLE AS (SELECT â€¦) WITH DATA` statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to enforce data masking rules during table creation using `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statement leading to exposure of unmasked data in the newly created table.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized exposure of sensitive data due to the creation of a new table that contains unmasked data, despite masking rules being in place.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the ability to execute SQL commands, specifically the `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statement, can bypass data masking rules and create tables containing unmasked data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to execute SQL `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` statements within IBM Big SQL.
