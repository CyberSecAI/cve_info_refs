- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A caching issue in the Function Catalog component of the Spring Cloud Function framework allows a user to cause a denial of service (DoS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper caching mechanism leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability. The caching mechanism within the Function Catalog component is not properly handling resource consumption or eviction, which allows an attacker to exhaust the resources, leading to a DoS condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service condition, making the affected application unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through direct interaction with the framework's lookup functionality, specifically via the spring-cloud-function-web module, which exposes the framework functionality to a user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to directly interact with the framework's provided lookup functionality which, at the time of writing, was only possible through the `spring-cloud-function-web` module.  No authentication is needed (PR:N).
