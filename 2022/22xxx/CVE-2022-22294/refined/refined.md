The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in Zfaka version 1.4.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header, before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application directly incorporates the value from the `X-Forwarded-For` header into a SQL query without sanitization or parameterization, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.
- **Stack Injection:** The vulnerability allows for multiple SQL queries to be executed in sequence (stack injection) due to the lack of proper escaping or use of prepared statements for dynamic SQL query construction.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, enabling them to modify or extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker was able to add a new administrator account by injecting an `INSERT` statement, leading to full control of the application's admin panel.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the `X-Forwarded-For` header, injecting malicious SQL code within it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate HTTP headers, specifically the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
- The attacker must also perform a valid request for the injection point to be reached. This involves CSRF token requirements but can be satisfied by first requesting a valid token, then manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header.
