Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-22664:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the MIDI processing component of Logic Pro and GarageBand.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read. This occurs when the application attempts to read data from a memory location outside the allocated buffer, which can lead to crashes or other unexpected behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Opening a maliciously crafted MIDI file can lead to:
  - Unexpected application termination (crash).
  - Arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing an attacker to run malicious code on the victim's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Opening a maliciously crafted file (specifically MIDI file).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious MIDI file and convince the user to open it with the vulnerable application (Logic Pro or GarageBand). This could involve sending the file via email, hosting it on a website, or other means of file sharing.

**Affected Software:**
- Logic Pro 10.7.3
- GarageBand 10.4.6
- macOS Big Sur 11.5 and later (for both Logic Pro and GarageBand)
- macOS Monterey (specifically the GarageBand MIDI component)

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was found by Brandon Perry of Atredis Partners.
- The vulnerability was addressed by improved bounds checking.
