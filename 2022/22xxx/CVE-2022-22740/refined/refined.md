Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2022-22740:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition. Certain network request objects, specifically `ChannelEventQueue::mOwner`, are freed too early when a network request handle is released.

**Vulnerability/Weakness:**
- Use-after-free: The program attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This occurs in the `CompleteResumeRunnable` constructor when accessing `mOwner`, which is a weak pointer that may already be dead.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitable Crash: The use-after-free can lead to a potentially exploitable crash. This can allow an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network requests: The vulnerability is related to how network requests are handled. It can be triggered by manipulating the timing of network request object releases.
- Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when a new tab is opened using `window.open()` while a previous request in the original tab is still processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger network requests.
- The attacker can exploit this by opening a new tab while the original tab is performing an XMLHttpRequest.
- The attacker would need some control over the page to trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue arises in `ChannelEventQueue.cpp`, specifically in the `CompleteResumeRunnable` constructor and `ResumeInternal()` function.
- The `mOwner` member of `ChannelEventQueue` is a weak pointer. When an `HttpChannelChild` object is released, `mOwner` is not nulled out, and it can be accessed after the memory is freed when the associated runnable is executed at a later time.
- The fix involves nulling out the `mOwner` pointer in `ChannelEventQueue` when the associated `HttpChannelChild` object is released.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided bugzilla link and associated comments provide a lot of extra detail regarding how the vulnerability was found and fixed.
- The vulnerability was found by bo13oy of Cyber Kunlun Lab.
- The bug was fixed in Firefox 96, Firefox ESR 91.5, and Thunderbird 91.5
- The fix was implemented by nulling out the `ChannelEventQueue::mOwner` when the object is released.
