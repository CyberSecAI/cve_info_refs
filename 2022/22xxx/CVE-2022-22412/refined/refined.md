- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficiently protected access tokens in IBM Robotic Process Automation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of access tokens due to inadequate protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Could allow unauthorized access to the system or resources, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities. The specific impact depends on the scope of access granted by the exposed tokens.
- **Attack vectors:**  Not specified, but likely involves an attacker gaining access to the insufficiently protected tokens through some means, potentially including network sniffing, system compromise, or social engineering.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to gain access to the inadequately protected access tokens. The specific means of acquiring those tokens is not defined.
