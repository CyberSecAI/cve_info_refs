- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The security bulletin does not specify the impact of the exploitation but XXE vulnerabilities can potentially lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, or server-side request forgery.
- **Attack vectors**: The bulletin does not specify the attack vectors but XXE vulnerabilities are typically exploited by injecting malicious XML payloads into the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The bulletin does not specify the attacker capabilities or position but an attacker would need to be able to send XML payloads to the vulnerable application.
