- **Root cause of vulnerability**: User credentials are stored in memory in plain text. Additionally, certain read operations on TCP/IP sockets can cause a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure, Denial of Service
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Information Disclosure: User credentials can be exposed.
    - Denial of Service: The backup-archive client can be rendered unavailable due to issues when reading from TCP/IP sockets.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly mentioned, but likely involves access to the system's memory or network interaction to trigger the read operations on TCP/IP sockets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need access to the system's memory to retrieve the credentials or be able to trigger the vulnerable socket read operations, indicating a position with some level of access to the system or network.
