2  Vulnerability overview

2.1  Type

CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input [7]

2.2  Management Summary

An authenticated attacker can send a manipulated packet to the PLC and configure an invalid node name to
block consecutive logins by node name over the CODESYS communication protocol.

2.3  References

CVE: CVE-2022-22508 [6]

CODESYS JIRA: CDS-81444, CDS-81451

2.4  Severity Rating

CODESYS GmbH has rated this vulnerability as medium.

The CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 has been assigned. The CVSS vector string is

3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

CODESYS products such as the CODESYS Control runtime systems contain communication servers for the
CODESYS protocol to enable communication with clients such as the CODESYS Development System. The
CODESYS Control runtime system also provides a network scan functionality to find PLCs and select them in
the CODESYS development system communication dialog to log on to the PLC. The network scan information
includes the node name of the PLC among other information. An authenticated attacker can send a manipulated
packet to the PLC that configures an invalid node name, or may configure it locally in the CODESYS Control
configuration file.

As a result, the PLC still appears in the network scan result, but with the invalid node name. For the CODESYS
communication protocol, however, such invalid names are not accepted when logging in by name.

Log in via the device address (example: “[056D]”) or via the IP address (example: “192.168.101.109”) of the

Advisory 2022-16

PLC is still possible. After successful authentication at a channel opened by these communication options, the
node name can be set to a valid/original name.

3.2  Exploitability

This vulnerability could be exploited remotely after successful authentication.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit this vulnerability.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability in CODESYS products.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released version V3.5.18.40, which solves the identified security vulnerabilities for the
following products:
• CODESYS Control RTE (SL)
• CODESYS Control RTE (for Beckhoff CX) SL
• CODESYS Control Win (SL)
• CODESYS HMI (SL)
• CODESYS Control Runtime System Toolkit

For the below listed products, CODESYS GmbH has released version V4.7.0.0 based on the CODESYS
Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit V3.5.18.40:
• CODESYS Control for BeagleBone SL
• CODESYS Control for emPC-A/iMX6 SL
• CODESYS Control for IOT2000 SL
• CODESYS Control for Linux SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC100 SL
• CODESYS Control for PFC200 SL
• CODESYS Control for PLCnext SL
• CODESYS Control for Raspberry Pi SL
• CODESYS Control for WAGO Touch Panels 600 SL

The CODESYS Development System and the products available as CODESYS AddOns can be downloaded
and installed directly with the CODESYS Installer or be downloaded from the CODESYS Store.

Alternatively, as well as for all other products, you will find further information on obtaining the software update
in the CODESYS Update area [3].

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerability.

In case the software update is not applied, CODESYS GmbH has not identified a specific workaround that
prevents a successfully authenticated user from renaming the PLC to an invalid node name through manually
created online requests or invalid configuration settings.

If the node name has been manipulated, it is always possible to log in using the device address (example:
“[056D]”) or the IP address (example: “192.168.101.109”). After successful authentication on a channel opened
by these communication options, the node name can be set back to a valid/original name.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
