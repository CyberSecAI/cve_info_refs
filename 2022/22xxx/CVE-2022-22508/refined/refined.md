Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of consistency within the input when setting the node name of a CODESYS PLC. Specifically, an authenticated attacker can send a manipulated packet to the PLC or modify the configuration file locally, causing the PLC to adopt an invalid node name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-1288: Improper Validation of Consistency within Input:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation on the input used to set the node name. The system accepts an invalid node name, leading to issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (Limited):** The primary impact is a denial of service, specifically the inability to log in to the PLC using the node name. While the PLC still appears in network scans, the invalid node name prevents login via the standard name-based method. Logins via IP address or device address remain functional.
*   **Disruption of Operations:** This can disrupt operations as it interferes with normal workflows reliant on logging in via the device name, making it more cumbersome to connect to devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Communication:** An attacker can send a specially crafted packet over the network to the PLC to set the invalid node name.
*   **Local Configuration:** An attacker with access to the PLC's configuration file can also set an invalid node name locally.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid authentication credentials to communicate with the PLC and send the manipulated packet.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the PLC if exploiting remotely.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to modify configuration files.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of specific CODESYS V3 products prior to V3.5.18.40 and products based on the CODESYS Control V3 Runtime System Toolkit prior to V4.7.0.0.
* The vulnerability is rated as medium severity, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 4.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
* The exploit is considered relatively easy for an attacker with low skills to execute once authenticated
* The vulnerability was reported by icsbob.
* While the node name can be manipulated, it is possible to log in using IP or device addresses and then reset the node name to a valid one.
