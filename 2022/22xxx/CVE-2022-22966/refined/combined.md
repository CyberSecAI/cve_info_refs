| VMware Cloud Director 10.3.3 | 14 APR 2022 | Build 19610875 (installed build 19610595)  Check for additions and updates to these release notes. |

## What's New

The VMware Cloud Director 10.3.3 release provides bug fixes, API enhancements, and enhancements of the VMware Cloud Director appliance management user interface:

* **Backup and restore of VMware Cloud Director appliance certificates**. VMware Cloud Director appliance management interface UI and API backup and restore now includes VMware Cloud Director certificates. See [Backup and Restore of VMware Cloud Director Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Install-Configure-Upgrade-Guide/GUID-9562FBC9-4537-4FE6-B1CC-005C232A556D.html) in the *VMware Cloud Director Installation, Configuration, and Upgrade Guide*.
* **SSO login now requires user interaction before redirecting to the identity provider (IdP).** When you navigate to an SSO enabled organization, you see a screen with the organization name and options to either log in with local credentials or to log in with SSO. Selecting the option to log in with SSO redirects you to the identity provider, similar to the behavior in earlier versions. With this feature, you can identify which organization you are signing in to before being redirected away from VMware Cloud Director.
* **New `/admin/user/{id}/action/takeOwnership` API to reassign the owner of media**.
* **Improved support for routed vApp network configuration** of the `MoveVApp` API.

This release resolves CVE-2022-22966. For information, see <https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories>.

## Resolved Issues

* **New -** **Creating an anti-affinity rule fails with an `InternalServerErrorException` error message**

  When you attempt to create an anti-affinity rule for a VM, placed on a storage policy having the `vSphere/IOPS` capability, the operation fails with an `InternalServerErrorException` error message.
* **Migrating a VM to a different resource pool fails with an `InternalServerErrorException` error message**

  When you attempt to migrate a VM to a different resource pool, if you configure a target datastore that is not shared with the source resource pool, the operation fails with an `InternalServerErrorException` error message.
* **Importing VMs to an elastic VMware Cloud Director organization VDC results in a `Cannot import VM since it is already managed by VMware Cloud Director` error message**

  In a multi-cluster environment, if you configure **Silver** storage profile for one of the clusters and **Gold** storage profile for another cluster, and in vCenter Server you create a VM on the **Silver** storage profile cluster, attempting to import this VM to an elastic organization VDC in VMware Cloud Director that is configured with both storage profiles by defininfg the VM storage profile as **Gold** fails with an error message.

  `Cannot import VM since it is already managed by VMware Cloud Director`
* **vApp deployment fails with an `ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "vapp_property_unique"` error message**

  When you attempt to deploy multiple vApps concurrently, the operation fails with an error message.

  `ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "vapp_property_unique"`

  This happens because the systems generates duplicate IDs for some of the vApps that are being simultaneously deployed.
* **Importing a VM from vCenter Server to VMware Cloud Director fails with a `vim.fault.CannotAccessNetwork` error message**

  In vCenter Server, if a VM is connected to a network that is not configured in VMware Cloud Director, importing this VM as a new vApp or to an existing vApp in VMware Cloud Director fails with a `vim.fault.CannotAccessNetwork` error message.
* When you enable FIPS mode, the vRealize Orchestrator integration fails with an error related to invalid parameters

  When you enable FIPS mode, the integration between VMware Cloud Director and vRealize Orchestrator does not work. The VMware Cloud Director UI returns an `Invalid VRO request params` error. The API calls return the following error:

  `Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 'param' arg cannot be null at org.bouncycastle.jcajce.provider.ProvJKS$JKSKeyStoreSpi.engineLoad(Unknown Source) at java.base/java.security.KeyStore.load(KeyStore.java:1513) at com.vmware.vim.install.impl.CertificateGetter.createKeyStore(CertificateGetter.java:128) at com.vmware.vim.install.impl.AdminServiceAccess. (AdminServiceAccess.java:157) at com.vmware.vim.install.impl.AdminServiceAccess.createDiscover(AdminServiceAccess.java:238) at com.vmware.vim.install.impl.RegistrationProviderImpl. (RegistrationProviderImpl.java:56) at com.vmware.vim.install.RegistrationProviderFactory.getRegistrationProvider(RegistrationProviderFactory.java:143) at com.vmware.vcloud.vro.client.connection.STSClient.getRegistrationProvider(STSClient.java:126) ... 136 more`
* **If you enable the non-blocking AMQP notifications, AMQP based API extensibility requests to VMware Cloud Director time out**

  After upgrading to VMware Cloud Director 10.3.2, AMQP API reply messages to VMware Cloud Director are not handled and time out if non-blocking AMQP notifications are enabled in VMware Cloud Director.
* **Creation of new VM fails with a `Unable to place the vApp in the VDC` error message**

  When you attempt to create a new VM or a vApp, the operation fails with a `Unable to place the vApp in the VDC` error message.
* **You cannot merge provider VDCs backed by NSX-T Data Center, nor provider VDCs with no NSX backing**

  When you merge two provider Virtual Data Centers (VDCs) that are backed by NSX-T Data Center or provider VDCs with no NSX backing, the following error occurs: `Cannot merge Provider VDCs. Found NSX-T backed Provider VDC.`
* **Modifying an existing distributed firewall rule configured with an auto-discovered virtual machine as the source results in an error message**

  When editing a distributed firewall rule that contains an auto-discovered VM as the source, the operation fails with an error message.

  `Distributed Firewall rule <firewall-name> has an invalid specification of value`
* **Creating new virtual machine with multiple storage disks fails with a `The requested operation will exceed the VDC's storage quota` error message**

  When creating a new standalone VM, if you configure multiple storage disks, the operation fails with an error message.

  `The requested operation will exceed the VDC's storage quota`
* **Add and edit operations for a distributed firewall rule fails with an error message**

  Adding a new distributed firewall rule to the scope of the organization VDC and editing an existing distributed firewall rule fails with an error message.

  `Precondition failed. Please update the current configuration with the latest generation Number.`
* **You cannot configure your browser to use your published proxies**

  When attempting to configure your browser to use your published proxies, copying the URL of the proxy auto-config (PAC) file into your browser fails with an error message.

  `"minorErrorCode" : "NOT_ACCEPTABLE"`

  As a result, you cannot open the endpoint of a dedicated vCenter Server instance with your VMware Cloud Director account.
* **The New VM wizard displays a `No enabled storage policies that support Virtual Machines` error message**

  When creating a new VM, the New VM wizard briefly displays a `No enabled storage policies that support Virtual Machines` error message that automatically dissappears.
* **Updating the VM storage policy and adding a disk to a VM results in a `The operation could not be performed because the object is in an invalid state` error message**

  When updating the VM storage policy or adding a new hard disc to a VM, the operation fails with an error message.

  `The operation could not be performed because the object is in an invalid state. - The operation is not allowed in the current state of the host.`

  This happens because the placement engine attempts to move the VM to a host that is in a maintenance mode.
* **Configuring the IP mode for a VM NIC to Static - Manual with IPv4 address results in an error message**

  For a new or existing VM, if you attempt to configure the IP mode to **Static - Manual** with an IPv4 address, the validation fails with an error message.

  `<IP-address> is not a valid IPv6 address.`
* **VMware Cloud Director applies the configured operation limits only to the system organization**

  VMware Cloud Director applies the general system settings related to operation limits only to the system organization instead system-wide.
* **You cannot access a virtual machine console**

  If you configure multiple VMware Cloud Director cells behind a load balancer and only some of the cells are in a healthy state, attempting to access a VM console by opening the virtual machine remote console or the Web console fails with an operation timeout error.
* **An attacker with access to a user account or JWT token can reset a user password without knowing the current password**

  An attacker with access to a user account or JWT token can change the user password without knowing the current one.
* **If you migrate a VM, vApp, or independent disk to a vCenter Server instance that uses well-signed certificates, the migration fails**

  When trying to migrate a VM, vApp, or independent disk from one vCenter Server instance to another that uses well-signed certificates, the migration fails. The problem occurs when using the VMware Cloud Director UI and API requests like recompose, migrateVms, moveVApp, and so on.

## Known Issues

* **New -** **VMware Cloud Director UI and tasks are slow to load and complete**

  The Artemis message bus communication is not working and when you trigger operations from the UI, they can take up to 5 minutes to complete or might time out. The performance issues can affect operations such as powering on VMs and vApps, provider VDC creation, vApp deployment, and so on.

  The log files might contain an error message, such as:

  + a) `Connection failure to <VCD Cell IP Address> has been detected: AMQ229014: Did not receive data from <something> within the 60,000ms`
  + b) `Connection failure to /<VCD Cell IP Address>:61616 has been detected: AMQ219014: Timed out after waiting 30,000 ms`
  + c) `Bridge is stopping, will not retry`
  + d) `Local Member is not set at on ClusterConnection ClusterConnectionImp`

  Workaround:

  For a) and b):

  1. Verify that the VMware Cloud Director cells have network connectivity and can communicate with each other.
  2. Restart the VMware Cloud Director cell that contains the error message.

  For c) and d), restart the VMware Cloud Director cell that contains the error message.
* **New -** **The VMware Cloud Director appliance database disk resize script might fail if the backing SCSI disk identifier changes**

  The database disk resize script runs successfully only if the backing database SCSI disk ID remains the same. If the ID changes for any reason, the script might appear to run successfully but fails. The `/opt/vmware/var/log/vcd/db_diskresize.log` shows that the script fails with a `No such file or directory` error.

  Workaround:

  1. Log in directly or by using an SSH client to the primary cell as **root**.
  2. Run the `lsblk --output NAME,FSTYPE,HCTL` command.
  3. In the output, find the disk containing the `database_vg-vpostgres` partition and make note of its ID. The ID is under the HCTL column and has the following sample format `2:0:3:0`.
  4. In the `db_diskresize.sh` script, modify the partition ID with the ID from Step 3. For example, if the ID is `2:0:3:0`, in line

     ```
     echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/2\:0\:2\:0/device/rescan
     ```

     you must change the ID to `2:0:3:0`.

     ```
     echo 1 > /sys/class/scsi_device/2\:0\:3\:0/device/rescan
     ```
  5. Аfter saving the changes, manually re-invoke the resize script or reboot the appliance.
* **New -** **Publishing a vRealize Orchestrator workflow to the VMware Cloud Director service library fails with an error message**

  When you attempt to publish a vRealize Orchestrator workflow, the operation fails with a `500 Server Error` error message.

  This happens because the API returns a large number of links for each individual tenant to which the workflow is published and causes an overflow in the HTTP headers.

  Workaround: To publish the workflow, use `CURL` or `POSTMAN` to run an API request with increased HTTP header size limit.
* **New -** **When you use the VMware Cloud Director UI to create a new VM with a placement policy, all virtual machines that are part of the VM group defined in the used placement policy might disappear**

  When you use the VMware Cloud Director UI to create a new VM that uses a certain placement policy, all virtual machines listed in the VM group that's defined in the used placement policy might disappear from the VM group.

  Workaround: When the VMs get deleted from the group, they become non-compliant with the placement policy that you used to create the new VM. To restore the VMs to the group, manually make each of them compliant with the used placement policy.
* **New -** **VMware Cloud Director operations, such as powering a VM on and off takes longer time to complete**

  VMware Cloud Director operations, such as powering a VM on or off takes longer time to complete. The task displays a `Starting virtual machine` status and nothing happens.

  The `jms-expired-messages.logs` log file displays an error.

  `RELIABLE:LargeServerMessage & expiration=`

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **NSX context profiles disappear after synchronization between VMware Cloud Director and NSX**

  If a large number of NSX context profiles are created for an edge gateway in VMware Cloud Director, sometimes the NSX context profiles don't sync correctly between VMware Cloud Director and NSX. As a result, some context profiles might get deleted. For information on NSX context profiles in VMware Cloud Director, see [Create Custom Application Port Profiles](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.4/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-32EC8B59-F042-4891-8A54-23315E565D78.html).
* **New -** **Attempting to create a new application port profile fails with a duplicate error message**

  If two organization VDCs that are part of the same organization are backed by different NSX Manager instances, attempting to create an application port profile with the same name on both edge gateways might fail with the error message `Application Port Profile already exists in Organization`.
* **New -** NSX context profiles disappear after synchronization between VMware Cloud Director and NSX

  If a large number of NSX context profiles are created for an edge gateway in VMware Cloud Director, sometimes the NSX context profiles don't sync correctly between VMware Cloud Director and NSX. As a result, some context profiles might get deleted. For information on NSX context profiles in VMware Cloud Director, see [Create Custom Application Port Profiles](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.4/VMware-Cloud-Director-Service-Provider-Admin-Portal-Guide/GUID-32EC8B59-F042-4891-8A54-23315E565D78.html).
* **New -** **A VM with IP mode set to DHCP might not be able to connect to an external network**

  If a VM with IP mode set to DHCP is connected to a vApp network that uses port forwarding, the VM cannot connect to an external network. This happens because in NSX-backed organization VDCs, enabling IP masquerading for a vApp network does not create a corresponding SNAT rule on the vApp edge in NSX to allow outbound access for a VM without a static IP.

  Workaround: Add to the vApp network a second vApp with a static IP and an explicit DNAT rule that allows access to the external network to the vApp network.
* **New -** **Migrating a VM that is connected to a vSphere-backed external network between resource pools fails**

  If a VM is connected to an external network which is backed by multiple vSphere networks, and you attempt to migrate the VM between resource pools, the operation fails if the source and destination resource pools are backed by different host clusters and if the destination resource pool does not have access to the external network to which the VM was originally connected.

  Workaround: None.
* **Guest OS customizations like hostname and network do not work for the AlmaLinux OS**

  If you deploy an AlmaLinux template, VMware Cloud Director ignores the hostname and network configurations even when you force the guest customizations.

  Workaround: Edit the `/etc/redhat-release` file to replace `AlmaLinux` with `CentOS Linux`.
* **New -** **Viewing the load balancer pools for an NSX edge gateway in the VMware Cloud Director UI might fail with a duplicate key error**

  Viewing the load balancer pools for an NSX edge gateways that uses NSX Advanced Load Balancing fails with `Duplicate key` error. This happens because of a failed automated creation of load balancing server pools with `pool_backing_id` set to `null` that are not used for any virtual services.

  Workaround: Manually remove the server pools with `pool_backing_id` set to `null` from the VMware Cloud Director database.
* **New -** **Active Directory users cannot use the cell management tool on the VMware Cloud Director appliance**

  Active Directory users cannot run the cell management tool on the VMware Cloud Director appliance. The `cell-management-tool.log` file contains the following exception.

  ```
  Unable to connect to the cell: Invalid credentials. Exiting. | java.lang.SecurityException: Invalid credentials at com.vmware.vcloud.common.jmx.VCloudJMXAuthenticator.authenticate
  ```

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **Running a custom workflow with external validation in vRO Workflow Execution UI plug-in fails with an `Error performing external validation` error message**

  When running a custom workflow with external validation through the vRO Workflow Execution UI plug-in, the process fails with an `Error performing external validation` error message. The issue occurs because vRealize Orchestrator does not perform validation on the inputs in the custom form in VMware Cloud Foundation.

  **Workaround:** None.
* **New -** **The VMware Cloud Director dashboards for flex organization VDCs show incorrect CPU use**

  For flex organization VDCs, if the **Make Allocation pool Org VDCs elastic** option is activated, the flex organization VDC dashboard displays incorrect information about the vCPU use. For example, in a flex organization VDC with default vCPU speed of 1 GHz where the sizing policy defines the vCPU speed to 2GHz, if you create a VM, the dashboard incorrectly shows the vCPU use as 1 GHz. In the flex allocation model, the VM compute resource allocation depends on the VM sizing policies, and the real vCPU speed is 2GHz. When the **Make Allocation pool Org VDCs elastic** option is deactivated, the metrics appear correctly.

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **You cannot create VMware Cloud Director VDC templates in VMware Cloud Director service environments**

  VMware Cloud Director service does not support Virtual Data Center (VDC) templates. You can use VDC templates on environments with provider VDCs with an NSX network provider type or an NSX Data Center for vSphere provider type. You cannot use VDC templates on VMware Cloud Director service environments because the provider VDCs have the VMC network provider type.

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **VMs become non-compliant after converting a reservation pool VDC into a flex organization VDC**

  In an organization VDC with a reservation pool allocation model, if some of the VMs have nonzero reservation for CPU and Memory, non-unlimited configuration for CPU and Memory, or both, after converting into a flex organization VDC, these VMs become non-compliant. If you attempt to make the VMs compliant again, the system applies an incorrect policy for the reservation and limit and sets the CPU and Memory reservations to zero and the limits to **Unlimited**.

  Workaround:

  1. A system administrator must create a VM sizing policy with the correct configuration.
  2. A system administrator must publish the new VM sizing policy to the converted flex organization VDC.
  3. The tenants can use the VMware Cloud Director API or the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal to assign the VM sizing policy to the existing virtual machines in the flex organization VDC.
* **New -** **Migrating VMs between organization VDCs might fail with an insufficient resource error**

  If VMware Cloud Director is running with vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3h or earlier, when relocating a VM to a different organization VDC, the VM migration might fail with an insufficient resource error even if the resources are available in the target organization VDC.

  Workaround: Upgrade vCenter Server to version 7.0 Update 3i or later.
* **New -** **Suspending a VM through the VMware Cloud Director UI results in a partially suspended state of the VM**

  In the VMware Cloud Director Tenant Portal, when you suspend a VM, VMware Cloud Director does not undeploy the VM, and the VM becomes `Partially Suspended` instead of `Suspended`.

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **Role name and description are localized in the VMware Cloud Director UI and can cause duplication of role names**

  The problem occurs because the UI translation does not affect the back end and API. You might create roles with the same names as the translated names which results in perceived duplicate roles in the UI and conflicts with the API usage of role names when creating service accounts.

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **The Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) status is `Enabled` even after deactivating it during the installation of VMware Cloud Director**

  During the installation of VMware Cloud Director, if you deactivate the option to join the CEIP, after the installation completes, the CEIP status is active.

  Workaround: Deactivate the CEIP by following the steps in the [Join or Leave the VMware Customer Experience Improvement Program](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Install-Configure-Upgrade-Guide/GUID-A0C0A082-31E6-4E61-A31B-5A47D2C74411.html) procedure.
* **New -** **When starting the VMware Cloud Director appliance, the message `[FAILED] Failed to start Wait for Network to be Configured. See 'systemctl status systemd-networkd-wait-online.service' for details` appears.**

  The message appears incorrectly and does not indicate an actual problem with the network. You can disregard the message and continue to use the VMware Cloud Director appliance as usual.

  Workaround: None.
* **New -** **After VMware Cloud Director upgrade from version 10.2.2.x, adding a new node to the cluster fails with a `file could not be found` error**

  Upgrading VMware Cloud Director changes the location of the `certificates.ks` file which causes adding new nodes to fail with the following error.

  ```
  Error: file could not be found: /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/user.http.pem
  Error: invalid input: No valid HTTP SSL certificate provided
  ```

  Workaround: Update the`/opt/vmware/appliance/bin/setupvcd.sh` script with the following commands.

  ```
  #$VCLOUD_HOME/bin/configure --unattended-installation --primary-ip $ip --console-proxy-ip $ip --console-proxy-port-https 8443 -r $responsefile$VCLOUD_HOME/bin/configure --unattended-installation --primary-ip $ip --console-proxy-ip $ip --console-proxy-port-https 8443 --cert /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc/user.http.pem --key /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc/user.http.key --consoleproxy-cert /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc/user.consoleproxy.pem --consoleproxy-key /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/etc/user.consoleproxy.key -r $responsefile
  ```
* **New -** **VMware Cloud Director appliance upgrade fails with an invalid version error when FIPS mode is enabled**

  For VMware Cloud Director versions 10.3.x and later, when FIPS mode is enabled, VMware Cloud Director appliance upgrade fails with the following error.

  `Failure: Installation failed abnormally (program aborted), the current version may be invalid.`

  Workaround:

  1. Before you upgrade the VMware Cloud Director appliance, deactivate FIPS Mode on the cells in the server group and the VMware Cloud Director appliance. See [Activate or Deactivate FIPS Mode on the VMware Cloud Director Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Install-Configure-Upgrade-Guide/GUID-87EB7121-3B8C-4B57-83F7-0C23533C8D6C.html).
  2. Verify that the `/etc/vmware/system_fips` file does not exist on any appliance.
  3. Upgrade the VMware Cloud Director appliance.
  4. Enable FIPS mode again.
* **New -** **When performing a database upgrade for VMware Cloud Director, the upgrade fails with `insert or update on table` error**

  The issue occurs due to stale information in tables associated with a foreign key constraint. Missing data in one of the tables causes a conflict with the foreign key constraint.

  See [VMware knowledge base article 88010](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88010).
* **New -** **You cannot login to the VMware Cloud Director portals by using Single Sign On**

  When customizing the VMware Cloud Director portals, if you change the default configuration for the `portalColor` parameter, you cannot login to the portals by using Single Sign On. On the login page of the tenant portal, when you click on **Sign In with Single Sign-On**, the system redirects you back to the login page.

  Workaround: Set the value for the `portalColor` parameter to `null`.
* **Refreshing the LDAP page in your browser does not take you back to the same page**

  In the Service Provider Admin Portal, refreshing the**LDAP** page in your browser takes you to the provider page instead of back to the LDAP page.

  Workaround: None.
* **Mounting an NFS datastore from NetApp storage array fails with an error message during the initial VMware Cloud Director appliance configuration**

  During the initial VMware Cloud Director appliance configuration, if you configure an NFS datastore from NetApp storage array, the operation fails with an error message.

  `Backend validation of NFS failed with: is owned by an unknown user`

  Workaround: Configure the VMware Cloud Director appliance by using the VMware Cloud Director Appliance API.
* **The synchronization of a subscribed catalog times out while synchronizing large vApp templates**

  If an external catalog contains large vApp templates, synchronizing the subscribed catalog with the external catalog times out.This happens when the timeout setting is set to its default value of five minutes.

  Workaround: Using the `manage-config` subcommand of the cell management tool, update the timeout configuration setting.

  `./cell-management-tool manage-config -n transfer.endpoint.socket.timeout -v [timeout-value]`
* **After upgrade to VMware Cloud Director 10.3.2a, opening the list of external networks results in a warning message**

  When trying to open the list of external networks, the VMware Cloud Director UI displays a warning message.

  `One or more external networks or T0 Gateways have been disconnected from its IP address data.`

  This happens because the external network gets disconnected from the Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) configuration before the upgrade to VMware Cloud Director 10.3.2a.

  Workaround: Contact VMware Global Support Services (GSS) for assistance with the workaround for this issue.
* **In an IP prefix list, configuring `any` as the Network value results in an error message**

  When creating an IP prefix list, if want to deny or accept any route and you configure the Network value as `any`, the dialog box displays an error message.

  `"any" is not a valid CIDR notation. A valid CIDR is a valid IP address followed by a slash and a number between 0 and 32 or 64, depending on the IP version.`

  Workaround: Leave the **Network** text box blank.
* **If you use vRealize Orchestrator 8.x, hidden input parameters in workflows are not populated automatically in the VMware Cloud Director UI**

  If you use vRealize Orchestrator 8.x, when you attempt to run a workflow through the VMware Cloud Director UI, hidden input parameters are not populated automatically in the VMware Cloud Director UI.

  Workaround:To access the values of the workflow input parameters, you must create a vRealize Orchestrator action that has the same input parameter values as the workflow that you want to run.

  1. Log in to the vRealize Orchestrator Client and navigate to **Library>Workflows**.
  2. Select the **Input Form** tab and click **Values** on the right-hand side.
  3. From the **Value options** drop-down menu, select **External source**,enter the **Action inputs** and click **Save.**
  4. Run the workflow in the VMware Cloud Director UI.
* **The vpostgres process in a standby appliance fails to start**

  The `vpostgres` process in a standby appliance fails to start and the PostgreSQL log shows an error similar to the following. `FATAL: hot standby is not possible because max_worker_processes = 8 is a lower setting than on the master server (its value was 16).`This happens because PostgreSQL requires standby nodes to have the same `max_worker_processes` setting as the primary node. VMware Cloud Director automatically configures the `max_worker_processes` setting based on the number of vCPUs assigned to each appliance VM. If the standby appliance has fewer vCPUs than the primary appliance, this results in an error.

  Workaround: Deploy the primary and standby appliances with the same number of vCPUs.
* **VMware Cloud Director API calls to retrieve vCenter Server information return a URL instead of a UUID**

  The issue occurs with vCenter Server instances that failed the initial registration with VMware Cloud Director version 10.2.1 and earlier. For those vCenter Server instances, when you make API calls to retrieve the vCenter Server information, the VMware Cloud Director API incorrectly returns a URL instead of the expected UUID.

  Workaround: Reconnect to the vCenter Server instance to VMware Cloud Director.
* **Upgrading from VMware Cloud Director 10.2.x to VMware Cloud Director 10.3 results in an `Connection to sfcbd lost` error message**

  If you upgrade from VMware Cloud Director 10.2.x to VMware Cloud Director 10.3, the upgrade operation reports an error message.

  `Connection to sfcbd lost. Attempting to reconnect`

  Workaround: You can ignore the error message and continue with the upgrade.
* **When using FIPS mode, trying to upload OpenSSL-generated PKCS8 files fails with an error**

  OpenSSL cannot generate FIPS-complaint private keys. When VMware Cloud Director is in FIPS mode and you try to upload PKCS8 files generated using OpenSSL, the upload fails with a `Bad request: org.bouncycastle.pkcs.PKCSException: unable to read encrypted data: ... not available: No such algorithm: ...`error or `salt must be at least 128 bits` error.

  Workaround: Deactivate the FIPS mode to upload the PKCS8 files.
* **Creation of Tanzu Kubernetes cluster by using the Kubernetes Container Clusters plug-in fails**

  When you create a Tanzu Kubernetes cluster by using the Kubernetes Container Clusters plug-in, you must select a Kubernetes version. Some of the versions in the drop-down menu are not compatible with the backing vSphere infrastructure. When you select an incompatible version, the cluster creation fails.

  Workaround: Delete the failed cluster record and retry with a compatible Tanzu Kubernetes version. For information on the incompatibilities between Tanzu Kubernetes and vSphere, see [Updating the vSphere with Tanzu Environment](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-E491159F-645F-4810-B9A0-8B19AF3E9219.html).
* **If you have any subscribed catalogs in your organization, when you upgrade VMware Cloud Director, the catalog synchronization fails**

  After upgrade, if you have subscribed catalogs in your organization, VMware Cloud Director does not trust the published endpoint certificates automatically. Without trusting the certificates, the content library fails to synchronize.

  Workaround: Manually trust the certificates for each catalog subscription. When you edit the catalog subscription settings, a trust on first use (TOFU) dialog prompts you to trust the remote catalog certificate.

  If you do not have the necessary rights to trust the certificate, contact your organization administrator.
* **After upgrading VMware Cloud Director and enabling the Tanzu Kubernetes cluster creation, no automatically generated policy is available and you cannot create or publish a policy**

  When you upgrade VMware Cloud Director to version 10.3.1 and vCenter Server to version 7.0.0d or later, and you create a provider VDC backed by a Supervisor Cluster, VMware Cloud Director displays a Kubernetes icon next to the VDC. However, there is no automatically generated Kubernetes policy in the new provider VDC. When you try to create or publish a Kubernetes policy to an organization VDC, no machine classes are available.

  Workaround: Manually trust the corresponding Kubernetes endpoint certificates. See VMware knowledge base article [83583](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83583).
* **Entering a Kubernetes cluster name with non-Latin characters deactivates the Next button in the Create New Cluster wizard**

  The Kubernetes Container Clusters plug-in supports only Latin characters. If you enter non-Latin characters, the following error appears.

  `Name must start with a letter and only contain alphanumeric or hyphen (-) characters. (Max 128 characters).`

  Workaround: None.
* **NFS downtime can cause VMware Cloud Director appliance cluster functionalities to malfunction**

  If the NFS is unavailable due to the NFS share being full, becoming read only, and so on, can cause appliance cluster functionalities to malfunction. HTML5 UI is unresponsive while the NFS is down or cannot be reached. Other functionalities that might be affected are the fencing out of a failed primary cell, switchover, promoting a standby cell, and so on. For more information about setting up correctly the NFS shared storage, see [Preparing the Transfer Server Storage for the VMware Cloud Director Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3/VMware-Cloud-Director-Install-Configure-Upgrade-Guide/GUID-BCC3CFF0-E85A-450C-8A5E-3723DFC1A093.html).

  Workaround:

  + Fix the NFS state so that it is not `read-only`.
  + Clean up the NFS share if it is full.
* **Trying to encrypt named disks in vCenter Server version 6.5 or earlier fails with an error**

  For vCenter Server instances version 6.5 or earlier, if you try to associate new or existing named disks with an encryption enabled policy, the operation fails with a `Named disk encryption is not supported in this version of vCenter Server`**.** error.

  Workaround: None.
* **A fast-provisioned virtual machine created on a VMware vSphere Storage APIs Array Integration (VAAI) enabled NFS array, or vSphere Virtual Volumes (VVols) cannot be consolidated**

  In-place consolidation of a fast provisioned virtual machine is not supported when a native snapshot is used. Native snapshots are always used by VAAI-enabled datastores, as well as by VVols. When a fast-provisioned virtual machine is deployed to one of these storage containers, that virtual machine cannot be consolidated .

  Workaround: Do not enable fast provisioning for an organization VDC that uses VAAI-enabled NFS or VVols. To consolidate a virtual machine with a snapshot on a VAAI or a VVol datastore, relocate the virtual machine to a different storage container.
* **If you add an IPv6 NIC to a VM and then you add an IPv4 NIC to the same VM, the IPv4 north-south traffic breaks**

  Using the HTML5 UI, if you add an IPv6 NIC first or configure an IPv6 NIC as the primary NIC in a VM, and then you add an IPv4 NIC to the same VM, the IPv4 north-south communication breaks.

  Workaround: First you must add the IPv4 NIC to the VM and then the IPv6 NIC.

#### Issue/Introduction

VMware Cloud Director 10.1.4.1, 10.2.2.3 and 10.3.3 address a remote code execution vulnerability. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ([https://cve.mitre.org](https://cve.mitre.org/)) has assigned the identifier CVE-2022-22966 to this issue.

**Note:** For customers on 9.7 and 10.0 versions, if you cannot upgrade, please use the workaround below.

VMware released VMware Security Advisory [VMSA-2022-0013](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0013.html) to help customers understand the issue and which upgrade path will fix it.

This article lists the recommended solution, upgrading to a patched release, but also provides a workaround for customers who can't upgrade.

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Director 9.x
VMware Cloud Director 10.x

#### Resolution

Permanent fixes have been released and are documented in VMware Security Advisory [VMSA-2022-0013](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0013.html) .
Customers are strongly recommended to upgrade to one of these applicable versions immediately.

| **VMware Cloud Director Version** | **Fixed Version** | **Release Date** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10.1.x | [10.1.4.1](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.1.4.1/rn/vmware-cloud-director-10141-release-notes/index.html) | April 14th 2022 |
| 10.2.x | [10.2.2.3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.2.2.3/rn/vmware-cloud-director-10223-release-notes/index.html) | April 14th 2022 |
| 10.3.x | [10.3.3](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Director/10.3.3/rn/vmware-cloud-director-1033-release-notes/index.html) | April 14th 2022 |

Workaround:
If upgrading to a recommended version is not an option, you may apply this workaround  for CVE-2022-22966 in 9.7, 10.0, 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3

**Note:**

* If you have upgraded to a **Fixed Version** of Cloud Director, the script is not applicable. Running the script will result in false negatives stating that patching is required.
* A new version of the script exists as of 20th May 2022 to address an additional issue specific to Console Proxy startup in versions 9.7.x and 10.0.x.
  + Both versions of the script fully protect against the security vulnerability.
  + If you have run the original script whilst on these releases, please re-run to apply the additional fixes.
  + If you are running versions other than 9.7.x and 10.0.x, there are no consequences to running the script again should you wish to validate.
    - For any validation, please ensure you also run the jConsole and jmxterm steps detailed below.
* The script contains a self-extracting JRE upgrade in instances where an older version of JRE is being used.
* Following the application of the workaround, any subsequent upgrade or patching of Cells to a build which is not a **Fixed Version** will revert the workaround.
  + Similarly, deploying Cells from a non-patched build will also result in the workaround not being applied. The script will need to be run on these newly deployed Cells.
  + In instances where a JRE rollback (detailed below) is required, you will also be in a position of not being fully patched. Please re-run the script to ensure your system is correctly patched.
* **There is no functionality impact as a result of implementing this workaround**

Perform the following steps:

1. SSH to any Cell within the Server Group.
2. Download the WA\_CVE-2022-22966.sh script to the /tmp directory.
3. Modify the permissions of the file to allow execution.
   1. *chown root:vcloud /tmp/WA\_CVE-2022-22966.sh*
   2. *chmod 740 /tmp/WA\_CVE-2022-22966.sh*
4. Navigate to the /tmp directory of the Cell.
   1. *cd /tmp*
5. Execute the script.
   1. .*/WA\_CVE-2022-22966.sh*                                                                                                                                                                                 ![image.png](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512265508714)
6. Ensure the services on the current Cloud Director Cell have restarted before proceeding with running the script on subsequent Cells.
   1. *tail -f  /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/logs/cell.log*
   2. You should see an entry like below when the Cell has completed startup. ![vcd_4.jpg](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512265402915)
7. To verify the patch has correctly been applied, you can check the existing config and also the runtime settings of the Cloud Director Cell
   1. To check the Config, run the following command
      1. *grep trustSerialData /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/bin/vmware-vcd-cell-common*
      2. You should expect to see the following output

![vcd_2.jpg](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512257723930)

2. To check the runtime settings, you can do so from any system that can connect to the Cells JMX port (8999) using either jConsole or jmxterm.
   1. To use jConsole, open the jConsole client and connect to the Cell
      1. Click on the MBeans tab in the top navigation bar
      2. Follow the navigation tree
         * java.lang
           + Runtime
             - Attributes
               * SystemProperties
      3. Double click javax.management.openmbean.TabularDataSupport
      4. Scroll until you find com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustSerialData
      5. The key, value pair must be present and the value must be false
   2. To use jmxterm, you will need to download it [here](https://docs.cyclopsgroup.org/jmxterm)
      1. Run the following command at the jmxterm command line, filling in the correct parameters
      2. echo "get --domain java.lang -b type=Runtime SystemProperties" | java -jar <path to jmxterm-1.0.2-uber.jar> -n -l <Cell FQDN>:8999 -u <administrator> -p '<administrator password>' | /bin/grep -A2 com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustSerialData
      3. Like with jConsole, you will get a key, value pair, and you should expect to see a false value.
3. Running the script again post the 1st execution will report that the cell is "Protected"

 ![image.png](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512269286658)

8. SSH to the remaining Cells serially and repeat steps 3-5 until all Cells in the Server Group are patched.

**JRE Rollback Steps**
As mentioned above, there will be instances where the installed version of JRE needs to be upgraded as part of the patching steps.
In instances where this needs to be applied, should there be issues, please follow the rollback steps below.

1. Move to the Cloud Director directory
   1. cd /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/
2. Remove the existing JRE directory and files
   1. rm -rf jre
3. Extract the pre-patch JRE directory and files
   1. tar xvfz /tmp/jre\_backup.tar.gz
4. Start the Cloud Director Service
   1. service vmware-vcd restart
5. Ensure the services on the current Cloud Director Cell have restarted before proceeding with running the script on subsequent Cells.
   1. tail -f  /opt/vmware/vcloud-director/logs/cell.log
   2. You should see an entry like below when the Cell has completed startup.

We were looking for a solution that supports our 24x7 online services deployed to our C-Level customers all over the globe. Our business cannot accept failure or loss of service, which means tracking our online and back-office systems is integral to our success. Wolken Enterprise is the only application that allows us to do this cost-effectively with comprehensive availability via the cloud.

We have seen a fivefold increase in the number of tickets submitted, thanks to the easy-to-use Wolken Service Desk solution. Our IT Support team has also benefited from our new system â they can resolve tickets at least 50% faster while keeping end users happy.

We were all amazed at how rapidly the Wolken Team solved problems, big or small, and went live in just weeks. New platforms can be pretty tricky, but Wolkenâs simple UI was straightforward to adapt to. We have seen a magnitude of difference in employee efficiency and resolution times. Wolkenâs easy configurability, scalability, and data integration have been the key to our customer experience success.

Wolken Enterprise, goes beyond technical bug tracking. It gives us a collaborative platform that brings the project managers, business analysts and developers on both sides on the same page. Project plans, documents, and service requests, including screenshots, can all be put into Wolken Enterprise, and progress and resolutions can be tracked and commented upon. It gives a feeling to our customers of being in control of their projects.
