- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Diagnostic records may contain values used to perform remote creation of SSH agents.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability due to the inclusion of sensitive data (values used for SSH agent creation) in diagnostic records.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user could potentially access sensitive information, specifically the values used to perform remote creation of SSH agents. This information could then be used to potentially gain unauthorized access to remote systems.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local access to the system where the vulnerable IBM UrbanCode Deploy instance is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local user with access to the diagnostic records of the IBM UrbanCode Deploy is required to exploit this vulnerability.
