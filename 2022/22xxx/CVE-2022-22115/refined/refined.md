Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the "Tag name" input field within the Teedy application. Specifically, the application does not neutralize or encode user-provided input when displaying it in the edit tag page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the "Tag name" field and stored persistently in the application's database. This code is then executed within the victim's browser when they view or edit the tag.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize or encode user-supplied input before rendering it on the page. This lack of validation allows the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Hijacking / Account Takeover:**  The injected scripts can extract the victim's session ID, since HttpOnly is set to “false” on the cookies. An attacker can use this information to take over the victim's account completely. This is particularly critical if the victim is an administrator as this could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser, leading to various malicious activities, such as data theft, redirection, or malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Attack Vector:** The attack can be initiated remotely over a network.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user to visit a page displaying the malicious Tag in edit mode, triggering the execution of the injected script.
- **Low Privileged Attacker:** A low-privileged attacker can create a malicious tag and exploit the XSS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to create tags.
-   The attacker needs the ability to inject malicious javascript code into the Tag Name field.
-   The attacker needs to lure a victim into viewing/editing the tag with the malicious payload in order to trigger the XSS.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in Teedy versions v1.5 through v1.9.
- The malicious payload is injected as the "Tag name" via the application's user interface
- The injected payload executes when a victim views/edits the tag, as the application fails to properly sanitize or encode the data.
- The "HttpOnly" flag is set to "false" on cookies, enabling session hijacking through JavaScript.
- The vulnerability can lead to an administrator account takeover.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version v1.10.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) code shows how a simple JavaScript payload can be injected and used to exfiltrate cookies.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 9.0, indicating a high severity.
- The CVSS v2 base score is 3.5, indicating a low severity.
