The provided document is a security advisory for CVE-2022-22518.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a software flaw in the CODESYS Control runtime system where deactivating previously enabled anonymous login in the security profile settings removes associated users and groups for only one component, instead of all registered components. This leaves anonymous access enabled for other components.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect User Management (CWE-286)
- Failure to properly disable anonymous access for all registered components when deactivated in the security profile settings.
- The system only removes anonymous users and groups for one component instead of all.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
If anonymous login is deactivated after prior activation, the associated services (e.g., OPC UA) can still be accessed remotely through anonymous login, potentially granting unintended access. This can lead to unauthorized access to information or control systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote access via network protocols such as OPC UA.
- Exploiting the existing (but intended to be deactivated) anonymous access configuration.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the affected CODESYS Control runtime system.
- Low level skills are sufficient to exploit this vulnerability, as they can reuse the still active services.
- No specific exploits are required since it is a configuration/management flaw.
