- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Advantech ADAM-3600 device uses a hardcoded private key, which is stored within the project folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to intercept traffic, gain unauthorized access to the web server, and perform further actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device. The attack has a low complexity, and no user interaction or privileges are required.
