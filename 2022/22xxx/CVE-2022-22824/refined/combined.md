SUMMARY

SINEMA Remote Connect Server is affected by multiple vulnerabilities, including

• A cross-site scripting vulnerability in an error message pop up window (CVE-2022-29034)
• Several authentication bypass, privilege escalation and integrity check vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-

32251 through -32261)

• A command injection vulnerability in the file upload service (CVE-2022-32262)
• A chosen-plaintext attack against HTTP over TLS ("BREACH”, CVE-2022-27221)
• Information disclosure vulnerabilities in the curl component (CVE-2021-22924 through -22925)
• Several vulnerabilities in the libexpat library, that could be exploited when the server is parsing
untrusted XML files (CVE-2021-45960, CVE-2021-46143, CVE-2022-22822 through -22827, CVE-
2022-23852, CVE-2022-23990, CVE-2022-25235 through -25236, CVE-2022-25313 through -
25315.

Siemens has released an update for the SINEMA Remote Connect Server and recommends to update to
the latest version. Note that the update also contains additional fixes for vulnerabilities documented in
Siemens Security Advisories SSA-244969, SSA-539476, SSA-685781 and SSA-712929.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple
management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed
machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the
Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect
Server.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if
one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
‘issuercert’ into account and it compared the involved paths case insensitively, which could lead to
libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all,
and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn’t include the ‘issuer cert’
which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using
a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
when parsing the string provided by the application.

# [R1] Nessus Versions 8.15.3 and 10.1.1 Fix Multiple Third-Party Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (Expat) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and an updated version has been made available by the provider.

Out of caution and in line with best practice, Tenable has opted to upgrade the Expat component to address the potential impact of the issue. Nessus 10.1.1 and Nessus 8.15.3 update Expat to version 2.4.4 to address the identified vulnerability.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus 10.1.1 and Nessus 8.15.3 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus).

There is a total of 8 CVEs fixed, all related to fixed-size integer math (integer overflow and invalid shifts) near memory allocation. Impact is denial of service, or more.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Debian Bug     : 1002994 1003474

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Expat, an XML parsing C
library, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code, if a malformed XML file is processed.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.6-2+deb10u2.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.10-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

For the detailed security status of expat please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat>
