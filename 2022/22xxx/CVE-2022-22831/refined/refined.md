      {
        "root_cause": "The application exposes a default value for the 'Authorization' HTTP header in the publicly accessible `app.js` file. This header, intended for authorization checks, is set to 'ms_user', which bypasses authentication checks.",

          "Authentication bypass",
          "Exposed default credentials/authorization token",
           "Lack of proper authorization checks"

        "impact": "An attacker can make unauthenticated requests to authorized areas of the application, including accessing MQTT connection information and adding new administrator users.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending crafted HTTP requests with the default 'Authorization' header",
          "Accessing publicly available JavaScript file (`app.js`) to obtain the default header value"
