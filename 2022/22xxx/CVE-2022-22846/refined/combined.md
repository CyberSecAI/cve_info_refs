| Hi,  dnslib client does not validate DNS transaction id (TXID) as specified in the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035#section-4.1.1). This considered as implementation bug. Attackers can use this to redirect users to their malicious name servers. I know the client created for testing but other projects using dnslib as a dependency might be affected as well.  I suggest to add a simple validate:  ``` #... request code a_pkt = q.send(address,port,tcp=args.tcp) a = DNSRecord.parse(a_pkt)  if q.header.id != a.header.id:     raise DNSError('Response transaction id does not match query transaction id') ``` |

| Thanks - as you note client.py is for testing but should clearly check TXIDs. I've also added a note in the README to ensure that TXID is validated. I've updated and released a new version on PyPi.  The CVE seems a bit ridiculous - sounds like someone just generating random CVEs to look good on a resume (it isn't actually accurate as it is not a library function - dnslib just parses the packets) |
