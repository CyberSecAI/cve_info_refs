- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read in `otool`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Opening a maliciously crafted file may lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a maliciously crafted file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file that would be opened by the vulnerable `otool` application.
