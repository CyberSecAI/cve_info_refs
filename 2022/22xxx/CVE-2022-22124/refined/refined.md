Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22124:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `www.mend.io_f85dfbb9_20250115_211418.html`, `www.whitesourcesoftware.com_0b4aca65_20250115_211415.html` and `www.mend.io_999a0047_20250115_211419.html` directly references CVE-2022-22124 and provides details about the vulnerability. The github issue also confirms the vulnerability. Therefore, the content is **RELEVANT**.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of uploaded SVG files, specifically in the profile image upload functionality within the Halo application. The application does not neutralize or remove the ability for script execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Malicious JavaScript code can be embedded within an SVG file and stored on the server. When a user views this stored SVG (for example, in their profile), the script executes in their browser, leading to an XSS attack.
    *   **Improper Input Neutralization**: The application fails to neutralize or sanitize the SVG file content before storing it. It doesn't remove or encode any scripts or HTML that is included within the SVG.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
    *   This can lead to various malicious activities, including: session hijacking, cookie stealing, and redirection to malicious websites.
    *   The stored nature of the XSS means that the attack can persist and affect multiple users, increasing the severity.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Upload Functionality**: The primary attack vector is through the profile image upload feature in the Halo application.
    *   **Malicious SVG file**: Attackers upload a specially crafted SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Authenticated User**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Halo application.
    *   **Access to Profile Settings**: The attacker must have access to the profile settings page where the profile picture can be changed.
    *   **Upload SVG**: The attacker needs the ability to upload files, specifically SVG files.

**3. Additional Information:**
   * The vulnerability is present in Halo versions v1.0.0 through v1.4.17 (the latest at the time of discovery).
   * A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is given to show an example of a malicious SVG file, that includes a simple javascript alert box.
   * There is no fix provided for the vulnerability.

**4. Technical Details**:
    *  The mend.io vulnerability description provides a snippet of the malicious SVG code used to exploit this vulnerability.
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
    <!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">
    <svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
       <rect width="500" height="500" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
       <script type="text/javascript">
          alert("POC");
       </script>
    </svg>
   ```
    *  The github source code provides the following information regarding the method of file upload. 
       ```java
        package run.halo.app.handler.file;
        import static run.halo.app.model.support.HaloConst.FILE_SEPARATOR;
        import java.awt.image.BufferedImage;
        import java.io.IOException;
        import java.io.InputStream;
        import java.util.function.Supplier;
        import javax.imageio.ImageReader;
        import org.apache.commons.lang3.StringUtils;
        import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
        import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
        import org.springframework.lang.NonNull;
        import org.springframework.lang.Nullable;
        import org.springframework.util.Assert;
        import org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;
        import run.halo.app.exception.FileOperationException;
        import run.halo.app.model.enums.AttachmentType;
        import run.halo.app.model.support.UploadResult;
        import run.halo.app.utils.ImageUtils;
       ```
       This shows that the file upload method is through `org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile` and does not contain any sanitization methods.

**5. CVSS Scores**
    *  **CVSS v3.1**: Base Score: 5.4 (Attack Vector: Network, Attack Complexity: Low, Privileges Required: Low, User Interaction: Required, Scope: Changed, Confidentiality: Low, Integrity: Low, Availability: None)
    *  **CVSS v2**: Base Score: 3.5 (Access Vector: Network, Access Complexity: Medium, Authentication: Single, Confidentiality: None, Integrity: Partial, Availability: None)

In summary, CVE-2022-22124 is a stored XSS vulnerability in Halo that arises due to a lack of input sanitization in the profile image upload functionality, enabling authenticated attackers to execute malicious JavaScript in other users' browsers by uploading a crafted SVG file.
