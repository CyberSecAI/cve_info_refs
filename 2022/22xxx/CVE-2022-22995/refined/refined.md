{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The create_appledesktop_folder function in Netatalk, when configured to use the legacy AppleDouble v2 format, unsafely moves files using the 'mv' system utility, allowing symlink redirection outside the shared volume.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of symlinks",
      "Insecure use of system utilities"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create arbitrary symbolic links and move them outside the shared volume. Subsequently, by reusing these symlinks, the attacker can write arbitrary files on the targeted system. On some devices, this can lead to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Abuse of Netatalk's create_appledesktop_folder function through symlink manipulation.",
      "Combination of AFP with other file sharing protocols (e.g., SMB) to create and move the symlink."
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to interact with the AFP service",
      "Ability to write to a shared volume via a separate file sharing protocol (like SMB)",
       "Ability to control the contents of files and their names."
