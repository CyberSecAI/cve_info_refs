Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22761:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `frame-ancestors` Content Security Policy (CSP) directive was not being enforced for web-accessible extension pages (pages with `moz-extension://` scheme). This was because the implementation was only checking HTTP channels.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Failure to enforce the `frame-ancestors` CSP directive on `moz-extension://` scheme pages.
- Lack of support for ExtensionProtocolHandler channels in frame-ancestor checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Clickjacking: Web content could frame web-accessible extension pages, potentially leading to malicious actions if the user interacts with the framed content without realizing it's an extension page.
- Bypassing the intended security protections provided by the `frame-ancestors` CSP.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious web pages: An attacker could create a webpage that embeds a vulnerable web-accessible extension page within an iframe.
- User interaction: Users would be tricked into interacting with the framed extension page, potentially leading to unintended actions within the context of the extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
- The attacker needs to know the URI of a vulnerable web-accessible extension page.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `nsContentSecurityUtils.cpp` file, where frame-ancestor checks were limited to HTTP channels.
- The fix involves adding support for channels from `ExtensionProtocolHandler`.
- The issue is specific to web extensions and requires extension-specific knowledge to resolve.
- The bug was reported by Mart Gil Robles (Mart at FlowCrypt), whose extension was affected.
- The fix was implemented and landed in Firefox 97 and ESR 91.6
