Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2022-22868:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Gibbon CMS v22.0.01

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Data theft
    - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the "name" parameter in Gibbon CMS. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into this parameter, which is then stored by the application. When a user views the stored data (where the name parameter is displayed), the malicious script is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject the malicious code via the vulnerable parameter. This likely requires some level of authenticated access to the Gibbon CMS to inject data.

**Additional Details**
- The issue was initially reported on the GibbonEdu/core repository, where a user named "truonghuuphuc" identified the stored XSS vulnerability. The vulnerable code was removed by a maintainer to protect users while a patch was developed.
- A github repository owned by truonghuuphuc lists this CVE and the description, "Gibbon CMS v22.0.01 Stored XSS via name parameters."

The provided content gives more details than the CVE description, by confirming that the vulnerability is a stored XSS, the affected version of Gibbon CMS is v22.0.01, and it specifically occurs via the "name" parameters.
