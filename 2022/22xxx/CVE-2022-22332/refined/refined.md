- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a weakness in the JWT token used as an authentication mechanism in the APIs of IBM Sterling Partner Engagement Manager.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core weakness is an insecure implementation of JWT token handling which allows for an impersonation attack.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access and potentially control over the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the APIs that use the vulnerable JWT token authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the APIs to exploit the JWT token vulnerability, suggesting a network-accessible position.
