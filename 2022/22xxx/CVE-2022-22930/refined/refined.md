Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)

**Root Cause:** The MCMS application uses the Freemarker template engine, and the template management functionality allows users to modify template files. Input to the template engine is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Unsanitized User Input:** The application does not sanitize user-provided input before passing it to the Freemarker template engine.
*   **Direct Template Modification:** The application allows users to directly modify template files, which can be a dangerous feature when combined with unsanitized template engine input.
*   **Use of Freemarker Template Engine:** While not inherently a weakness, the Freemarker engine, when used improperly, can be a source of SSTI vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious Freemarker code, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server. The provided example demonstrates execution of `calc` to show the impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Template Management Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered through the template management interface in the MCMS backend. An attacker would need to have access to the administrative panel to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Malicious Template Injection:** An attacker can inject a malicious Freemarker payload within the template file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to MCMS Backend:** An attacker needs to have access to the MCMS backend to use the template management functionality. This likely requires administrative or elevated privileges.

**Technical Details:**
The attacker injects the following Freemarker payload into a template:
```
${"freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()("calc")}
```
This payload leverages Freemarker's `freemarker.template.utility.Execute` class to execute the system command `calc`.
When the template is rendered, the injected code is executed on the server, leading to remote code execution.

This vulnerability is more detailed than the typical CVE description placeholder as it includes specific code and steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
