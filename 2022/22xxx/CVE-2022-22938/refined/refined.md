- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a denial-of-service issue due to a flaw in the TrueType font parser within the Cortado ThinPrint component.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition in the Thinprint service running on the host machine.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious actor with access to a virtual machine or remote desktop can exploit this issue.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to a virtual machine or remote desktop where VMware Workstation or Horizon Client for Windows is installed.
