- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, which allows for reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL or request that injects malicious script into the application. The injected script is then reflected back to the user's browser, where it executes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs or requests and trick the victim into accessing them. This can involve social engineering or other methods of URL manipulation.
