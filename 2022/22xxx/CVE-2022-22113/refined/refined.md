  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application does not properly terminate the session when a password has been changed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613)"
    ],
    "impact": "An already logged-in user can still access the application even after their password has been changed, potentially leading to unauthorized access and actions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have an active session before the password change. They also need to trigger the password change using a privileged account."
  },
  "affected_product": {
    "name": "DayByDay CRM",
    "versions": [
      "2.2.0",
      "2.2.1"
    ]
  },
  "remediation": "The current session should be destroyed whenever a user requests for a password change.",
   "additional_information": "The application is built on the Laravel framework and lacks session validation for active sessions after a password change. The proof of concept demonstrates how a low-privileged user can continue to use the application after their password has been changed by an administrator."
