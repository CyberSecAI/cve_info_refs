The provided content describes two denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities in Internet Anywhere Mail Server Ver.3.1.3.

**1. RETR DoS in POP service:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability lies in the POP service's handling of the `RETR` command. Specifically, it does not properly validate the input passed to the `atoi()` function when processing the message number.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The server fails to check the return value of `atoi()`. If a large, invalid number is provided, `atoi()` might return an unexpected value leading to a crash.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Sending a malformed `RETR` command with a large, invalid message number will cause the server to crash, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this by connecting to the POP service and sending the malformed RETR command.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to the POP service (typically port 110) and send commands. The attacker does not need any special privileges or credentials other than valid user credentials.

**2. Multiple connections to port 25 DoS:**

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability is due to the server's inability to handle a large number of connection requests to port 25 (SMTP).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The server's resource handling (likely memory or connection state tracking) is insufficient to deal with a large influx of connections. This leads to connection refusals and ultimately a complete inability to connect.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** By sending a high number of connection requests to the server's SMTP service, an attacker can cause the server to become unresponsive, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack vectors:**  A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by initiating a large number of connection attempts to port 25 (SMTP).
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to establish connections to port 25 on the mail server. No special privileges are required.

This content provides more specific details regarding the vulnerabilities than a generic CVE description, including the specific commands and the usage of the `atoi()` function.
