# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-010 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Site Wizard Input Validation" Vulnerability

Published: February 18, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** February 18, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in web applications associated with MicrosoftÂ® Site Server 3.0, Commerce Edition. These applications are provided as samples and generated by wizards, but do not follow security best practices. If deployed on a web site, they could allow inappropriate access to a database on the site. Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-010.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-010)

### General Information

## Issue

Two sample web sites provided as part of Site Server 3.0, Commerce Edition do not follow security best practices; the code generated by one of the wizards is affected by the same problem. The code requests an identification number as one of the inputs, but does not validate it before using it in a database query. As a result, a malicious user could, instead of entering an appropriate input, provide SQL commands. If this were done, the SQL commands would be executed as part of the query, and could be used to create, modify, delete or read data in the database.

The vulnerability only affects sites that have either deployed the code at issue here, or have used the code as a model for developing custom code. Customers who have deployed the code should apply the patch to ensure that security best practices are followed. Customers who have used the code as a guide in developing their own should refer to the Knowledge Base article referenced below for specific code changes.
