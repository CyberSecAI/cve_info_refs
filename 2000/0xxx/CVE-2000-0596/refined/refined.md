Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2000-0596:

**Vulnerability:** IE Script Vulnerability

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way Internet Explorer handles the `<OBJECT>` tag when referencing a Microsoft Access database (.mdb file) in a web page. Despite Access files being marked as unsafe for scripting by default, a specific script tag can be used to bypass this and execute VBA macro code within the Access file.

**Weaknesses:**
*   Internet Explorer's improper handling of the `<OBJECT>` tag allowed execution of VBA code in a referenced Access database, even when scripting was disabled.
*   The vulnerability allowed bypassing of safety mechanisms intended to prevent execution of unsafe content from external sources

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor could host a specially crafted Access file on a website.
*   When a user visits the malicious website, the web page's script code could reference this Access file.
*   Upon opening the referenced Access file, malicious macro or VBA code could execute on the user's computer.
*   This could lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Malicious website: The attacker hosts a web page with malicious script and a malicious Access file.
*   Email: A malicious user can include a link to a webpage containing the malicious code in an HTML email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to host web content accessible to the victim.
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious Access database with VBA code and a script to reference it.
*   The victim needs to be using a vulnerable version of Internet Explorer (4.01 SP2 or higher) with either Access 97 or Access 2000 installed.

The provided document also clarifies that the IE Script vulnerability is separate from the "Office HTML Script" vulnerability (CVE-2000-0597), although both could result in arbitrary code execution. It also highlights the fact that a patch was released to eliminate the vulnerability by removing the `<OBJECT>` tag vulnerability.
