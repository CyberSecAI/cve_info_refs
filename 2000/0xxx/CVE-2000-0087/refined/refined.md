The provided content describes vulnerabilities in Netscape Mail Notification (nsnotify.exe) which are relevant to CVE-2000-0087, as it discusses an issue with the storage of email passwords and usage of SSL.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Netscape Mail Notification utility (nsnotify.exe) does not respect the user's password saving and SSL connection preferences set in Netscape Messenger.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Unintended Password Storage:** nsnotify.exe stores the email server password regardless of whether the user has configured Netscape Messenger to remember it.
2. **Ignoring SSL Settings:** When using IMAP, nsnotify.exe always uses a non-SSL connection even if the user has configured Netscape Messenger to use IMAP over SSL (port 993).

**Impact of exploitation:**
1. **Password Exposure:** Due to the unintended storage of the password by nsnotify.exe, the password could be recovered by an attacker with local access to the system.
2.  **Credentials Sniffing:**  Because nsnotify.exe ignores the IMAP over SSL setting, the email server username and password will be sent in cleartext across the network whenever nsnotify.exe checks for new email, allowing an attacker who can sniff network traffic to capture those credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Local Access:**  An attacker with local access to the system could potentially retrieve the stored password from nsnotify.exe.
2.  **Network Sniffing:** An attacker who can monitor network traffic could sniff the credentials being sent in clear text when nsnotify.exe connects to the mail server, even if the user intended to use a secure connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. **Local access** to a machine that is running Netscape Mail Notification.
2. **Network access** to sniff network traffic.
