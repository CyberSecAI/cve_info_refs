- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CyberOffice Shopping Cart v2 application uses a hidden form field named "Price" to store the unit price of items. This value is submitted as part of the order form, allowing an attacker to modify this value locally by saving a copy of the form and changing the price before submission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application relies on client-side data (hidden form fields) for price information and does not perform adequate server-side validation. The application also uses referrer checking which can easily be bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can modify the unit price of items to zero or even a negative value, resulting in financial loss for the merchant.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is performed by saving a copy of the order form locally, modifying the hidden "Price" field, and then submitting the modified form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the order form and have the ability to save and modify its contents before submitting it to the server.
