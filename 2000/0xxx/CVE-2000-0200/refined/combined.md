## Patch Available for "Clip Art Buffer Overrun" Vulnerability

Published: March 06, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** March 06, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the MicrosoftÂ® Clip Art Gallery. The vulnerability could allow a malicious party to cause hostile code to execute on the computer of a user of the Clip Art Gallery.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-015.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-015)

### General Information

## Issue

The Microsoft Clip Art Gallery software is used to allow users to retrieve and use clip art in their documents. One of the features of the Clip Art Gallery allows the user to download additional clips from the Microsoft Clip Gallery Live web site, and then install that clip art on their computer. To do this, Clip Art Gallery and Clip Gallery Live use a file format called the CIL format to contain the newly downloaded clips. Under certain circumstances, a very long field embedded in a clip art CIL file could cause a buffer overrun in the Clip Art Gallery software. The buffer overrun could cause the software to crash or, under certain circumstances, could cause the execution of hostile code on the computer where the Clip Art Gallery software was executing.

The risk from this vulnerability results from the facts that any web site can host a CIL file and that clip art will normally be processed without prompting the user for confirmation as would be the case with an executable file format.

**Affected Software Versions**
The Clip Art Gallery software ships with the following products:

* Microsoft Office 2000
* Microsoft Works 2000
* Microsoft PictureIt 2000
* Microsoft Home Publishing 2000
* Microsoft Publisher99
* Microsoft PhotoDraw 2000 Version 1
* Microsoft Greetings 2000
