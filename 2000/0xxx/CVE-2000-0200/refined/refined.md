- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overrun vulnerability exists within the Microsoft Clip Art Gallery software due to a very long field embedded in a clip art CIL file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to software crashes or the execution of hostile code on the user's computer.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious CIL file hosted on any web site can be used to trigger the vulnerability when processed by the Clip Art Gallery.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious CIL file and host it on a web site, and then induce a user to download and open this file via the Clip Art Gallery.
