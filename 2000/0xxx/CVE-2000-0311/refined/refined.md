- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from how Active Directory handles access control for directory objects on a per-attribute basis. A malicious user can modify attributes they should not have permission to modify if they combine this action with operations on attributes they *do* have permission to modify.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is an inconsistency in access control enforcement within Active Directory, allowing unauthorized attribute modification under specific combined operation scenarios. This is described as a "Mixed Object Access" vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could change information in the Active Directory that they should not have the rights to modify.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a specific combination of operations that includes modifying an attribute a user *is* allowed to change with an attribute they are *not* allowed to change.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with some permissions to modify at least one attribute of a target class object in the Active Directory. The attacker does *not* need any special privileges beyond this limited permission.
