# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-026 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Mixed Object Access" Vulnerability

Published: April 20, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** April 20, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 2000 that could, under very specific conditions, allow a malicious user to change information in the Active Directory that he should not be able to change.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-026.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-026)

### General Information

## Issue

Active Directory allows for access control of directory objects on a per-attribute basis. However, the vulnerability at issue here could allow a malicious user to modify object attributes that he does not have permission to modify, as long as he combined the operation in a particular way with ones involving attributes that he **does** have permission to modify.

The vulnerability does not afford the malicious user an opportunity to modify all objects in a class - only the specific class objects for which he has permission to modify at least one attribute. Further, the vulnerability provides no capability to bypass normal authentication or Windows 2000 auditing, so administrators could determine if this vulnerability were being exploited, and by whom.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Windows 2000 Server
* Windows 2000 Advanced Server

  **Note** The vulnerability only affects the above products when they are used as domain controllers.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0311](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0311)
