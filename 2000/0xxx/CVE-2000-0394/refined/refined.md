The provided content describes a vulnerability in Axent NetProwler IDS version 3.0. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from NetProwler's inability to properly handle fragmented IP packets when profiling the FTP service. Specifically, a specially crafted sequence of two fragmented IP packets causes the NetProwler IDS to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of fragmented IP packets: The IDS fails to correctly reassemble or process fragmented packets, leading to a crash. This indicates a vulnerability in the packet processing logic.
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to disrupt the normal operation of the NetProwler IDS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) on the NetProwler IDS. When the vulnerability is exploited, NetProwler crashes, becoming unable to perform its monitoring and security functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. An attacker can send the specially crafted fragmented IP packets to a system protected by NetProwler.
- The attack targets the NetProwler IDS, specifically when it is profiling the FTP service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send IP packets to the target network where NetProwler is running.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the IP address being profiled by NetProwler and the ability to craft fragmented IP packets using tools like `libnet`.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication.
- The attacker needs to know that the NetProwler is profiling FTP traffic.

**Additional details:**
- The exploit code, `RFProwl.c`, is provided, which highlights the simplicity of the attack using `libnet`.
- The provided code sends two crafted IP packets.
- The vulnerability was tested against version 3.0 of NetProwler.
- The author mentions NetProwler stores alert information in a Jet .mdb, potentially linking this vulnerability to CVE-2000-0393.
