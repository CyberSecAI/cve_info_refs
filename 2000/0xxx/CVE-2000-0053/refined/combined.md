# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-001 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Malformed IMAP Request" Vulnerability

Published: January 04, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** January 04, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in the MicrosoftÂ® Commercial Internet System (MCIS) Mail server. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to remotely cause services on the server to fail, or cause arbitrary code to run on the server.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-001.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-001).

### General Information

## Issue

The IMAP service included in MCIS Mail has an unchecked buffer. If a malformed request containing random data were passed to the service, it could cause the web publishing, IMAP, SMTP, LDAP and other services to crash. If the malformed request contained specially crafted data, it could also be used to run arbitrary code on the server via a classic [buffer overrun](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/glossary) attack.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Commercial Internet System 2.0 and 2.5.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0053](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0053)
