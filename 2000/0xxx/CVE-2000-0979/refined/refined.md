- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the way the File and Print Sharing service implements password protection for a directory when that directory is shared over a network using share level access. This flaw allows a malicious program to gain access to the share without knowing the complete password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the implementation of share-level password protection in Windows 9x/Me's File and Print Sharing service. It allows a specially crafted client utility to bypass the need for the full share password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can retrieve, modify, or delete any file within the compromised share without knowing the full password.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a malicious client utility that exploits the flaw in the share-level password mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to run a specially crafted client utility on the network to target a vulnerable Windows 9x/Me system with file sharing enabled using share-level access controls.
