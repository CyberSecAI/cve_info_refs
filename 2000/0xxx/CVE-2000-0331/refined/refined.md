- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists within the CMD.EXE command processor for Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 in the code that handles environment strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow due to improper handling of environment strings.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious user can cause a denial-of-service condition by overflowing the buffer and causing the process to fail. The memory allocated to the process is not released until the operator clears an error dialog. By repeatedly triggering this, the attacker can make server memory unavailable, slowing or stopping its response time.
- **Attack vectors:**  Providing arguments to batch files or other scripts that create extremely large environment strings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide input to batch files or scripts on the affected server. Web servers offering batch files for remote use are particularly vulnerable.
