Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2000-0404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of ability to configure a browser to ignore "ResetBrowser" frames within the CIFS Computer Browser protocol implementation in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted ResetBrowser Frame Processing:** The primary vulnerability is that a machine acting as a browser (Master or Backup) cannot be configured to ignore ResetBrowser frames. This allows any machine on the subnet to send these frames and potentially disrupt the browser service.
*   **Unauthenticated Browser Protocol:** The Computer Browser protocol is unauthenticated, allowing any machine on the local subnet to send arbitrary commands, including ResetBrowser frames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user can send ResetBrowser frames to shut down legitimate backup browsers, impacting the network's ability to browse resources and services.
*   **Master Browser Usurpation:** By shutting down all browsers, an attacker can force an election and declare their own machine as the new Master Browser. In some cases, if on the same subnet, this could also allow usurpation of the Domain Master Browser.
*   **Manipulation of Browse Lists:** If an attacker becomes the master browser, they can provide incorrect information about the network's services and computers, potentially directing users to malicious resources.
*  **Reduced Network Performance:** A significantly reduced browser population can negatively impact overall network performance.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack is carried out by sending malicious "ResetBrowser" frames over the network.
*   **Local Subnet Requirement:** The attacker must be on the same subnet as the targeted browsers because NetBios is a non-routable protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the targeted subnet.
*   **Ability to Send NetBIOS Frames:** The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious "ResetBrowser" frames, which is possible due to the unauthenticated nature of the protocol.

**Additional Information:**

*   The document clarifies that this vulnerability does *not* affect web browsing, but rather computer browsing related to resource discovery within a network.
*   A patch is available that adds the ability to ignore ResetBrowser frames via a registry setting.
*   The patch provides a registry key called "RefuseReset" that can be set to prevent a machine from responding to ResetBrowser frames.
*   The "MaximumBrowseEntries" registry value is also discussed in the document and is related to the vulnerability described by CVE-2000-0403, but it is relevant for understanding the computer browser protocol, even though this CVE is related to the "ResetBrowser Frame" vulnerability.
*   The document also mentions that if a firewall blocks port 138 UDP, then the vulnerability can't be exploited by external attackers.
