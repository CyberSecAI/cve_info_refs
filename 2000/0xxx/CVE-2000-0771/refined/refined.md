- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists that allows a malicious user to corrupt parts of a Windows 2000 system's local security policy through a complicated series of steps. This corruption can disrupt domain membership and trust relationship information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the local security policy mechanism of Windows 2000. Although unprivileged users should not be able to modify the local security policy, this vulnerability allows a normal user to corrupt it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service condition. If a workstation or member server is attacked, it can effectively remove the machine from the domain. If a domain controller is attacked, it can no longer process domain logon requests, potentially disrupting the entire network. Recovering from such an attack would likely require restoring a known-working configuration from a backup.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through RPC (Remote Procedure Call). Any user who can establish an RPC connection with an affected machine and send the proper command sequence can exploit the vulnerability. This could be an intranet user attacking any machine within the network or an internet user potentially attacking machines on the network edge that allow RPC connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to request services from the target machine via RPC. No special privileges are required, as the RPC services needed to exploit the vulnerability can be requested by any user on a network. The attacker also needs to be able to deliver data to ports 137, 138, 139 and 443 UDP or other networking protocols such as IPX and NetBEUI.
