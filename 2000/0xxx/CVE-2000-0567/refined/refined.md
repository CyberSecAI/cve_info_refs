- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in the Inetcomm.dll component, which is shared by Outlook and Outlook Express. This buffer is used when parsing email headers during mail downloads via POP3 or IMAP4.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow. The vulnerability arises because the email header length isn't checked before being inserted into a buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can cause a denial of service by crashing the email client, or execute arbitrary code on the victim's computer by overflowing the buffer with carefully crafted data.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted email with an overly long header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the victim. The victim must be using Outlook or Outlook Express configured to use POP3 or IMAP4.
