Published: February 22, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** February 22, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in an installation routine associated with MicrosoftÂ® Systems Management Server (SMS). If particular features have been enabled, the vulnerability could allow a user to gain elevated privileges on the local machine.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-012.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-012)

### General Information

## Issue

If the SMS 2.0 Remote Control feature has been installed and enabled on a machine, the folder in which the remote agent resides has its permissions set to Everyone Full Control by default. If a malicious user replaced the client code with code of his or her choosing, it would run automatically in a system context the next time he or she rebooted the machine and logged on. The vulnerability exists only if the Remote Control feature has been enabled - no other SMS features are affected by it.
