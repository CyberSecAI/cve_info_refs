- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the default permissions set on the folder where the SMS 2.0 Remote Control agent resides. These permissions are set to "Everyone Full Control" upon installation and enablement of the Remote Control feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the overly permissive file system permissions. Specifically, allowing "Everyone Full Control" on the remote agent's directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could replace the legitimate client code with their own malicious code. Upon reboot and logon, the malicious code would execute automatically within a system context, leading to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves local access to the affected system's file system. An attacker needs to be able to write to the directory containing the remote agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write files to the directory containing the SMS remote control agent. This implies the attacker would already have to have some level of access to the system. The attacker would need to be able to log onto the machine for the malicious code to run, meaning they would require a valid account.
