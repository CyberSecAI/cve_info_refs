Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities discussed in the context of CVE-2000-0993:

**1. Vulnerabilities related to Format String Bugs:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary cause of the discussed vulnerabilities is the use of format strings in `printf`-like functions (e.g., `fprintf`, `snprintf`, `pw_error`) without proper sanitization of user-supplied data. This allows an attacker to inject format specifiers (`%x`, `%p`, `%n`, etc.) that can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **`fstat`**: The `fstat` utility was vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. The provided exploit code demonstrates how to craft a format string that, when passed to `fstat`, allows arbitrary memory writes and therefore arbitrary code execution.
    *   **`pw_error()`**: The `pw_error(3)` function is vulnerable to a format string bug. It's used in privileged applications (like `chpass`) and therefore is a serious security vulnerability.
    *   **`talkd`**: The `talkd` daemon contains a format string vulnerability in its message formatting code using `snprintf`.
    *   **`photurisd`**: The `photurisd` daemon has a format string vulnerability, likely in a logging function. The provided example demonstrates how crafted input to photurisd causes a crash.
    *   **Multiple privileged programs:**  There are multiple privileged programs with printf-style format string bugs.
    *   **`xlock`**: `xlock` is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can overwrite arbitrary memory locations. Specifically, by using format string specifiers like `%n`, they can overwrite return addresses or function pointers, which can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the vulnerable application (e.g., root if the program is setuid root). The fstat exploit code confirms this, and the description of the `pw_error` also highlights the severity.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Format string vulnerabilities can cause programs to crash.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can use format specifiers (`%x`, `%p`) to leak information from the stack or other memory regions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Line Arguments:** The `fstat`, `eeprom` and `photurisd` vulnerabilities are triggered via command-line arguments.
    *   **Environment Variables:** The `su` exploit leverages a format string in the user's shell environment variable.
    *   **Network Input:** The `talkd` and `photurisd` vulnerabilities occur in daemons and are likely triggered by data sent over the network.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Local User:** For `fstat` and `su` exploits, a local user with shell access is required.
    *   **Network Access:** `talkd` and `photurisd` vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely, given that they are network daemons.
    *   **Privileges:**  Exploitation of setuid programs like `fstat` and other privileged programs using the `pw_error` function, will likely require minimal privileges on the victim machine and will lead to root access.

**2. Other Vulnerabilities Mentioned:**

*   **`su`**: This vulnerability is a format string vulnerability present within the shell environment variable. This attack vector depends on the user being able to set the shell using a third party application.
*   **`libcurses`**: The `libcurses` library has a vulnerability that could allow malicious users to execute arbitrary code by using manipulated terminal descriptions located in `$HOME/.terminfo` or within the `TERMCAP` environment variable.
*   **Telnetd:**  The telnet daemon doesn't sanitize the `TERMINFO`, `TERMINFO_DIRS`, `TERMPATH`, and `TERMCAP` environment variables, allowing for a potential attack vector.
*   **X11 Libraries:** There are multiple vulnerabilities in X11 libraries related to format strings, which could lead to arbitrary code execution and DoS. These are addressed by a single patch in the errata.
*   **Various other fixes:** This includes fixes to `ipf`, `bridge`, `dhclient`, `mopd`, `ftpd`, `sudo`, `readline`, `sendmail` and other components. The fixes are mentioned in the OpenBSD errata but are not related to CVE-2000-0993.

**Summary of CVE-2000-0993 Relevance**

While CVE-2000-0993 is a placeholder, the provided content relates directly to multiple format string vulnerabilities found in OpenBSD. These include vulnerable programs like `fstat`, the `pw_error` function, `talkd`, `photurisd`, and other privileged applications. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution and system compromise. The content reveals the significant impact of these vulnerabilities, the methods of exploitation, and the required attacker capabilities.

The content is relevant to CVE-2000-0993 because it discusses multiple instances of format string vulnerabilities. While there might be separate CVEs assigned for each of these vulnerable programs/libraries, the root cause is identical. The information provides a deeper insight into these format string vulnerabilities in OpenBSD than the default CVE description would provide.
