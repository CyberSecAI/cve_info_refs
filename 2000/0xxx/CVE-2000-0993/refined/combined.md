Hi,
        Here is another exploit for an application (fstat) that
OpenBSD's
format string audit has seemingly forgotten about.  What I would like to
know is why this and a number of other privileged applications have
security vulnerabilities in them. They WERE fixed, but NO ADVISORY nor
ANY MENTION IN THEIR DAILY CHANGLOG!  How can the impact of the
vulnerability not be realized when they occur in something as privileged
as that would be using pw_error()?

What about eeprom?

There is also su, although it is only exploitable by the
usershell=format string,  there is a possibility that somebody have a
third party application set the user shell to something that may be
malicious.  Why no even passing mention in their "Daily Changelog"  or
their security pages?

OK, hold on a second....  The following "snip snip" is a little long...
and I have not verified it, (a guaranteed DoS though).

This is a daemon that runs listening to UDP in part of the OpenBSD IPSEC
suite.  This vulnerability shown here is exploitable through it's faulty
custom logging functions, any of the places where this canned function
is used, there is the potential for exploitation.  I have not fully
audited the source, so I cannot verify an immediate problem, but don't
you think that it should have deserved an honorable mention after a fix
applied?

Where are these advisories from the OpenBSD TEAM?  Is their pride to
great to accept these bugs, code fix, announce patch and move on?

I do not believe that silently fixing vulnerabilities is in the best
interest of anybody.

* **001: SECURITY FIX: May 25, 2000**
    *All architectures*

  A misuse of ipf(8)
  *keep-state* rules can result in firewall rules being bypassed.

  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/001_ipf.patch)
  It updates ipf to version 3.3.16.

  * **002: DRIVER FIX: May 26, 2000**
      *All architectures*

    The
    [ef(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.7/ef.4)
    driver will complain when adding an address with ifconfig
    (ifconfig: SIOCAIFADDR: Invalid argument).

    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/002_ef.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: May 26, 2000**
        *All architectures*

      It is possible to bypass the *learning* flag on an interface if frames
      go directly to the machine acting as a
      [bridge](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.7/bridge.4).

      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/003_bridge.patch)

      * **004: RELIABILITY FIX: May 29, 2000**
          *All architectures*

        Certain routing table modifications by the superuser could cause a system panic.

        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/004_route.patch)

        * **005: RELIABILITY FIX: May 29, 2000**
            *All architectures*

          Parse IPv4 options more carefully. It is not yet clear if this can even be used
          to crash the machine remote or locally.

          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/005_ipopts.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: June 6, 2000**
              *All architectures*

            The non-default UseLogin feature in **/etc/sshd\_config** is broken and should not
            be used. On other operating systems, it results in a hole.

            Avoid use of this feature, or update to OpenSSH 2.1.1 or later if you must use it.

            * **007: RELIABILITY FIX: June 8, 2000**
                *All architectures*

              NFS exporting of CD filesystems caused a system panic.

              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/007_cd9660.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: June 8, 2000**
                  *All architectures*

                Some operations in msdosfs could result in a system panic.

                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/008_msdosfs.patch)

                * **009: SECURITY FIX: June 9, 2000**
                    *All architectures*

                  A serious bug in isakmpd(8) policy handling wherein policy
                  verification could be completely bypassed in isakmpd.

                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/common/009_isakmpd.patch)

                  * **010: CD DISTRIBUTION ERROR: June 15, 2000**

                    On the 2.7 CD media, the **amiga** distribution contains two pairs of archives
                    files for installation, ie:
                    ```

                    ```
                    The installation script will list ALL of these files. For proper
                    operation one should install the **\*.tgz** versions, and deselect
                    the **\*.tar.gz** versions.

                    The FTP area sets do not suffer from this problem.

                    * **011: DRIVER BUG: June 17, 2000**

                      The [an(4)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.7/an.4)
                      Aironet Communications 4500/4800 IEEE 802.11DS driver has a bug which prevents
                      [ancontrol(8)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.7/ancontrol.8) from working correctly, instead causing a panic.

                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.7/i386/011_an.patch)

                      * **012: SECURITY FIX: June 24, 2000**
                          *All architectures*

                        A serious bug in dhclient(8) could allow strings from a malicious dhcp
                        server to be executed in the shell as root.

                        * **013: SECURITY FIX: June 28, 2000**
                            *All architectures*

                          libedit would check for a **.editrc** file in the current directory.
                          That behaviour is not nice; this does not turn into a security problem in
                          any real world situation that we know of, but a patch is available anyways.

                            The PC console driver (PCVT) has two bugs. Display problems can result if
                            reverse video mode is turned on or off twice in a row. This patch also
                            fixes a problem with scrolling region handling that has been seen by many
                            users trying to use the BitchX irc client with the screen program.

                                      ftpd had a remote root hole in it. Luckily, ftpd was not enabled by default.

                                                  Note that the default OpenBSD install is not vulnerable to this, since

                                          'make DESTDIR=/ build' or you will get an error in the last
                                          step of the build (makewhatis). If you forget to set DESTDIR you can
                                          ignore the build error. The whatis database will be rebuilt the next
                                          time /etc/weekly runs.

                                          * **022: INSTALLATION FIX: July 14, 2000**

                                            The MacOS installer shipped with OpenBSD 2.7 does not correctly make all
                                            devices, specifically it does not make the `/dev/arandom` device
                                            needed for the userland crypto such as ssh to work. The problem shows itself
                                            when ssh-keygen fails to make RSA or DSA keys, resulting in messages like
                                            **RSA-generate\_keys failed** or **DSA-generate\_keys failed**.

                                            To work around this, once your machine is up and running run the following
                                            commands as root:
                                            ```

                                            # cd /dev
                                            # ./MAKEDEV arandom

                                            ```

                                            After doing this (and possibly installing one of the ssl27 packages),
                                            reboot your machine and it will generate ssh keys correctly.
