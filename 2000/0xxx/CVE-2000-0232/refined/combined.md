## Patch Available for "Malformed TCP/IP Print Request" Vulnerability

Published: March 30, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** March 30, 2000

### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the TCP/IP Printing Services for MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® 4.0 and WindowsÂ® 2000. If this service is installed, the vulnerability could allow a malicious user to disrupt printing services.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-021.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-021).

### General Information

## Issue

TCP/IP Printing Services is an RFC 1179-compliant printing service designed for environments that use the Berkeley Remote Printing protocols, also known as LPD and LPR. (In Windows 2000, TCP/IP Printing Services are also known as Print Services for Unix). A specially-malformed print request could cause TCPSVC.EXE to crash, which would not only prevent the server from providing printing services, but also would stop several other services, most importantly DHCP. Any affected services could be put back into service by restarting them; it would not be necessary to reboot the machine.

It is important to note that TCP/IP Printing Services is different from the native Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 printing services. TCP/IP Printing Services is not installed by default, and the vulnerability at hand here would not allow a malicious user to disrupt printing via the native Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 printing services.
