## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.

ACROS Security Problem Report #2000-04-06-1-PUB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bypassing Warnings For Invalid SSL Certificates In Netscape Navigator
=========================================================================
FULL REPORT PUBLIC
======
Affected System(s): Netscape Navigator & Communicator
Problem: Bypassing Warnings For Invalid SSL Certificates
Severity: High
Solution: Installing the Personal Security Manager or
Installing the newest Netscape Communicator (v4.73)
Discovered: April 3, 2000
Vendor notified: April 4, 2000
Last update: May 10, 2000
Published: May 10, 2000
SUMMARY
=======
Our team has discovered a flaw in Netscape Navigator that allows bypassing
of warning about an invalid SSL certificate. SSL protection is used in most
major Internet-based financial services (e-banking, e-commerce). The flaw
we have found effectively disables one of the two basic SSL functionalities:
to assure users that they are really communicating with the intended web
server - and not with a fake one.
Using this flaw, the attacker can make users send secret information (like
credit card data and passwords) to his web server rather than the real one -
EVEN IF THE COMMUNICATION IS PROTECTED BY SSL PROTOCOL.
INTRODUCTION (skip this section if you already understand how SSL works)
============
When a web browser tries to connect to a SSL-protected server, a so-called
SSL session is established. At the beginning of this session the server
presents his SSL certificate containing his public key. At this point,
browser checks the certificate for the following conditions (\*):
1) Certificate must be issued by a certificate authority trusted by browser
(some are default: Verisign, Thawte etc.)
2) Certificate must not be expired (its expiry date:time must be later than
the current system date:time on the computer browser is running on)
3) Certificate must be for the server that browser is connecting to (if
browser is connecting to www.e-bank.com, the certificate must be for
www.e-bank.com)
All three conditions must be met for browser to accept the certificate. For
every condition not met, browser should display a warning to the user and
then user can decide whether connection should be established or not.
These three conditions combined provide user with assurance that his browser
is really connecting to the correct server and not to some fake server
placed on the Internet by malicious individual(s) trying to trick users to
give them credit card information, passwords and other secret information.
For example, let's take a look at a sample web e-banking system that doesn't
use SSL certificates and requires one-time password tokens for user
authentication. User connects to http://www.e-bank.com. Browser asks DNS
server for IP address of www.e-bank.com and gets 100.100.100.100. Browser
then connects to 100.100.100.100 and user is presented with login form
asking for his username and one-time password. He enters this data and
starts using e-banking services.
A simple attack (called web-spoofing) on this system is to attack the DNS
server and "poison" its entry for www.e-bank.com with attacker's IP address
99.99.99.99. Attacker sets up a web server at 99.99.99.99 that web-wise
looks exactly like the original www.e-bank.com server. User trying to
connect to www.e-bank.com will now instead connect to the attacker's server
and provide it with his one-time password. Attacker's server will use this
password to connect to the real server at 100.100.100.100 and transfer all
of the user's money to his secret Swiss bank account ;-).
This attack is successfully disabled by using SSL protocol. In that
case, when browser falsely connects to www.e-bank.com at 99.99.99.99 rather
than to 100.100.100.100, attacker's server must provide a valid certificate
for www.e-bank.com, which it can't unless the attacker has stolen the secret
key and the certificate from the real server. Let's look at three
possibilities:
1) Attacker could issue a certificate for www.e-bank.com himself (on his own
CA). That wouldn't work since his CA is not trusted by user's browser.
2) Attacker could use a stolen expired key and certificate (those are often
not protected as strongly as valid ones since one could think they can't
be used any more). That wouldn't work since browser will notice that
certificate is expired.
3) Attacker could use a valid key and certificate for some other site (e.g.
www.something.org). That wouldn't work since browser will accept only
valid certificates for www.e-bank.com.
It would seem that this problem of web-spoofing is successfully solved with
SSL certificates.
PROBLEM
=======
There is a flaw in implementation of SSL certificate checks in Netscape
Navigator.
The Flaw
--------
Netscape Navigator correctly checks the certificate conditions (\*) at the
beginning of a SSL session it establishes with a certain web server.
The flaw is, while this SSL session is still alive, all HTTPS
connections to \*THAT SERVER'S IP ADDRESS\* are assumed to be a part of this
session (and therefore certificate conditions are not checked again).
Instead of comparing hostnames to those of currently open sessions, Navigator
compares IP addresses. Since more than one hostname can have the same IP
address, there is a great potential for security breach.
This behavior is not in compliance with SSL specification.
DEMONSTRATION
=============
The following will try to demonstrate the flaw. It is assumed that for
redirecting user's web traffic, the attacker will generally use "DNS
poisoning" or reconfiguring routers, while in our demonstration we will
use the HOSTS file on client computer to get the same effect and make it
easier to reproduce the flaw.
In this demonstration, we will make Navigator open Thawte's homepage over
secure (HTTPS) connection while requesting Verisign's home address at
https://www.verisign.com.
Thawte's and Verisign's homepages are used as examples - this would work
just the same on any other secured web sites.
1) First, add the following line to the local HOSTS file on the computer
running the Navigator and save it:
207.240.177.177 www.verisign.com
This will make the computer (and, consequently, the browser) think that IP
address of www.verisign.com (which is actually 205.139.94.60) is in fact
207.240.177.177 (which is actually IP address of www.thawte.com).
At this point it is important to note that SSL, if correctly implemented,
provides protection against such "domain name spoofing", because while the
browser will connect to the wrong server, that server will not be able to
provide a valid SSL certificate and the SSL session will not be
established (not without user being warned about the certificate).
2) Close all instances of Navigator to clean any cached IP addresses.
3) Open Navigator and go to https://www.thawte.com. It works as it should -
Thawte's server provides a valid SSL certificate for its hostname
(www.thawte.com) and so the SSL session is established.
4) With the same instance of Navigator, go to https://www.verisign.com. Now
watch the Thawte's homepage appear again WITHOUT ANY WARNINGS!
What happened here? In step 3), Navigator looked up the IP address for
www.thawte.com (from the DNS server) and found 207.240.177.177. It tried to
establish a SSL session with that IP address and correctly checked all three
certificate conditions (\*) - indeed, if any of them weren't true, a warning
would pop up.
In step 4), Navigator looked up the IP address for www.verisign.com (this
time from HOSTS file, but it could easily have been from the same DNS server)
and found again 207.240.177.177. Now, since there was already one SSL session
open with that IP address, Navigator \*INCORRECTLY\* decided to use that
session instead of establishing another one.
EXPLOIT
=======
This exploit will show how the flaw could be used to gather user's secret
information.
Assume there is a web bookstore at www.thebookstore.com. Users go to
http://www.thebookstore.com (via normal HTTP connection), browse the
books and add them to their virtual shopping baskets. At the check-out,
they are directed to a secure order form (e.g.
https://www.thebookstore.com/order\_form.html) where they enter their
personal and credit card information which is then submitted (again via
secure HTTPS connection) to the server. This is a typical web e-commerce
concept.
Assume that IP address of www.thebookstore.com is 100.100.100.100.
The attacker sets up his own web server with IP address 99.99.99.99 and
installs on it a valid SSL certificate for host www.attacker.com (he could
have purchased this certificate from e.g. Verisign if he owns the domain
attacker.com; he could have stolen the certificate or he could have broken
into a web server with a certificate already installed).
The attacker makes this web server function as a gateway to
www.thebookstore.com - meaning that all requests are forwarded to
www.thebookstore.com, so virtually this server "looks and feels" exactly like
the real www.thebookstore.com. There is just one difference: the page before
the order form (e.g. http://www.thebookstore.com/basket.html)
contains a small (1x1) image originating from https://www.attacker.com
(secure HTTPS connection).
Then, the attacker "poisons" a heavily used DNS server so that it will return
99.99.99.99 for requests about www.thebookstore.com (normally it returns
100.100.100.100).
What happens then?
All users of that DNS server who will try to visit (via normal HTTP)
http://www.thebookstore.com will connect to 99.99.99.99 instead of
100.100.100.100 but will not notice anything because everything will look
just the way it should. They will browse the books and add them to their
shopping baskets and at check-out, they will be presented with the order form
https://www.thebookstore.com/order\_form.html.
But the previous HTML page containing the hyperlink to the order form will
also contain a small (1x1) image with source https://www.attacker.com/a.gif.
Navigator will successfully download this image and for that it will
establish a SSL session with www.attacker.com. This session then stays open.
When the order form is accessed, Navigator tries to establish another SSL
session, this time to www.thebookstore.com. Since DNS server claims this
server has the same IP address as www.attacker.com (99.99.99.99), Navigator
will use the existing SSL session with 99.99.99.99 and will not check the
certificate.
The result: Navigator is displaying a SECURE ORDER FORM that it believes to
be originating from the genuine server www.thebookstore.com while in fact
it is originating from the fake one. No warning about an invalid certificate
is issued to the user so he also believes to be safe.
When user submits his secret information, it goes to (through) the attacker's
server where it is collected for massive abuse.
For users to notice the foul play they would have to look at the certificate
properties while on a "secure" page https://www.thebookstore.com/...
The properties would show that the certificate used was issued for host
www.attacker.com.
Also, monitoring network traffic would show that the server is not at
100.100.100.100 where it should be but rather at 99.99.99.99.
It is a very rare practice to check any of these when nothing suspect is
happening.
Notes
-----
It should be noted that in the previous exploit, if the users tried to
access https://www.thebookstore.com over secure (HTTPS) connection from
the very start, Navigator would issue a warning. It is imperative for the
exploit to work that some time \*before\* the first secure connection to
https://www.thebookstore.com a successful secure connection is made to
https://www.attacker.com. That's why a valid certificate must be installed
on www.attacker.com.
Also, it should be noted that Navigator's SSL sessions don't last forever.
We haven't been able to predict the duration of these sessions
(it seems to be depending on many things like inactivity time, total time
etc.) and we also haven't investigated the possible effects of SSL
session resuming.
SOLUTION
========
Netscape has (even prior to our notification - see the Acknowledgments
section) provided a Navigator Add-on called Personal Security Manager (PSM),
freely downloadable at:
http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/download/detail\_128\_316.html
Installation of PSM, as far as we have tested it, corrects the identified
flaw.
Netscape Communicator (v4.73) currently includes the fix for this
vulnerability. It is available for download at:
http://home.netscape.com/download/
WORKAROUND
==========
Navigator/Communicator users who can't or don't want to install PSM can use
a "manual" method to make sure they are not under attack:
When visiting an SSL-protected site, double click on the lock icon (bottom
left corner) or the key icon (in older browsers) and see whether the
certificate used for the connection is really issued for the correct
hostname. E.g. If you visit https://www.verisign.com, make sure the
certificate used is issued for www.verisign.com and not for some other
hostname.
ADVISORY
========
It is important to emphasize that the flaw presented completely compromises
SSL's ability to provide strong server authentication and therefore poses
a serious threat to Navigator users relying on its SSL protection.
Users of web services
---------------------
Netscape Navigator/Communicator users who are also users of any critical web
services employing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protection to provide secrecy
and integrity of browser-server communication are strongly advised to
install Personal Security Manager or upgrade to Communicator 4.73 and thus
disable this vulnerability.
Main examples of such critical web services are:
- web banking systems (especially the ones using passwords for
authentication - even one-time passwords),
- web stores (especially the ones accepting credit card data) and
- other web-based e-commerce systems.
Providers of web services
-------------------------
Providers of critical web services employing Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
protection to provide secrecy and integrity of browser-server communication
should advise their users to install Personal Security Manager or upgrade to
Communicator 4.73 and thus disable this vulnerability.
Since this vulnerability allows for the type of attack that can completely
bypass the real/original web server, there are no technical countermeasures
which providers of web services could deploy at their sites.
Web services using client SSL certificates for user authentication
------------------------------------------------------------------
This vulnerability does NOT allow the attacker to steal client's SSL key
and thus execute the man-in-the-middle attack on web services using client
SSL certificates for user authentication. It still does, however, allow
the attacker to place a fake server (an exact copy) and collect other
information users provide (including the data in their client SSL
certificates).
