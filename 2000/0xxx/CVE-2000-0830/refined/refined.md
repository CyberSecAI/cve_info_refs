- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in the WebTV for Windows application that doesn't correctly handle a specific malformed input string.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can remotely crash the WebTV for Windows application and/or the entire computer system. This would cause a temporary service disruption, requiring a restart of the application or the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed input string to an affected machine. If the machine is connected to the Internet, the attack can be performed remotely over the internet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send data to a system running the vulnerable WebTV for Windows application. This can be achieved over a local network or through the internet if the affected machine is connected.
