Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-0929:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the interaction between RTF-enabled email clients (like Outlook and Outlook Express) and a specific OCX control associated with Windows Media Player 7. This flaw is triggered when the email client attempts to close an email containing a programmatically embedded instance of the vulnerable OCX control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness lies in the way the email client handles closing embedded OCX controls.
- The vulnerability is specifically present in the interaction between the Windows Media Player 7 OCX control and RTF email clients.
- The ability to programmatically embed the vulnerable OCX control into an RTF email message is a critical factor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the user's email client to fail/crash when closing an email containing the malicious embedded OCX control.
- The user will need to restart the email client to restore normal operation.
- No data loss occurs as a result of the exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through malicious RTF emails.
- An attacker must programmatically craft an email with an embedded instance of the vulnerable Windows Media Player OCX control.
- The crafted email is then sent to a target user who is using an affected email client (Outlook or Outlook Express).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must be able to craft a malicious RTF email with a programmatically embedded instance of the vulnerable OCX control.
- The attacker must be able to send this email to a victim who uses an affected email client.
- The attacker needs knowledge of how to programmatically embed the OCX control into an email, which is not a standard or supported method.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability only exists when both Windows Media Player 7 and an affected email client are installed on the same machine.
- The vulnerability does not impact Windows Media Player 7 itself, only the email client.
- The vulnerability cannot be triggered through the email preview pane.
- The issue was reported by Luciano Martins of USSR Labs.
