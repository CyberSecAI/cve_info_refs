- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TCP/IP stack in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 generated predictable Initial Sequence Numbers (ISNs).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable ISNs. The patch improves randomness, providing 15 bits of entropy.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Predictable ISNs could be exploited to carry out IP address spoofing and session hijacking attacks.
- **Attack vectors:**  Network-based attacks exploiting the predictability of TCP sequence numbers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or predict the TCP sequence numbers being generated by the vulnerable system.
