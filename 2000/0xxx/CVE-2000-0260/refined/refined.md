- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the `Dvwssr.dll` component, which is part of Visual Interdev 1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in `Dvwssr.dll`.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Causing the web server to crash.
    - Potentially allowing arbitrary code execution on the server in a System context.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Overrunning the buffer in `Dvwssr.dll` with random data.
    - This could be achieved if the permissions on the folder containing `Dvwssr.dll` were set inappropriately or if the DLL was copied to a folder with lower permissions, allowing unauthorized users to execute it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Initially, an attacker would need web author privileges, as the `Dvwssr.dll` is located in a directory with permissions that limit its execution to web authors.
    - However, if permissions are changed, or the DLL copied to a directory with lower permissions, any user could exploit it.
