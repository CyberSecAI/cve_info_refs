The content mentions security holes in `majordomo` (wrapper, resend) and `orion` (pis, mkpis) packages distributed with SCO's Skunkware CD. It clarifies that these are not SCO security holes, but rather vulnerabilities in the distributed versions of these third-party packages. The content also states that the distributed exploit for components of `orion` will not work on a system with all security patches installed.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerabilities are present in the distributed versions of the `majordomo` and `orion` packages included in SCO's Skunkware CD. These are not vulnerabilities in the core SCO system itself, but rather in third-party software packaged by SCO.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The specific nature of the vulnerabilities in `majordomo` and `orion` is not described, but it is indicated that there are security holes.  The content mentions "wrapper" and "resend" in the context of `majordomo`, and "pis" and "mkpis" in the context of `orion`, which may be related to the vulnerable components.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: The impact of the vulnerabilities are not described, however, the reference to "security holes" indicates that exploitation could lead to unauthorized access or control over affected systems.
*   **Attack vectors**: The content mentions the existence of a "distributed exploit" for the `orion` package, indicating that exploits are publicly available.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The content suggests that the vulnerabilities are exploitable on systems running the affected versions of `majordomo` and `orion` as distributed by SCO. It also implies that attackers would need access to these systems, likely with network access since exploits were "distributed."

The content provides more context than a typical CVE description might, by specifying that the vulnerabilities are not in SCOâ€™s core system, and they are in 3rd party software packaged with SCO Skunkware.
