**CVE-2000-0098 (Internet Data Query Vulnerability):**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the error message returned by Index Server when a user requests a non-existent Internet Data Query (.idq) file.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The error message discloses the physical path to the web directory.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: While it does not allow for direct modification or viewing of data, it acts as a reconnaissance tool, revealing the server's file structure. A variant of this vulnerability could allow a malicious user to read files.
*   **Attack vectors**: By requesting a non-existent .idq file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server.
