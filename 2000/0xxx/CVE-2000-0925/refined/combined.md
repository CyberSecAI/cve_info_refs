All,

We have not released this for the past week at the vendors
request. This was to enable them to notify all registered
users about this vulnerability and to provide a work around.

We have taken the unusual step of including the vendors
response to our original advisory release in full. This
was due to the fact that vendor did not indicate to us
that there was going to be a fix but rather is was down
to the user (or their ISP) to secure the installation.

I. Description
============================================================================

Vendor URL: <http://www.smartwin.com.au/smartwin.htm>

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in CyberOffice Shopping Cart v2 under Windows NT.

Severity: high - Database access by default

It is possible with default installations (according to vendor instructions)
of CyberOffice to gain access to the database which holds information on
customer orders, details and credit card information. This data is held in
an unprotected and un-encrypted Microsoft Access Database.

example: <http://127.0.0.1/_private/shopping_cart.mdb>

By default the _private directory is world readable and accessable by any
anonymous web users. The vendor does however state in the documentation
that the /_private/ directory should not be browsable (i.e. if the file
name is known it can still be downloaded).

II. Delphis Solution
============================================================================

Vendor Status: Informed (See Section III.)

Currently Delphis recommend the following:

 o Within IIS (Internet Information Server) manager set the directory
   permissions to write but NOT read. This will enable users to update the
   database as required by the application but not be able to download it.

-or-

 o Migrate from Access to SQL

III. Vendor Comments
============================================================================

Yes SmartWin is aware of the problem from the begining since the release of
the program.

It is a shame that FrontPage does not automatically disable /_private from
browsing. In all of our documents we have stressed this point enough to
cause the ISP to take action to protect the folder. Because it is the ISP
who is required to ultimately fix the problem, the installation is powerless
in that regard.

In addition to the solutions you have given. These are the more common
actions:

1) Use IIS Managemant Console to disable the Read permission on the folder
(done by ISP)

2) Use FrontPage Explorer to disable the folder from being browsed (done by
the Web master)

3) Move the database to /fpdb (the database folder used by newer versions of
FrontPage).

How to protect databases from being directly downloaded is the problem that
every ISP  faces everyday. SmartWin has given sufficient warning toward this
issue. It should NOT be classified as CyberShop's problem. We have given
warning through out the programs to bring users' attention to this potential
problem to let ISP to fix it (as only the administrator can fix the
permission).

Thanks for providing your research result to us.

Best Regards,

Yong CHEN
