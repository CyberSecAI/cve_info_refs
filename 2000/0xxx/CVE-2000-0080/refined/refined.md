- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `techlibss` program, used for installing IBM's AIX service CDs, creates log files in `/tmp` using shell redirection. It blindly follows symbolic links, leading to arbitrary file overwrites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Symbolic Link Following:** The program does not validate symbolic links and overwrites the target file.
    - **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By creating a symbolic link with the log file name, an attacker can make the program overwrite any file on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite critical system files, leading to system compromise.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker needs to create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory with the same name as the log file created by `techlibss`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have local access to the system to create symbolic links in `/tmp`.
