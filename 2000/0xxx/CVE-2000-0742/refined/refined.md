- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Microsoft IPX/SPX protocol implementation (NWLink) in Windows 95, 98, and 98 Second Edition incorrectly processes IPX ping packets with a broadcast address as the source address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of malformed IPX ping packets where the source network address is set to a broadcast address. Instead of dropping such packets, the affected systems respond to the broadcast address, leading to a potential broadcast storm and system failure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition. This includes a "broadcast storm" that can overwhelm the network and cause affected machines to fail by attempting to process their own responses. Machines experiencing failure can be restored to normal operation by rebooting.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a specifically crafted IPX ping packet with a broadcast address as the source to vulnerable machines. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable machines or on a network that allows the delivery of IPX packets to the targeted machines.
    - The attacker needs the ability to send a malformed IPX ping packet.
    - The target machines must have the NWLink (IPX/SPX) protocol installed, which is not a default installation in Windows 98 and 98SE but can be present in Windows 95 if a network card was present during installation.
