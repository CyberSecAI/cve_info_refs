- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer exists in the RTF reader when parsing control words.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is caused by a malformed control word in an RTF file that triggers an unchecked buffer, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is denial of service, causing affected applications to crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a malicious RTF file containing a malformed control word. This can be done through email attachments or when previewing such emails.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to deliver the malicious RTF file to a user of a vulnerable application and platform, typically by email. The user does not need to open the file directly if the preview mode is enabled, allowing the attack to occur automatically.
