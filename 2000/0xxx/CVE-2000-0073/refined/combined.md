## Patch Available for "Malformed RTF Control Word" Vulnerability

Published: January 17, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the Rich Text Format (RTF) reader that ships as part of MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® 95 and 98, and Windows NTÂ® 4.0. Under certain conditions, the vulnerability could be used to cause email programs to crash.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-005.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-005)

### General Information

## Issue

RTF files consist of text and control information. The control information is specified via directives called control words. The default RTF reader that ships as part of many Windows platforms has an unchecked buffer in the portion of the reader that parses control words. If an RTF file contains a specially-malformed control word, it could cause the application to crash.

Microsoft believes that this is a denial of service vulnerability only, and that there is no capability to use this vulnerability to run arbitrary code. The most serious risk from this vulnerability would result if a user had preview mode enabled on a mail program like Outlook, and received an email that exploited the vulnerability. Because preview mode causes the mail to be parsed without user assent, the mail program would continue to crash until a subsequent mail was received or the mail program was started with preview mode disabled.
