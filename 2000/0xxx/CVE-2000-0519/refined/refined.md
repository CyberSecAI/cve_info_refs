Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-0519:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from Internet Explorer's failure to re-validate SSL certificates when a new SSL session is established with the same server during the same browser session. IE caches previously validated certificates and reuses them without re-checking for validity.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper certificate revalidation: IE does not revalidate certificates for subsequent SSL sessions with the same server within the same IE session. This means that if a malicious user manages to replace the server or perform DNS poisoning after the initial successful validation, the browser will still use the cached, potentially invalid certificate, for later connections.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack: An attacker could potentially intercept and decrypt the communication between a user and a legitimate website by presenting a bogus certificate that is accepted by the browser due to the lack of revalidation. This would allow the attacker to impersonate the trusted site.
- Data theft: By successfully impersonating a trusted website, an attacker could steal sensitive user data transmitted via the encrypted channel.
- Session hijacking: An attacker could hijack the user's session with the website, potentially performing malicious actions in the user's name.

**Attack vectors:**
- DNS cache poisoning: An attacker can manipulate DNS records to redirect traffic intended for a legitimate server to their own malicious server.
- Server replacement: The attacker could physically replace the server or interpose their machine between the user and the legitimate server.
- Timing attack: The attacker needs to perform the malicious action (DNS poisoning or server replacement) between the initial and subsequent SSL sessions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform DNS poisoning or physically replace/interpose a server.
- The attack requires that the user had previously established an SSL session with the target server during the same IE session, as the vulnerability lies in the browser's failure to re-validate cached certificates.
-  The attack is opportunistic as the malicious user cannot compel anyone to connect to their server, and depends on the victim visiting the trusted site first to create the cached certificate entry.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and 5.x, but not 5.01 SP1 or 5.5.
-  The Microsoft document also clarifies that the patch for this issue was included in a later-released patch (MS00-055).
- The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description, giving a specific scenario and explanation of the vulnerability.
