# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-004 - Important

## Patch Available for 'RDISK Registry Enumeration File' Vulnerability

Published: January 21, 2000 | Updated: February 04, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** January 21, 2000

**Revised: February** 4, 2000

#### Summary

On January 21, 2000, Microsoft released the original version of this bulletin, discussing a security vulnerability in a MicrosoftÂ® Windows NT 4.0 administrative utility. The original version of the bulletin discussed the vulnerability within the context of Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition. However, we have since learned of scenarios under which the vulnerability could also affect Windows NT 4.0 servers and workstations, and have revised the bulletin accordingly.

The utility creates a temporary file during execution that can contain security-sensitive information, but does not appropriately restrict access to it. Under certain conditions, it could be possible for a malicious user to read the file as it was being created

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-004.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-004).

### General Information

## Issue

The RDISK utility is used to create an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) in order to record machine state information as a contingency against system failure. During execution, RDISK creates a temporary file containing an enumeration of the registry. The ACLs on the file allow global read permission, and as a result, a malicious user who knew that the administrator was running RDISK could open the file and read the registry enumeration information as it was being created. RDISK erases the file upon successful completion, so under normal conditions there would be no lasting vulnerability.

By default, the file is not shared and therefore could not be read by other network users.
