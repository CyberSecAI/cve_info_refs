- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RDISK utility creates a temporary file containing an enumeration of the registry during execution. The Access Control Lists (ACLs) on this temporary file allow global read permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure temporary file creation with overly permissive ACLs allowing global read access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user, with knowledge that the administrator is running RDISK, can open and read the temporary file containing the registry enumeration as it is being created. The registry enumeration can contain security-sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the file system while the RDISK utility is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to access the local file system during the execution of the RDISK utility by an administrator and be aware that the utility is being run.
