- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Data Transformation Service (DTS) packages in SQL Server 7.0 and the Enterprise Manager Server registration dialog do not adequately protect passwords. Passwords are masked with asterisks in the Properties dialog, but can be programmatically retrieved in plaintext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of passwords in DTS packages and Enterprise Manager Server registration dialog.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Malicious users can compromise passwords associated with DTS packages or server registrations. This could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to databases and other resources.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Programmatically interrogating the Properties dialog of a DTS package
    - Programmatically interrogating the Registered Server dialog through Enterprise Manager
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the DTS package or the server registration information.
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to view the Properties page of the DTS package or the Registered Server dialog.
    - The attacker needs to be able to programmatically interrogate the password from the dialog.
