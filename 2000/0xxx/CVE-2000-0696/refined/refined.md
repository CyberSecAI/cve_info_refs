The content is related to CVE-2000-0696.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Sun Solaris AnswerBook2 dwhttpd server has two vulnerabilities:
1.  An unauthenticated user can add a new administrative user via a CGI script.
2.  Arbitrary commands can be executed due to insufficient input sanitization when rotating log files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Authentication Bypass:** The administrative CGI script allows adding new users without requiring prior authentication.
2.  **Command Injection:** The log rotation functionality allows for injecting shell commands by specifying a malicious target file name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  **Administrative Access:** Attackers can gain full access to the AnswerBook2 administration interface, allowing them to manage document collections, view logs and manage contents.
2.  **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the host system with the privileges of the user running the web server (typically user 'daemon', uid=1).

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Unauthenticated User Creation:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the administrative CGI script to create a new administrative user.
2.  **Log Rotation Command Injection:** Using the administrative interface to rotate logs by specifying a malicious target filename containing shell commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable AnswerBook2 server. No prior authentication is needed to exploit the user creation vulnerability, while administrative access is required to exploit the command injection through log rotation.
