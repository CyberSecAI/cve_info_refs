- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An incorrect assignment in the ftpcmd.y file allows a remote user to execute certain FTP commands without authorization. The code incorrectly sets the result of a command to 1 instead of using the actual command result ($1).

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unauthorized command execution.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
  - A remote user can perform denial of service attacks.
  - An attacker with local account access can gain unauthorized root access.

- **Attack vectors**:
   - Sending specially crafted FTP commands to the vulnerable daemon over the network.
  
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Network access to the vulnerable FTP daemon.
    - For root access, requires access to a local account.
