Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2000-0728:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue lies in the insecure handling of temporary files and URL-type links within the xpdf application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Race Condition with `tmpnam()` and `fopen()`:**
    *   The application uses `tmpnam()` to generate a temporary file name and then `fopen()` to open a file with that name.
    *   A race condition exists where an attacker can create a symbolic link with the generated temporary filename between the calls to `tmpnam()` and `fopen()`.
    *   If the attacker creates a symlink to another file, when xpdf opens the file, it will overwrite the file pointed to by the symlink.

2.  **Unsanitized URL Handling:**
    *   xpdf calls `system()` with a netscape (or similar) command plus the URL from PDF documents.
    *   Malicious URL links containing quote characters in PDF documents can be used to execute arbitrary shell commands due to the lack of proper input sanitization when passed to the `system()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Overwrite (Race Condition):**
    *   A local attacker can overwrite arbitrary files, but only if they are able to create the symlink between the calls to `tmpnam()` and `fopen()`.
    *   This requires root privileges.

2.  **Arbitrary Command Execution (Unsanitized URL Handling):**
    *   An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running xpdf.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Race Condition:** The attacker needs local access to exploit the race condition and must have root privileges. The attack involves creating a symlink with the generated filename after `tmpnam()` has been called, but before `fopen()` is called.
2.  **Unsanitized URLs:** The attacker can embed a malicious URL in a PDF document with characters such as quotes, which will be passed to the `system()` function allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Race Condition:**
    *   Local access to the system.
    *   Root privileges to create symlinks and overwrite files.
2.  **Unsanitized URLs:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a PDF document containing the malicious link, with the target user opening the file with a vulnerable version of xpdf.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that xpdf is not a SUID binary, so any arbitrary command execution would be limited to the privileges of the user running xpdf.
*   The vulnerabilities are fixed in xpdf version 0.91.
*   Multiple Linux distributions (Mandrake and Conectiva) released security advisories and updated packages to address the vulnerabilities.
