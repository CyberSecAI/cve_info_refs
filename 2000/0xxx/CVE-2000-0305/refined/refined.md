- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the code that performs IP fragment reassembly.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of malformed fragmented IP datagrams.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A continuous stream of specially crafted fragmented IP datagrams can cause the affected machine to devote most or all of its CPU to processing them, leading to a denial of service. In some cases, it may even cause the machine to crash, though affected machines will return to normal service shortly after the malicious packets stop arriving.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a continuous stream of malformed fragmented IP datagrams to a vulnerable machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable machine. Machines on the edge of the network like web servers and proxy servers are the most likely to be affected, since firewalls and proxies might drop the malicious packets.
