[![SimpleServer:WWW Screenshot](/contents/graphics/screenshot/sswww.gif "SimpleServer:WWW Screenshot")](/contents/download/Network/sswww/Screenshots.htm)    Ever wanted to set up a webserver so that you could have your friends check out a new page you're working on? Or maybe you'd just like to play around with HTML, and need to have a local webserver to get a good feel... Whichever the case, you've probably discovered that most of the webservers out there are, how should I put this, interface challenged. Sure, you can run Apache on your machine, but only after a couple hours hacking on cryptic text files, but now there's a better option...
     Introducing AnalogX SimpleServer:WWW, the first in a series of simple to use yet powerful servers! This webserver is SO easy to use, about the only thing you need to know how to do is drag and drop files, then just click on the 'Start' button, and your webserver is up and running, serving your pages to the world! Best of all, SimpleServer minimizes to the system tray, so it doesn't take up valuable screen space when you're not working with it.
     SimpleServer:WWW supports MIME file typing, CGI, common log format, and multi-hosting, just to name a few! If you've always wanted a compact, easy to use, versatile webserver, then your prayers have been answered!

SimpleServer:WWW works on **all** versions of Windows, from Window 95 to Windows 7 and everything inbetween (including XP, Vista, Win2k, etc). If you have a general question related to any of the programs on the site, or would like some additional info related to the downloads in general, then check out the [downloads FAQ](/contents/download/faq.htm).
