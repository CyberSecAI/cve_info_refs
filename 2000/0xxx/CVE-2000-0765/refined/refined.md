- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The HTML interpreter used by Microsoft Office 2000 applications contains an unchecked buffer in the module that interprets embedded object tags. This lack of bounds checking allows for a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the HTML interpreter when processing malformed object tags within HTML files embedded in Office documents.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Crash of the Office 2000 application.
    - Execution of arbitrary code on the victim's computer, with privileges equivalent to the victim user. This could include reformatting the hard drive, communicating with external websites, or changing data.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user creates a specially crafted HTML file containing a malformed object tag and saves it as an Office document. The user then needs to entice a victim into opening the malicious document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious HTML file and deliver it to the victim. The victim must then open the file in an affected Office 2000 application.
