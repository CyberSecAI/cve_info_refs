- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in NetMeeting's Remote Desktop Sharing feature where it does not correctly handle a specific type of malformed input string sent by a malicious client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling of malformed input strings leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A successful exploit can cause the NetMeeting application to hang, leading to denial of service and high (100%) CPU utilization. Existing NetMeeting sessions would fail, and the affected machine may be hindered from performing other tasks.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious client sends a specially crafted malformed string to the affected machine via the port on which NetMeeting is listening (port 1720).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send data to the affected machine. This could be from the Internet if the machine is directly connected, or from an internal network if the affected machine is only accessible on the intranet. The NetMeeting application with Remote Desktop Sharing must be enabled.
