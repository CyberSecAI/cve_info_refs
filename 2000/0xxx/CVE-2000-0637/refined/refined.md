- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An implementation error in the Microsoft Excel `REGISTER.ID` worksheet function allows any DLL to be referenced from a worksheet without warning to the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `REGISTER.ID` function, by design, can reference DLLs. However, it lacks a mechanism to prevent the execution of arbitrary DLLs, allowing a malicious DLL to be invoked without user consent when the worksheet is opened.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious DLL can be executed on the user's computer, allowing the attacker to perform any action that the user could perform. This includes potentially accessing, modifying, or deleting data, installing malware, or taking control of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would create a malicious DLL and then create an Excel worksheet that uses the `REGISTER.ID` function to reference this malicious DLL. The attacker would need to either place the malicious DLL on the victim's local computer or on a network share accessible to the victim.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious DLL and craft an Excel worksheet to invoke it using `REGISTER.ID`. They also need to deliver the malicious DLL to the victim's machine or a network location accessible to the victim.
