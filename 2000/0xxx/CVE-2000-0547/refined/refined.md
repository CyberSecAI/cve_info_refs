Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**Vulnerability 1: Buffer Overflow in Kerberos 4 KDC**

*   **Root Cause:** A static buffer within the Kerberos 4 KDC code can be overflowed by sending specially crafted, corrupt requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Static buffer allocation without proper bounds checking.
    *   Use of `strcpy` without length limitations when copying realm names into `local_realm`.
    *   Lack of checks on lengths of various fields in the request.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by corrupting long-term state in the KDC process, potentially causing it to return errors for all principals.
    *   Issuing of bogus tickets.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attacker sends a crafted Kerberos request to the KDC process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote network access to the KDC service.

**Vulnerability 2: Double-Free in krb5-1.1.x KDC (Kerberos 4 Compatibility Code)**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory management bug exists in the Kerberos 4 compatibility code within the krb5-1.1.x KDC.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Double-free vulnerability in memory deallocation routines.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Potential crash of the KDC process due to segmentation violation or malloc pool corruption.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attacker sends a crafted request that triggers the vulnerable code path in the KDC.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote network access to the KDC service.

**Additional Details (Beyond the Initial CVE Description)**

*   The document provides detailed patch information, including specific code changes to address the vulnerabilities for different versions (krb5-1.0.x, krb5-1.1.1, MIT Kerberos 4 Patch 10, and CNS).
*   It explicitly states that the krb_rd_req() vulnerability was previously announced and that these vulnerabilities are in addition to that one.
*   The document lists vulnerable and non-vulnerable distributions of Kerberos.
*   It also acknowledges the people who helped to identify and resolve this vulnerability.

**Summary of Patches:**
The patches generally perform the following:

*   Use `memcpy` and null termination instead of `strcpy` for copying realm names, enforcing a size limit.
*   Set the `mbz` field to 0 in relevant data structures.
*   Add length checks on the various fields being processed.
*   Set pointers to safe default values in case of errors during request processing.
*   Use `strncat` instead of `strcat` for string concatenation operations.
*   Use `strncpy` to copy realm names and null-terminate the string.
*   Add checks and logging for malformed realm names, ticket or request IDs.
*   Set pointers to `0` after freeing to avoid double frees.
