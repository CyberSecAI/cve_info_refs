- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in the validation portion of the Local Procedure Call (LPC) Ports API function that allows a server thread to impersonate a client thread. This flaw allows a malicious user to create both client and server threads and manipulate the impersonation request to run in the context of any desired user on the local machine, including the System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insufficient validation of impersonation requests in the LPC Ports API.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can gain additional privileges on the local machine, potentially becoming an administrator. It could also be used to cause audit logs to indicate that certain actions were taken by another user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user who can log onto the target machine interactively and run arbitrary programs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to log onto the target machine interactively and run arbitrary programs.
