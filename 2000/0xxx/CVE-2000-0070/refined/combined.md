Published: January 13, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** January 12, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® 4.0. The vulnerability could allow a user logged onto a Windows NT 4.0 machine from the keyboard to become an administrator on the machine.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-003.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-003)

### General Information

## Issue

LPC Ports is a facility that allows LPC calls on a machine. One of the functions in the LPC Ports API set enables, by design, a server thread to impersonate a client thread on the same machine. However, a flaw in the validation portion of the function would allow a malicious user to create both the client and server threads, and manipulate the impersonation request to allow it to run in the context of any desired user on the local machine, including the System itself.

The primary risk from this vulnerability is that a malicious user could exploit this vulnerability to gain additional privileges on the local machine. However, it also could be used to cause audit logs to indicate that certain actions were taken by another user. A malicious user would require the ability to log onto the target machine interactively and run arbitrary programs in order to exploit this vulnerability, and as a result, workstations and terminal servers would be at greatest risk.
