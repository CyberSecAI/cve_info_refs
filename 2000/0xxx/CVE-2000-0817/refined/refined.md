- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unchecked buffers in several protocol parsers of the Network Monitor (Netmon) tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the protocol parsers do not properly validate the size of data in a frame before attempting to process it.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS): A malformed frame with random data could cause Netmon to fail (crash).
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE): A specially-crafted malformed frame could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the administrator's machine with the same privileges as the Netmon process, typically administrator level. If the administrator is a domain administrator, the attacker could potentially gain complete control over the entire domain.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  A malicious user can send a malformed network frame over a network segment that an administrator is monitoring.
    - For Netmon Lite, the malicious user needs to send the data directly to the specific machine running Netmon.
    - For the full version of Netmon, the malicious user only needs to send the malformed frame to an address on the same network segment or to a machine on which a remote agent is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to send network traffic to the target machine or the network segment being monitored.
    - For full version of Netmon, the attacker needs to know if the administrator is monitoring the network segment by either sending a malicious multicast packet or determine if any other machines are running Netmon Lite using queries.
