- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Passwords used for Data Transformation Service (DTS) packages and within the Registered Servers dialog in Enterprise Manager in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 are not adequately protected. They are masked by asterisks when displayed but can be programmatically retrieved in plaintext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The password can be retrieved by programmatically interrogating the package's Properties dialog.
    - The Registered Servers dialog within Enterprise Manager is also vulnerable to the same issue.
    - Passwords are not securely stored or protected, allowing for retrieval when displayed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow a malicious user to compromise account passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** 
    - A malicious user could programmatically interrogate the properties page of a DTS package.
    - The same attack vector can be used against the Registered Servers dialog through Enterprise Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the DTS package or Enterprise Manager Server Registration dialog.
    - The attacker needs the ability to view the Properties page or Registered Servers dialog.
    - The attacker needs to be able to programmatically interrogate the password edit box.
- **Additional details:** The vulnerability only exists if best practices are not followed such as using Windows Authentication instead of storing passwords within DTS packages or when registering a SQL server through Enterprise Manager. The DTS package creator must have chosen to supply a username and password instead of using Windows Authentication, and the DTS package was created without restricting who can edit it. The SQL Server administrator also has to allow Guest access to the SQL Server MSDB database.
