# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-023 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Myriad Escaped Characters" Vulnerability

Published: April 12, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** April 12, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Information Server. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to slow a web server's response or prevent it from providing service altogether for a period of time.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-023.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-023)

### General Information

## Issue

Special characters can be embedded in URLs by use of so-called escaped character sequences. By providing a specially-malformed URL with an extremely large number of escaped characters, a malicious user could arbitrarily increase the work factor associated with parsing the escaped characters, thereby consuming much or all of the CPU availability on the server and preventing useful work from being done.

The vulnerability does not provide any capability to cause the server to fail, or to add, change or delete data on it. The slowdown would only last until the URL had been processed, at which point service would return to normal.

* Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0
