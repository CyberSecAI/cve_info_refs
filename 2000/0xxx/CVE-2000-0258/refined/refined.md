- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) handles URLs containing a large number of escaped character sequences.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to inefficient parsing of escaped character sequences within URLs. By crafting a specially malformed URL with an extremely high number of escaped characters, an attacker could force the server to perform a large amount of processing, leading to high CPU usage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by consuming a significant portion or all of the CPU resources, slowing down the server's response or preventing it from providing service. The impact is temporary, service returns to normal after the malicious URL is processed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing numerous escaped character sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests with crafted URLs to the affected IIS server.
