This document describes multiple vulnerabilities, and CVE-2000-0302 specifically refers to a variant of the "Malformed Hit-Highlighting Argument" vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**
A vulnerability exists in the ISAPI filter responsible for hit-highlighting functionality (WebHits). This filter does not adequately validate file requests when processing hit-highlighting arguments.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The ISAPI filter fails to properly constrain the files that can be requested. A malformed argument can be crafted to escape the intended virtual directory path.
- **Path Traversal:** By providing a deliberately malformed argument, attackers can traverse the file system beyond the web root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can potentially retrieve any file on the server that resides on the same logical drive as the web root directory, regardless of file permissions.
- **Source Code Disclosure (Specific Variant):** A later variant of the vulnerability (CVE-2000-0302) could enable attackers to read the source code of server-side files, such as .ASP files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers manipulate the hit-highlighting argument within an HTTP request to the Index Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must have knowledge of the specific method for crafting malformed hit-highlighting arguments to exploit the vulnerability.
