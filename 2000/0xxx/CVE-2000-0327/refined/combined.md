# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-045 - Critical

## Patch Available "Virtual Machine Verifier" Vulnerability

Updated: July 01, 2009

**Version:** 3.0

**Patch Availability Information Updated:** July 1, 2009

**Originally Posted:** October 21, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a new version of the MicrosoftÂ® virtual machine (Microsoft VM) that eliminates a security vulnerability that could allow a Java applet to take unauthorized actions on the computer of a web site visitor. Although no standard Java compiler can generate such an applet, a Java applet constructed by hand with a Java bytecode assembler could bypass the sandbox and take virtually any action on the computer that the user would be capable of taking.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-045.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-045).

**Issue**

The Microsoft VM is a virtual machine for the Win32Â® operating environment. It runs atop Microsoft WindowsÂ® 95, 98 or Windows NTÂ®. It ships as part of each operating system, and also as part of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

The version of the Microsoft VM that ships with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and Internet Explorer 5.0 contains a security vulnerability in the bytecode verifier that could allow a Java applet to operate outside the bounds set by the sandbox. If hosted on a web site, it could cause any action to be taken on the computer of a visiting user that the user himself could take. This could include, for example, creating, deleting or modifying files, sending data to or receiving data from a web site, or reformatting the hard drive.

**Affected Software Versions**

Versions of the Microsoft VM are identified by build numbers, which can be determined using the JVIEW tool, as discussed in the FAQ. The following builds of the Microsoft VM are affected:

* All builds in the 2000 series prior to but not including build 2442
* All builds in the 3000 series prior to but not including build 3188

  **Note**    The Microsoft VM ships as part of several products. However, the primary ship vehicle is Internet Explorer. IE 4 ships with builds in the 2000 series; IE 5 ships with builds in the 3000 series.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0327](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0327)
