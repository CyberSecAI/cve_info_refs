- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A security vulnerability exists in the bytecode verifier of the Microsoft Virtual Machine (VM). This vulnerability allows a specially crafted Java applet to bypass the sandbox environment.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the flawed bytecode verification process within the Microsoft VM. The sandbox is intended to restrict the actions of applets to prevent malicious behavior, but this flaw allows a Java applet to operate outside of those bounds, potentially executing arbitrary code.

- **Impact of exploitation**: If exploited, a Java applet could take unauthorized actions on the computer of a web site visitor. This could include creating, deleting, or modifying files, sending or receiving data from a web site, and even reformatting the hard drive. Essentially, the attacker could perform any action that the user themselves could perform.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a specially crafted Java applet, hosted on a website, that a user visits with a vulnerable version of Microsoft VM. The user does not have to download or install the applet, as it would run automatically.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious Java applet, using a Java bytecode assembler. The applet must be hosted on a website accessible to the victim user.
