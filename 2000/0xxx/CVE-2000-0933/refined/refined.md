- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simplified Chinese Input Method Editor (IME) in Windows 2000 does not correctly recognize when it is running in the LocalSystem context (e.g., at the logon screen) and exposes inappropriate functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect state recognition by the Simplified Chinese IME, leading to the exposure of privileged functions when running in the LocalSystem context.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can gain complete control of the affected machine, including the ability to run arbitrary code, change system configurations, create new users, modify data, and more. This results in a privilege elevation from no access to LocalSystem.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Physical access to the machine's keyboard.
    - Ability to start a Terminal Server session on the affected machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs either physical access to the machineâ€™s keyboard or the ability to establish a terminal server connection.
    - The vulnerability is present by default on systems running the Simplified Chinese version of Windows 2000. For other language versions, the vulnerability is present only if a simplified Chinese IME was installed during system setup.
