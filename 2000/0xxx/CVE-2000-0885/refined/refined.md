- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unchecked buffers in several protocol parsers of the Network Monitor (Netmon) tool.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in Netmon's protocol parsers.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can cause Netmon to fail or execute arbitrary code on the administrator's machine, gaining local administrator privileges. If the administrator is a domain admin, this could lead to complete domain control.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially-crafted, malformed network frame to a server that is monitoring network traffic and has an administrator that will parse the data with a vulnerable parser. For Netmon Lite, the frame needs to be sent directly to the machine running Netmon. For the full version of Netmon, the frame can be sent to any machine on the local network segment or to a machine with a remote agent installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the targeted machine or network segment and needs to know when the administrator is capturing network data using Netmon.
