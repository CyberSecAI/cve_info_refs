# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-030 - Critical

## Updated Patch Available for Office "ODBC Vulnerabilities"

Published: August 20, 1999 | Updated: October 08, 1999

**Version:** 1.2

**Originally Posted:** August 20, 1999

**Revised:** August 23,

**Re-released:** October 08, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released an updated patch that eliminates security vulnerabilities in the MicrosoftÂ® Jet database engine. A patch originally was released in August 1999, but an additional variant of one vulnerability, the "Text I-ISAM" vulnerability, was subsequently discovered. The new variant could allow a database query to delete files on a user's computer.

The vulnerabilities in total could affect any application that runs atop Jet, and could allow a database query to take virtually any action on a user's computer. Microsoft recommends that all customers who are running applications that use Jet, especially users of Microsoft Office 97 and Office 2000, install the patch. Customers who applied the original patch should apply the new one to ensure that they are fully protected against all variants. Customers who did not previously apply the patch need only apply the new version.

Additional information and frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq99-030.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-030)

**Issue**

Jet is a database engine used by Microsoft products such as Microsoft Office97 and Office2000. Two vulnerabilities exist in Jet:

* The "VBA Shell" vulnerability, which affects all versions of Jet except Jet 4.0. An operating system command embedded within a database query could be executed when the query is processed. This would allow a spreadsheet, database, or other application file that contained such a query to take virtually any action on the user's computer when the query was executed.
* The "Text I-ISAM" vulnerability, which affects all versions of Jet. Jet provides a way to modify the contents of text files, as a way of allowing data exchange between it and other systems. However, a malicious user could use this capability to modify system files via a database query. The original patch for this vulnerability allowed "drop table" operations to be used, which could allow files on the user's computer to be deleted; the new patch eliminates this variant.

Microsoft Office uses the Jet engine, and Office users are particularly at risk from these vulnerabilities. (The "VBA Shell" vulnerability affects all versions of Office prior to Office2000, and also affects one member of the Office2000 suite, Access2000. The "Text I-ISAM" vulnerability affects all versions of Office). The vulnerabilities are an especially serious threat to Office users for three reasons:

* Scenarios for exploiting these vulnerabilities via Office documents are publicly known.
* The ubiquity of Office would make it an attractive target for mounting attacks via these vulnerabilities.
* The ability of Office documents to perform Document Object Hosting would permit users to be attacked simply by visiting a malicious user's web site.

Microsoft Jet also is used by several other Microsoft products, as well as many third party applications. However, the ability to exploit this vulnerability through these products is highly dependent on the specific application. Although Microsoft has not identified a means of exploiting these vulnerabilities through any Microsoft products except Office, we recommend that all customers who have Microsoft Jet installed on their computer update it. This will ensure that they are protected against any possible attacks that may be developed.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Jet, all versions

  **Note** Jet serves as the database engine for a number of Microsoft products, including but not limited to:
* Microsoft Office
* Microsoft Visual Studio
* Microsoft Publisher
* Microsoft Streets & Trips

**Vulnerability Identifiers**

* VBA Shell Vulnerability: [CAN-2000-0325](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=can-2000-0325)
* Text I-ISAM Vulnerability: [CVE-2000-0323](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0323)

Jet also serves as the database engine for many third-party software products. The patch does not require any change to any of the applications that use Jet; instead, it operates directly on the Jet database engine and restores proper functionality to it.

**Patch Availability**

* [https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?FamilyID=3EFBE71A-00BB-48CE-930A-47FB9827E1E7&displaylang;=en](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=3efbe71a-00bb-48ce-930a-47fb9827e1e7&displaylang;=en)

**Notes**

* The above web site provides separate pages for Office97 and Office2000. This is done in order to provide specific information about the vulnerabilities affecting the products. The patch for Office97 and Office2000 (and indeed for all affected products) is exactly the same, and both pages link to exactly the same patch. The patch will determine what version(s) of Jet are present on the machine and apply all of the needed corrections.
* The patch is suitable for use by all language packs.
* The patch applies to Jet 3.5 and all subsequent versions. Older versions of Jet are no longer supported, and we recommend that affected customers upgrade to a supported version.
* The patch is suitable for widespread deployment via MicrosoftÂ® Systems Management ServerÂ®. Users who wish to manually apply patches for specific versions of Jet should consult the [FAQ](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-030) for information on how to do this.

A vulnerability has been found that allows a remote attacker to traverse the server's file system outside the document root by issuing GET requests with '../' in them. This could allow any file to be remotely read by an attacker. If directory browsing is enabled, the attacker doesn't need prior knowledge of file names to exploit this flaw.

The Intelligent Agent is also installed setuid root by default. Attackers may manipulate these environment variables to create root owned files that will follow symbolic links.  Reference: ISS Security Advisory: "Root Compromise Vulnerabilities in Oracle 8" at: [http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise35.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20000819203059/http%3A//xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise35.php)  - -----  Date Reported:		1999-08-23 Vulnerability:		oracle-dbsnmp-trace Platforms Affected:	Oracle (8.x) Risk Factor:		High Attack Type:		Host Based  Oracle can be tricked into reading rogue configuration files via trusted environment variables.  'dbsnmp' then opens a 'trace' file that is owned by root and created with mode 666.  This file can be linked out. Another vulnerability again depends on trusted environment variables.  'dbsnmp' will execute rogue TCL scripts if environment variables are manipulated correctly.

It has functionality called Text I-ISAM that allows the Jet driver to write to a text file.  A malicious user could exploit a vulnerability in Text I-ISAM and write to system files by performing a database query.  Reference: Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS99-030): "Patch Available for Office 'ODBC Vulnerabilities'" at: [http://www.microsoft.com/Security/Bulletins/ms99-030.asp](https://web.archive.org/web/20000819203059/http%3A//www.microsoft.com/Security/Bulletins/ms99-030.asp)  - -----  Date Reported:		1999-08-20 Vulnerability:		jet-vba-shell Platforms Affected:	Microsoft Jet (3.5, 3.5.1) Risk Factor:		High Attack Type:		Network/Host Based  Microsoft Jet is a database engine used in programs such as Office 97 and Office 2000.  Microsoft Jet contains a vulnerability that could allow an operating system command to be executed from a database query.  Once the query is executed from a spreadsheet or program, then a user could execute virtually anything on the affected machine.

This buffer overflow is related to the way that NLDAP handles the ldap_search request. By sending a large parameter in the ldap_search request, an attacker can cause a PANIC in the Domino server.  This allows an attacker to stop all Domino services running on the affected machine.  Reference: ISS Security Advisory: "Denial of Service Attack against Lotus Notes Domino Server 4.6" at: [http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise34.php](https://web.archive.org/web/20000819203059/http%3A//xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise34.php)  - -----  Date Reported:		1999-08-20 Vulnerability:		smtp-refuser-tmp Platforms Affected:	Linux: Debian Risk Factor:		Medium Attack Type:		Network/Host Based  The smtp-refuser package, installed on some versions of Debian Linux systems, creates a logging facility in the system "/tmp" directory. This facility is insecurely created and could allow a local attacker who has write access to "/tmp" to delete arbitrary, root-owned files on the system.  Reference: Debian Security Information: "smtp-refuser: /tmp file creation problem" at: [http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990823b](https://web.archive.org/web/20000819203059/http%3A//www.debian.org/security/1999/19990823b)  - -----  Date Reported:		1999-08-19 Vulnerability:		ciscosecure-read-write Platforms Affected:	CiscoSecure Risk Factor:		High Attack Type:		Network/Host Based  A vulnerability in CiscoSecure ACS version 1.0 through 2.3.2 for Unix allows a remote attacker to read and write to the server database without authentication. The attacker could modify access policies, add and delete accounts, or elevate access privileges for accounts.  CiscoSecure ACS for Windows NT is not vulnerable to this problem.  Reference: Cisco Field Notice: "CiscoSecure Access Control Server for UNIX Remote Administration Vulnerability" at: [http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/770/csecure-dbaccess.shtml](https://web.archive.org/web/20000819203059/http%3A//www.cisco.com/warp/public/770/csecure-dbaccess.shtml)  - -----  Date Reported:		1999-08-19 Vulnerability:		linux-telnetd-term Platforms Affected:	Linux: Red Hat (4.2, 5.2, 6.0) Risk Factor:		Medium Attack Type:		Network/Host Based  The telnetd server and libncurses library of some Linux systems, notably Red Hat and Caldera, could allow a remote or local attacker to cause the system to crash or hang. By specifying a malformed terminal when connecting to a vulnerable system's telnet server, the daemon could possibly attempt to read files that would cause a denial of service by crashing the system. This same attack can be exploited by local attackers, giving bad terminal information to setuid programs linked against a vulnerable libncurses library.  References: Red Hat, Inc.
