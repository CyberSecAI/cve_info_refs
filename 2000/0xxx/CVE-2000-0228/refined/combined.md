## Patch Available for "Malformed Media License Request" Vulnerability

Published: March 17, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** March 17, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a denial of service vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Windows Mediaâ¢ License Manager. The vulnerability could allow a malicious user to temporarily prevent the license server from issuing further licenses to customers for protected digital content (music and video).

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-016.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-016).

### General Information

## Issue

Windows Media License Manager is part of Windows Media Rights Manager, a component of Windows Media Technologies that enables content providers to distribute copyrighted digital media in encrypted form. When Windows Media Player opens protected digital media, it contacts the provider's server, presents the user's license request information, and obtains a license that allows it to play the media. However, a specially-malformed license request can cause License Manager to halt, thereby preventing legitimate subscribers from obtaining a license for the same or other content hosted at this site.

The vulnerability does not in any way compromise the protection provided by the encryption or prevent offline playing of content that the user has already licensed. The server can be put back into normal operation by restarting the License Manager.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Windows Media Rights Manager 1.0.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0228](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0228)
