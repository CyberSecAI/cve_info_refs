- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specially-malformed license request sent to the Windows Media License Manager can cause it to halt.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). The License Manager is susceptible to crashing when processing malformed license requests.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation temporarily prevents the license server from issuing licenses to customers for protected digital content (music and video), effectively halting access to such content. Legitimate users are unable to obtain licenses until the License Manager is restarted.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malformed license request sent to the Windows Media License Manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to send a malformed license request to the Windows Media License Manager.
