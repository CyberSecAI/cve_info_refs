- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A malformed client request can induce a race condition in the Windows Media Unicast Service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition vulnerability. The service enters a state where subsequent requests can cause it to fail.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service. The Windows Media Unicast Service fails, interrupting any ongoing sessions and preventing the server from providing on-demand streaming media until restarted.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specific type of malformed request to a Windows Media server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Windows Media server. This can be done remotely if the server is exposed to the Internet or internally if on a local network. The attacker does not need any privileges to perform this attack.
