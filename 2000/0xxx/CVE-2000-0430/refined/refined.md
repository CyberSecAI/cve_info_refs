- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cart32 e-commerce application exposes a debugging page when a specific command (`/expdate`) is appended to the `cart32.exe` URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application fails to properly handle the `/expdate` command, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information through a debugging page. The debugging page displays server variables, contents of the Cart32 administration directory, and potentially the contents of the cgi-bin directory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gather sensitive information about the server and the application, potentially including customer databases, if they are improperly stored in the cgi-bin directory. This information can be used for further attacks or to compromise sensitive customer data.
- **Attack vectors:**  By appending `/expdate` to the `cart32.exe` URL in a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to access the web server hosting the vulnerable Cart32 installation. No authentication is required.
