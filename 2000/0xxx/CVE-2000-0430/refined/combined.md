Another interesting Cart32 command

example:   <http://example.com/cgi-bin/cart32.exe/expdate>

This causes an error and displays a debugging page with server variables,
 the
contents of the Cart32 administration directory and sometimes, the contents
of cgi-bin.
This makes it easy to spot misconfigured Cart32 installs (customer databases
installed to the cgi-bin directory.)

You could fix this one in a hexeditor by changing the /EXPDATE string to
something random.

/fx7#d@+  <--- free pseudo-random string
