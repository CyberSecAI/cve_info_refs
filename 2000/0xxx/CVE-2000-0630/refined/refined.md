Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the "Absent Directory Browser Argument" vulnerability (CVE-2000-0630) as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-044:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An administrative script, part of IIS 3.0 but preserved on upgrade to IIS 4.0 or 5.0, does not properly handle cases where an expected argument is missing. This leads to an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Infinite Loop:** The script, when called without a specific argument, enters an infinite loop, consuming all server CPU resources.
2.  **Inappropriate Permissions:**  Permissions on the vulnerable script and related tools are too permissive. These scripts were designed for local execution in IIS 3.0 but can be accessed remotely in IIS 4.0 and 5.0 due to a lack of proper access controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The infinite loop caused by the missing argument makes the web server unresponsive to requests.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Due to the inappropriate permissions on these tools, unauthorized users can view the directory structure of the server. This does not allow adding, changing, or deleting files, but can provide useful information for further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specific request to the vulnerable script, but without the required argument.
- Accessing the script through a web browser due to the lack of proper access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable script.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated, due to the insufficient access controls on the script.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability only affects systems that have been upgraded from IIS 3.0 to IIS 4.0 or 5.0. Fresh installations of IIS 4.0 or 5.0 are not affected by the infinite loop issue. However, the inappropriate permissions issue affects all installations of IIS 4.0 and 5.0 with the HTR script mapping enabled.
- The recommended mitigation is to remove the HTR script mapping, which disables the vulnerable functionality.
- Microsoft has a patch to address this issue, and also recommends strengthening the access controls for the /scripts/iisadmin directory even after applying the patch.
