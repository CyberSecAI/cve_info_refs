- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that .ASP pages in IIS do not support the creation of secure Session ID cookies as defined in RFC 2109. This results in secure and non-secure pages on the same website using the same Session ID.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of support for marking Session ID cookies as "secure" in .ASP pages. This allows Session ID cookies to be transmitted in plaintext when a user navigates from a secure (HTTPS) page to a non-secure (HTTP) page on the same site.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with complete control over a victim's network communications can intercept the plaintext Session ID cookie when the victim accesses a non-secure page, and use it to hijack the victim's secure session. This would allow the attacker to take any action on the secure page that the victim is authorized to take, potentially including viewing personal information, placing orders, or making changes to the user's account.

- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to be in a position to monitor all communications between the victim and the webserver. This can be achieved through physical access to the victim's network connection, or by being on a network segment through which the victim's data passes.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to:
    - Monitor all network communications between the victim and the web server.
    - Intercept and read plaintext data transmitted over HTTP.
    - Initiate a new connection to the secure page using the victim's stolen Session ID.
    The attacker also needs to be able to make the victim visit a non-secure page on the website after they have visited a secure page to gain access to the session id.
