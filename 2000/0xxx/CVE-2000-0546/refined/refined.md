Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** A static buffer within the Kerberos 4 KDC process can be overrun by sending specially crafted, corrupt requests.
*   **Double Free:** In Kerberos 5 (krb5-1.1.x and krb5-1.2-beta1) KDCs, a memory management bug in the Kerberos 4 compatibility code can lead to a double-free of memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Bounds Checking:** The KDC software does not properly check the length of input data before copying it into fixed-size buffers, leading to buffer overflows. Specifically, the length of the realm name and other request data is not validated against the buffer size.
*   **Memory Management Error:** The krb5-1.1.x KDC's Kerberos 4 compatibility code contains a flaw that can cause a double free due to improper memory deallocation.
*  **Lack of Input Sanitization**: Input strings from the network are not validated and can lead to buffer overflows, even if they are null-terminated, if they exceed the buffer size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   The buffer overflow can corrupt the KDC's internal state, potentially causing it to issue bogus tickets or return "principal unknown" errors, effectively halting normal operation until the service is restarted.
    *   The double-free vulnerability can crash the KDC process due to segmentation violations or heap corruption.
*   **KDC Instability:** The KDC can become unstable requiring a restart for normal operation.
*   **Potentially Bogus Tickets:** An attacker may be able to cause the KDC to issue invalid tickets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Requests:** Both vulnerabilities are triggered by sending malicious requests to the KDC over the network. Specifically, the buffer overflow is caused by corrupt requests to the KDC process. The double-free is triggered by requests that use the Kerberos 4 compatibility mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the KDC. This could be from within the same network or, in some cases, from a remote location.
*   **Knowledge of Protocol:** The attacker must have some knowledge of the Kerberos protocol to craft malicious requests that trigger these vulnerabilities.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerabilities are triggered before authentication, hence no prior access to the KDC is necessary.

**Additional details:**

* The advisory provides patches for the identified vulnerabilities in the KDC implementations.
* Patches address issues in multiple Kerberos versions including MIT Kerberos 5 releases krb5-1.0.x, krb5-1.1, krb5-1.1.1, MIT Kerberos 4 patch 10, KerbNet, Cygnus Network Security (CNS), and KTH-krb4.
