Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- When a virtual directory on an IIS server is mapped to a UNC share, and a request for a file in that directory includes certain characters at the end of the URL, the ISAPI extension processing may fail to occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of specific trailing characters in a URL request when the virtual directory is mapped to a UNC share.
- Failure to properly invoke the ISAPI extension, leading to source code exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The server sends the source code of .ASP files (and potentially other files) to the client instead of executing them, which may reveal sensitive information within the code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the web server with specific characters appended at the end of the URL when the target file resides in a virtual directory mapped to a UNC share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable IIS server.
- The attacker needs to know, or be able to guess, the location of virtual directories that are mapped to UNC shares.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the name of an affected file, such as an .ASP file.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is made more difficult to exploit by the fact that virtual directories are designed to hide actual file locations, and some browsers may correct the malformed requests.
- It is emphasized that sensitive information should not be stored in files that require server-side processing (e.g. .ASP).
- The vulnerability affects Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 and 5.0, along with other related products like Microsoft Proxy Server, Site Server, and Commercial Internet System.
