# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-019 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Virtualized UNC Share" Vulnerability

Published: March 30, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** March 30, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Information Server and products based on it. Under certain fairly unusual conditions, the vulnerability could cause a web server to send the source code of .ASP and other files to a visiting user.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-019.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-019)

### General Information

## Issue

If a virtual directory on an IIS server is mapped to a UNC share, and a request for a file in the directory contains one of several particular characters at the end, the expected ISAPI extension processing may not occur. The result is that the source code of the file would be sent to the browser.

There are significant restrictions that would increase the difficulty of exploiting this vulnerability:

* By design, virtual directories hide the actual location of files. Under most circumstances, there would be no way for an attacker to determine which files on a server actually reside on a UNC share.
* Many browsers will "correct" requests that contain the trailing characters at issue here, by either removing the characters or changing them.
* If recommended security practices are followed, .ASP and other files that require server-side processing will not contain any sensitive information to compromise.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 and 5.0
* Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0
* Microsoft Site Server and Site Server, Commerce Edition 3.0
* Microsoft Commercial Internet System 2.0 and 2.5

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0246](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0246)
