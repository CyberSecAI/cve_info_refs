- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Undelimited .HTR Request" vulnerability is caused by a missing delimiter in a password change request within the ISAPI extension that provides web-based password administration via .HTR scripts. This missing delimiter causes an unbounded search in the algorithm.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is a denial-of-service issue that arises from an unbounded search when processing a malformed .HTR request.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Exploitation can lead to the inability to service additional .HTR requests, and it can slow down the server's overall response.
- **Attack vectors**:  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted password change request missing an expected delimiter to the affected server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send web requests to the affected server.
