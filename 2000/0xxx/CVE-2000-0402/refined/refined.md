CVE-2000-0402
```

- **Root Cause:** When SQL Server 7.0 Service Packs 1, 2, or 3 are installed on a machine configured to perform authentication using Mixed Mode, the password for the SQL Server System Administrator (sa) account is recorded in plaintext in the files `%TEMP%\sqlsp.log` and `%WINNT%\setup.iss`.
- **Vulnerability:** The default permissions on the log files allow any user who can log onto the server interactively to read them.
- **Impact:** A malicious user could recover the password and use it to gain administrative control over the database.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker with interactive logon access to the SQL server can read the plaintext password from the log files.
- **Required Capabilities:**
  - The SQL Server must be configured in Mixed Mode.
  - The administrator must have chosen to use SQL Server Authentication during the service pack installation.
  - The attacker needs to be able to log onto the server interactively.
