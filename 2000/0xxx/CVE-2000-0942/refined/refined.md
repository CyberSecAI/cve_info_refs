- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Indexing Service component (CiWebHitsFile) does not properly validate inputs before using them in dynamic web pages, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (CSS). Specifically, when called from a specially crafted URL, the component fails to filter out script code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (CSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the Indexing Service component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can inject and execute arbitrary script code on a victim's machine, using the trust relationship of a third-party website. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on the user's computer with the permissions granted to the third-party site, potentially leading to persistent code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user lures a victim to their site and then redirects the victim to a vulnerable third-party website with a crafted URL containing malicious script. This is often achieved by the victim clicking a malicious hyperlink.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a malicious website to host the initial attack and the ability to craft a URL with malicious script to target the vulnerable third-party website. The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable server.
