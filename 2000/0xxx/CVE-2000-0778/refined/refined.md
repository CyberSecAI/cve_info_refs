- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A specialized header combined with specific characters at the end of a file request can bypass the intended ISAPI extension processing in IIS. This results in the server sending the raw source code of the requested file instead of processing it.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of file requests with specialized headers and specific trailing characters, which leads to bypassing the scripting engine for advanced file types like .ASP and .HTR.

- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is the potential exposure of sensitive information contained within web files (e.g., passwords or other data embedded in .ASP files). An attacker could obtain the source code of such files, potentially compromising sensitive data.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires crafting a specific HTTP request that includes a "specialized header" and particular characters at the end of the request. This cannot be done through standard browsers, implying the need for alternative tools or custom scripts.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to create and send custom HTTP requests with specialized headers. They do not need to be in a privileged position on the server but do need network access to the vulnerable IIS server.
