Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described in the advisory:

**1. Buffer Overrun in Kerberos 4 KDC:**

*   **Root Cause:** A static buffer within the Kerberos 4 KDC process can be overflowed by sending specially crafted, corrupt requests.
*   **Weakness:** Insufficient bounds checking when processing incoming requests allows writing past the allocated buffer.
*  **Impact:** While not believed to lead to root compromise, the buffer overrun can cause a denial of service (DoS) by corrupting the KDC's internal state. This might result in the KDC issuing bogus tickets or returning errors for all principals, requiring a restart of the KDC service.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A remote attacker can send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable KDC.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the KDC's port and craft a malicious Kerberos request.

**2. Double-Free Vulnerability in krb5-1.1.x KDC (Kerberos 4 compatibility code):**

*   **Root Cause:** A memory management bug in the Kerberos 4 compatibility code within the krb5-1.1.x KDC (and krb5-1.2-beta1) can lead to a double-free of memory.
*   **Weakness:** The code incorrectly manages memory allocation and deallocation during the processing of Kerberos 4 requests.
*   **Impact:** This double-free can lead to memory corruption within the malloc pool, causing the KDC process to crash. The actual crash is dependent on the specific malloc implementation used.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can send a crafted Kerberos 4 request to trigger the vulnerable code path in the KDC's Kerberos 4 compatibility mode.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the KDC's port and craft a malicious Kerberos 4 request that triggers the flawed Kerberos 4 compatibility code.

**Summary of Patches:**

The advisory includes detailed patches for the following distributions to address these vulnerabilities:

*   **MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5-1.0.x and krb5-1.1.x, including beta releases):**  Patches modify `kerberos_v4.c` to include bounds checking before copying data into buffers, prevent double frees of memory, and add more checks for various data lengths.
*  **KTH-krb4:**  The recommendation is to upgrade to 1.0.1 (or later).
*   **Cygnus Network Security (CNS):** Patches modify `kerberos.c` with length checks and add code to prevent buffer overflows when handling requests.
*   **MIT Kerberos 4 Patch 10:** Patches modify `kerberos.c` with similar length checks, buffer overflow prevention, and proper memory handling.
*   **krb5/src/lib/krb5/krb/kfree.c**: The patch prevents double-frees by clearing pointers after freeing them.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory explicitly states that the `krb_rd_req()` vulnerability was previously announced. The patches also address this.
*   The patches provided focus on preventing buffer overflows, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   The advisory acknowledges the contributions of various individuals and organizations in identifying and addressing these security issues.
*   The advisory recommends that users immediately patch their KDC installations.
* The advisory clarifies that while previous beta patch releases attempted to fix krb4 buffer overrun, this vulnerability required new patches.
* The patches address issues with `strcat` in error message generation, replacing them with `strncat` to prevent overflow.
