THE PURPOSE OF THIS HOTFIX
ISSUE #1
This HotFix resolves a buffer overflow problem in an OEM version
of software incorporated within the Net Tools PKI Server product.
Without this HotFix installed, users using long invalid filenames
within HTTP requests could cause a buffer overflow in the error
logging function of the Web server incorporated within the Net
Tools PKI. This can result in the Net Tools PKI Web Server
service crashing and--potentially--data being overwritten on
the stack of the host computer.
To determine whether anyone has attempted to exploit this
vulnerability, check the enroll-access.log and the
admin-access.log files in the WebServer/logs directory of your
Net Tools PKI Server installation. Search for any log entries
which are excessively long (greater than 500 characters). Each
log entry can then be examined to see the IP address of
the computer that submitted the request.
ISSUE #2
This HotFix resolves a Web server directory traversal problem in
an OEM version of software incorporated within the Net Tools PKI
Server product.
Without this HotFix installed, directory traversal was not
disabled within the Web server incorporated within the Net Tools
PKI. This can result in unauthorized access to files on the host
computer outside of the Web server root directory. Knowledge
of the directory structure is required to access specific files.
Access is limited to files which are readable by the user that
the Enrollment and/or Administration Web server runs under.
To determine whether anyone has attempted to exploit this
vulnerability, check the enroll-access.log and the
admin-access.log files in the WebServer/logs directory of your
Net Tools PKI Server installation. Search for any log entries
containing "..\" within them. Each log entry can then be examined
to see the IP address of the computer that submitted the request.
ISSUE #3
This HotFix resolves a URL validation and Web Server crashing
problem in an OEM version of software incorporated within the
Net Tools PKI Server product.
This HotFix resolves a problem with validating string formatting
of user supplied data. The Web Server component of the Net Tools
PKI Server failed to properly validate data passed as arguments
to the server's logging routines. Passing certain strings could
cause the Web Server to crash and potentially cause arbitrary
code to run as the user account that the Web Server component
is running as on the host computer.
ISSUE #4
This HotFix resolves a URL validation problem in an OEM version
of software incorporated within the Net Tools PKI Server product.
This HotFix resolves a problem where it was possible to obtain
a directory listing for system or web server directories by
requesting URLs containing characters such as double quote ("),
less than (<), and greater than (>), which are illegal in Win32
file names.
To determine whether anyone has attempted to exploit this
vulnerability, check the enroll-access.log and the admin-access.log
files in the WebServer/logs directory of your Net Tools PKI Server
installation. Search for any log entries with URLs containing the
characters mentioned above within them. Each log entry can then be
examined to see the IP address of the computer that submitted
the request.
ISSUE #5
This HotFix resolves web server crashing problem in an OEM version
of software incorporated within the Net Tools PKI Server product.
Without this HotFix installed, it is possible to crash the Web
server component of the Net Tools PKI when requesting certain URLs.
It was possible to cause the web server to crash by requesting URLs
of the form /~username/, or by requesting a URL containing escaped
characters outside of the normal ASCII range of 32-127.
