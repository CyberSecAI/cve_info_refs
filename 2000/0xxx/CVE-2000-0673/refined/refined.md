- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NetBIOS Name Server (NBNS) protocol, part of the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) family, is an unauthenticated protocol. This allows malicious users to misuse the Name Conflict and Name Release mechanisms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The NBNS protocol is unauthenticated, making it susceptible to spoofing. The Name Conflict and Name Release mechanisms can be exploited by an attacker to cause a machine to relinquish its name on the network.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The targeted machine would not respond to requests sent to the conflicted name, preventing other machines from accessing its services.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack involves sending spoofed Name Conflict or Name Release datagrams to a target machine via the NBNS protocol.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target machine or have the ability to send UDP packets to port 137 of the target machine. If port 137 UDP is blocked at the firewall, external attacks are not possible.
