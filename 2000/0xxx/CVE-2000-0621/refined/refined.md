Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2000-0621:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of an HTML email to bypass the intended cache mechanism and save files to a known location on the recipient's computer outside of the controlled cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cache Bypass:** HTML emails can bypass the Internet Explorer security architecture's cache mechanism, allowing them to create files in arbitrary locations.
*   **Incorrect Security Zone Assignment:** When HTML files are created outside of the cache, they are opened in the Local Computer Zone instead of the Internet Zone, which grants them excessive privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **File Reading:** Attackers can read files on the user's computer if they know the full path and filename, provided the file type can be opened in a browser (e.g., .txt, .jpg, .htm). The content of these files can then be sent to a malicious user's website.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** The ability to place files in known locations could enable attackers to place executable files on the victim's machine. While this vulnerability itself does not launch the executable, it sets the stage for a separate attack to achieve code execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By running HTML code from a file outside the cache, the code executes in the Local Computer Zone, gaining more privileges than intended.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML email, designed to exploit the cache bypass vulnerability.
*   **File Creation:** The malicious HTML email saves a file to the recipient's computer outside the designated cache location.
*   **File Opening:** The malicious email opens this newly created file, causing it to execute in the Local Computer Zone

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send HTML Emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails that include HTML content.
*   **Knowledge or Guessing of File Paths:** To read files, the attacker needs to know the full path and filenames of the targeted files on the victim's machine.
*   **Exploitation Knowledge:** The attacker needs to craft HTML code that can bypass the cache mechanism and save files to specific locations.
*   **Secondary Exploit for Code Execution:** If the attacker aims to execute arbitrary code, they need a separate method to launch the executable they placed on the system.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by a patch and is also addressed in later versions of Internet Explorer (IE 5.01 SP1 and IE 5.5).
*   The patch also eliminated vulnerabilities discussed in MS00-043 and MS00-045.
