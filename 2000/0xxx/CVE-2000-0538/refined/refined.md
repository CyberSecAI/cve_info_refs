- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how ColdFusion handles password parsing during authentication requests. Specifically, the process of converting the input and stored passwords into comparable forms becomes problematic when the input password is excessively large.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core vulnerability is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability due to inefficient processing of large input strings during password comparison, specifically when the input password exceeds 40,000 characters. This allows an attacker to cause resource exhaustion on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service, where the ColdFusion web server is overwhelmed and becomes unable to process legitimate web page requests. This can effectively halt the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the ColdFusion Administrator login page. An attacker can manipulate the HTML form of the login page by changing the field size and POST action to allow the submission of an oversized password string (over 40,000 characters).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to access the login page and modify the HTML form to inject the malicious input. This does not require any special privileges on the server or network level, and only requires the ability to access the login page, modify the page source, and submit the modified form.
