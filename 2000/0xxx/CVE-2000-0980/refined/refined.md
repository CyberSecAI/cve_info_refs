- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Microsoft IPX/SPX protocol implementation (NWLink) includes an NMPI (Name Management Protocol on IPX) listener that incorrectly handles malformed packets where the source network address is the same as the destination address, specifically a broadcast address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation in the NMPI listener, allowing it to process packets with invalid source network addresses. The NMPI listener responds to broadcast addresses when it receives a packet with a broadcast source address.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Sending a malformed NMPI packet can cause the affected machine to fail and trigger a broadcast storm on the network due to multiple machines responding to the broadcast address. The broadcast storm can lead to network congestion and make affected systems unusable.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a malformed NMPI packet with the source address set to a broadcast address to a vulnerable system. The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the targeted machines if they use a cable modem or DSL connection, or on the same intranet for a corporate setting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send IPX packets to the target network. They need to be on the same local network segment or have network access to the vulnerable machines. The attacker needs to have knowledge of IPX networking and the ability to craft a specific malformed NMPI packet.
