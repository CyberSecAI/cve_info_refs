# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-009 - Important

## Patch Available for "Image Source Redirect" Vulnerability

Published: February 16, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** February 16, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site operator to read - but not add, change or delete - certain types of files on the computer of a visiting user.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-009.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-009).

### General Information

## Issue

When a web server navigates a window from one domain into another one, the IE security model checks the server's permissions on the new page. However, it is possible for a web server to open a browser window to a client-local file, then navigate the window to a page that is in the web site's domain in such a way that the data in the client-local file is accessible to the new window. The data would only be accessible to the new window for a very brief period, but the result is that it could be possible for a malicious web site operator to view files on the computer of a visiting user. The web site operator would need to know (or guess) the name and location of the file, and could only view file types that can be opened in a browser window.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and 4.01.
* Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and 5.01.
