- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A flaw in how Internet Explorer handles navigation between domains and local files. When a web server navigates a window from one domain to another, the security model checks permissions. However, it's possible for a server to open a browser window to a client-local file, then navigate that window to a page within the server's domain, making the local file's data briefly accessible to the new window.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper security checks during window navigation between a client-local file and a web server domain, leading to unauthorized access to local files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious website operator could potentially view (but not modify) certain types of files on a user's computer if they know or guess the file's name and location. Only files that can be opened in a browser window are vulnerable.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious web server can exploit this by opening a browser window to a client-local file, and then navigating that window to a page in the attacker's domain.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker must operate a malicious website that the victim visits. The attacker also needs to know (or guess) the name and location of the local file, and the file type must be viewable within a browser window.
