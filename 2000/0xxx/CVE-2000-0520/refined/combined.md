| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=11880#c0)  SB    2000-06-03 03:35:39 UTC  ``` Here's the descrepency I noticed:  /usr/include/stdio.h: line 77: # define BUFSIZ _IO_BUFSIZ  /usr/include/libio.h: line 43: #define _IO_BUFSIZ _G_BUFSIZ  /usr/include/_G_config.h: line 85: #define _G_BUFSIZ 8192  /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/dump-0.4b15/compat/include/protocols/dumprestore.h: line 53: #define TP_BSIZE        1024  /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/dump-0.4b15/restore/restore.h: line 74: extern FILE        *terminal;  /usr/src/redhat/BUILD/dump-0.4b15/restore/tape.c: line 311:         char buf[TP_BSIZE]; line 357:                         (void) fgets(buf, BUFSIZ, terminal);  Now isn't putting potentially 8192 bytes of data in a 1024 byte variable a bit much?  Anyway, either change line 311 in tape.c to:         char buf[BUFSIZ]; or change line 357 of tape.c to:                         (void) fgets(buf, TP_BSIZE, terminal); I expect either one should do the job.  -Stan Bubrouski   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=11880#c1)  Stelian Pop    2000-06-03 22:30:09 UTC  ``` You are absolutely right. Thanks for the bug report.  Could you in the future send a copy of this kind of bug reports directly to the dump maintainer. It would be easier for me to get the patches... I know, it's the job of RedHat's guys but...  Stelian.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=11880#c2)  Preston Brown    2000-06-27 16:09:07 UTC  ``` fixed in rawhide.   ``` |  |
