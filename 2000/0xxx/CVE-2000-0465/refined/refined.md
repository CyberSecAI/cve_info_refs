The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is related to CVE-2000-0465.

**Vulnerability Details for CVE-2000-0465 (Frame Domain Verification):**

*   **Root Cause:**  Two functions within Internet Explorer did not properly perform domain checking when a web server opens a frame within a window. The IE security model is supposed to restrict access to data within a frame to the parent window only if they are in the same domain. Due to the flawed domain checking, a parent window could open a frame containing a local file and subsequently read its contents.
*   **Weakness:** Improper domain verification within specific IE functions.
*   **Impact:** A malicious website operator could potentially read local files on a visiting user's computer. The attacker would need to know or guess the name and location of the target file. Only file types viewable within a browser window are vulnerable to this attack.
*  **Attack Vector:** A malicious website can open a frame containing a local file and then read its content. This is done by exploiting the lack of proper domain checking when a web server opens a frame within a window.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker is a malicious website operator. They can exploit the vulnerability when a user visits their site. They need to know or guess the name and location of the file to be read by the frame.

The content also mentions two other vulnerabilities:
*   **CVE-2000-0439 (Unauthorized Cookie Access):** A specially crafted URL could allow a malicious website to access another site's cookies. The attacker would need to entice the user to click the crafted link.
*   **CVE-2000-0464 (Malformed Component Attribute):** An unchecked buffer in the code used to invoke ActiveX components could be exploited to run code on the user's computer. This is exposed when certain component attributes are specified together.

The bulletin notes that the patch for these vulnerabilities has been rolled into a subsequently released patch (MS00-055).
