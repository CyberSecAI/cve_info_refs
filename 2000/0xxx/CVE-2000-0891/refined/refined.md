{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Permissive default Execution Control Lists (ECLs) in Lotus Notes prior to version 5.02.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Default ECLs allowed any program, regardless of authorship, all 11 permissions.",
      "Lack of proper access control for execution of programs within Lotus Notes.",
      "Ability to attach programs to Notes forms which can be triggered upon events (e.g. opening a mail)."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can cause victims to execute arbitrary code simply by sending them a mail message, and the message need only be opened by the victim. The user would not be prompted to prevent the code from running.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malicious mail message with an attached program to a Notes user."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to create and send specially crafted Notes mail messages containing malicious programs."
  },
    "additional_details": {
        "solution": "The procedure to remediate this vulnerability involves changing the default ECLs to disallow execution of unsigned code and then adding specific users or developers to a list that allows them to execute code. The default settings have been fixed starting in Notes 5.0.2."
