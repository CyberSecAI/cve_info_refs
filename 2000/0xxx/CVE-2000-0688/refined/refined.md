The provided content describes a vulnerability in the "Subscribe Me" CGI script, specifically the LITE version.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to remotely alter the administrator password for the Subscribe Me Admin Control Panel. The script did not have a check in place to determine if the password file already existed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper password file existence check in the `setpwd` routine. This allows a remote user to overwrite the admin password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can gain administrative access to the Subscribe Me Admin Control Panel.
- Attackers can add/remove users from the subscription list.
- Attackers can send emails with a message body of their choice, potentially leading to spam or phishing attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote exploitation via a web request to the vulnerable CGI script.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable CGI script.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special privileges.

The provided content includes a patch that checks for the existence of the password file before attempting to create a new one. This patch prevents the overwriting of the password and mitigates the vulnerability.
