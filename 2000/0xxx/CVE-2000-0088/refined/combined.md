Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-002.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-002)

### General Information

## Issue

Microsoft Office includes a conversion utility that converts older Word documents to more recent formats. The conversion utility for Word 5 documents in East Asian languages (Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese) has an unchecked buffer. By using a hexadecimal editor to insert specially malformed information into a document, a malicious user could cause Word to run code of his or her choice when the document was opened using an affected version of the converter.

A Word 5 converter installs by default as part of Word and PowerPoint, and can be installed at user behest as part of a converter pack. However, the vulnerability affects only the East Asian language versions of the converter, and only the Windows versions of them. No other language versions of the converter are affected, and no version of the converter for Macintosh is affected.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Converter Pack 2000 for Windows
* Microsoft Office 2000 for Windows with Multilanguage pack
