Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-0024:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Microsoft IIS 4.0 improperly processes URL hexadecimal encodings by accepting and decoding non-hexadecimal "digits" within a URL encoded string (e.g., `%3P`, `%2H`, `%1U`). This deviates from RFC 1738, which specifies that only hexadecimal digits are valid after the percent sign.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Non-standard URL decoding:** IIS decodes certain non-hexadecimal sequences into characters, which creates an alternate way to represent characters in URLs that other software may not recognize.
- **Bypassing third-party security mechanisms:** This alternate representation can be used to bypass security mechanisms in third-party software (such as SecurID agent) that are not aware of IIS's non-standard decoding of URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Access control bypass:** Attackers can bypass access control mechanisms of third-party applications running on top of IIS, allowing access to protected resources without proper authorization, such as documents behind SecurID authentication.
- **IDS evasion:** Network-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) unaware of this IIS behavior can be evaded, allowing attackers to potentially carry out malicious activities without being detected.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted URLs:** Attackers can construct URLs using illegal hexadecimal encodings that would be interpreted differently by IIS and by third party security software (e.g. `/conf%3Pdential/secret.doc` instead of `/confidential/secret.doc`).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected IIS server.
- The attacker needs to know (or guess) the vulnerable URL or parameters to manipulate the encoding to bypass security checks.
- The attacker requires a vulnerable third-party security application (e.g. SecurID agent) running on top of IIS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not in IIS itself but arises from its non-standard handling of URL encoding combined with the lack of awareness of that behavior from third-party software.
- The vulnerability affects IIS 4.0, and is fixed in later versions of IIS and by a specific Microsoft patch.
- Examples provided show how to bypass the SecurID agent authentication and potentially evade network intrusion detection systems.
