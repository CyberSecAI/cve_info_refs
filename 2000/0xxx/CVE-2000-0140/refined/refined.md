The provided content describes two denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities in Internet Anywhere Mail Server version 3.1.3.

**Vulnerability 1: RETR DoS in POP service**
*   **Root Cause:** The server crashes after receiving a "RETR" command with an excessively large numerical argument. The vulnerability lies in the server's failure to properly validate or handle the input when processing the `RETR` command, specifically within the `atoi()` function which is used to convert the argument to an integer.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input validation for the argument passed to the `RETR` command when converted to an integer. Failure to check the return value of the `atoi()` function.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause the mail server to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a specially crafted `RETR` command with an extremely large numerical argument to the POP3 service.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to connect to the POP3 service and send commands. They need valid user credentials, but the specific mailbox contents do not seem to matter as the crash occurs during argument parsing.

**Vulnerability 2: Multiple Connections to Port 25 DoS**
*   **Root Cause:** The server's inability to handle a large number of concurrent connection requests to port 25 (SMTP). The server's resources are exhausted when too many connections are initiated.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of proper connection handling and resource management, leading to the server being overwhelmed with multiple connection attempts.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A remote attacker can cause the mail server to become unresponsive and refuse new connections, resulting in a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Establishing a large number of concurrent connections to port 25 (SMTP).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must be able to connect to the server on port 25. No user credentials are required.
