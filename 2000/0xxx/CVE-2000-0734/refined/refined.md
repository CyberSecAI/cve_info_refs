- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap memory buffer overflow exists in Eeye Iris 1.01 and SpyNet CaptureNet v3.12.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap memory buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes the affected network sniffing program to crash and can consume system resources up to 100% usage until the program crashes. This results in a denial of service condition.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending multiple UDP connections to random ports on the host where Iris or SpyNet CaptureNet is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target machine. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
