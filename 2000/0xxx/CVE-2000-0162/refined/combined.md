# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-011 - Critical

## Patch Available for "VM File Reading" Vulnerability

Updated: July 01, 2009

**Version:** 3.0

**Originally Posted**: February 18, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in the MicrosoftÂ® virtual machine (Microsoft VM). The vulnerability could enable a malicious web site operator to read files from the computer of a person who visited his site or read web content from inside an intranet if the malicious site is visited by a computer from within that intranet. In both cases the malicious applet would have to know the exact name and location of the files. Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-011.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-011)

### General Information

## Issue

The Microsoft VM is a virtual machine for the Win32Â® operating environment. It runs atop Microsoft WindowsÂ® 95, 98, or Windows NTÂ®, or Windows 2000. It ships as part of each operating system, and also as part of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

The version of the Microsoft VM that ships with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x and Internet Explorer 5.x contains a security vulnerability that could allow a Java applet to operate outside the bounds set by the sandbox. A malicious user could write a Java applet that could read - but not change, delete or add - files from the computer of a person who visited his site or read web content from inside an intranet if the malicious site is visited by a computer from within that intranet. The malicious user would need to know the exact path and filename of the files he wished to read.

**Affected Software Versions**

Versions of the Microsoft VM are identified by build numbers, which can be determined using the JVIEW tool, as discussed in the FAQ. The following builds of the Microsoft VM are affected:

* All builds in the 2000 series.
* All builds in the 3100 series.
* All builds in the 3200 series.

  **Note:** The Microsoft VM ships as part of several products. However, the primary ship vehicle is Internet Explorer.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0162](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0162)
