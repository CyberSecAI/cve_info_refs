- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A security flaw in the Microsoft Virtual Machine (Microsoft VM) allows a Java applet to operate outside its sandbox limitations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a sandbox escape, where a Java applet can bypass its intended security restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious Java applet could read files from the victim's computer or from web content within an intranet. This is limited to reading; files cannot be modified, deleted, or added.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious website operator hosts a Java applet that, when visited by a user with a vulnerable Microsoft VM, attempts to read files on the user's computer or within their local network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the exact path and filename of the files they intend to read on the victim's machine or intranet. The attacker must also host the malicious applet on a website and lure the victim to visit the site using a browser with a vulnerable Microsoft VM.
