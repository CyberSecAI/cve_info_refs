Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Permissions Issue:** The MSWordView application, when used with IMP, creates temporary HTML files in `/tmp` with world-readable permissions (`-rw-r--r--`).
2.  **Inadequate Cleanup:** IMP fails to clean up temporary files created by MSWordView if the MSWordView process does not exit correctly, leading to accumulation of files in `/tmp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** World-readable permissions on temporary files expose the content of Word document attachments converted to HTML, potentially leaking sensitive information to any user with access to the server's filesystem.
2.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Accumulation of temporary files due to improper cleanup can fill up the `/tmp` filesystem, causing a denial of service by exhausting disk space and making the server inoperable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with shell access can read the temporary HTML files in `/tmp` and gain access to the content of Word documents processed by other users.
2.  **Denial of Service:** An attacker with an email account on the vulnerable server can send multiple large Word attachments and trigger the improper cleanup, filling up the `/tmp` directory and causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** Requires shell access to the server to read the temporary files in `/tmp`.
2.  **Denial of Service:** Requires an email account on the vulnerable server to send attachments and trigger the cleanup failure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Information Disclosure:** Requires shell access to the vulnerable server. This often means the attacker has an account or other form of access to the server, in addition to just having access to the webmail service.
2.  **Denial of Service:** Requires an email account on the vulnerable server. This can be an attacker with access to the mail system, not just any random user on the internet.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The advisory mentions that the permissions problem is fixed in IMP 2.2 beta versions by setting the umask to 077. A workaround is suggested for IMP 2.0.11 users to change the temporary file storage location to a directory with appropriate permissions.
*   The DoS vulnerability has no immediate fix, but a workaround is provided by implementing a cron job to remove old temporary files or to monitor and react to the amount of space the files take up.
*   The advisory notes that many servers mix shell and webmail access, making the information disclosure problem a significant concern.
*   The issue is specific to the combination of IMP with MSWordView.
*   The DoS can be triggered by stopping the loading process while viewing attachments.
