**CVE-2000-0461** is related to patch **016**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow in the RSAREF code included in the USA version of the libssl package (called sslUSA).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: The overflow is potentially exploitable in isakmpd if SSL/RSA features are enabled or used. While initially thought not exploitable in OpenSSH, a note was later added that the problem was in fact exploitable in OpenSSH as well.
*   **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the buffer overflow in the RSAREF code within the vulnerable libssl package, specifically targeting services like isakmpd or OpenSSH that utilize the affected SSL/RSA features.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to send malicious data that triggers the overflow in the RSAREF code.
