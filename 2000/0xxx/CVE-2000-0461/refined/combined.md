Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/common/013_addusery2k.patch)

                        * **014: Y2K FIX: Jan 3, 2000**

                          A minor problem; the sparc eeprom(8) command is not Y2K compliant.

                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/sparc/014_eepromy2k.patch)
                          This is the second revision of the patch.

                          * **015: Y2K FIX: Jan 9, 2000**
                              *All architectures*

                            The at(1) command was unable to parse some kinds of dates.

                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/common/015_aty2k.patch)

                            * **016: SECURITY FIX: Dec 2, 1999**
                                *All architectures*

                              A buffer overflow in the RSAREF code included in the
                              USA version of the libssl package (called **sslUSA**, is
                              possibly exploitable in isakmpd if SSL/RSA features
                              are enabled or used.

                              [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com) and httpd (with -DSSL) are not
                              vulnerable.

                              **NOTE: International users using the ssl26 package are not affected.**

                              To check what package you are using, use
                              ```

                              # pkg_info sslUSA26

                              ```
                              The patched library says:

                              "ssl26.1 USA-only non-commercial crypto libs incl. SSL & RSA"

                              Non-commercial USA users who installed the ssl package before December 3
                              should upgrade their **sslUSA26** package using:
                              ```

                              # pkg_delete sslUSA26
                              # pkg_add -v sslUSA26.tar.gz

                              ```
                              Using the new **sslUSA26.tar.gz** files which have been placed
                              on the FTP mirrors.

                              [For more information, see the advisory](advisories/sslUSA).

                              **NOTE: this problem turned out to not be unexploitable in OpenSSH.**

                              * **017: FUNCTIONALITY ADDITION: Nov 14, 1999**
                                  *All architectures*

                                Fortran doesn't work right. The file /usr/include/g2c.h is missing in the
                                release.

                                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/common/008_fortran.patch)
                                The patch fixes the source tree and describes how to properly add
                                [the include file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/common/g2c.h) to your system.

                                * **018: SECURITY FIX: Jan 20, 2000**
                                    *All architectures*

                                  Systems running with procfs enabled and mounted are vulnerable
                                  to having the stderr output of setuid processes directed onto
                                  a pre-seeked descriptor onto the stack in their own procfs memory.

                                  Note that procfs is not mounted by default in OpenBSD.

                                  * **020: LIBRARY IMPROVEMENT: Jan 26, 2000**
                                      *All architectures*

                                    syslog(3) would not try to reopen the socket, thus, nightly newsyslog(8)
                                    would cause syslogd(8) to not see new messages.

                                    * **019: DRIVER IMPROVEMENT: Jan 20, 2000**
                                        *All architectures*

                                      Intel fxp cards with National Semiconductor PHYs (nsphy) have trouble
                                      negotiating and maintaining 100Mb link integrity.

                                      * **021: RZSZ SNOOPING: Jan 31, 2000**
                                          *All architectures*

                                        The rzsz port was removed from the ports collection, as it collects and
                                        sends user information to a designated email address, effectively spying on
                                        you. *It is recommended that you remove this package if you installed
                                        it*.

                                        * **022: SECURITY FIX: May 25, 2000**
                                            *All architectures*

                                          xlockmore has a localhost attack against it which allows recovery of the encrypted
                                          hash of the root password. The damage to systems using DES passwords from this
                                          attack is pretty heavy, but to systems with a well-chosen root password under
                                          blowfish encoding
                                          (see [crypt(3)](https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-2.6/crypt.3))
                                          the impact is much reduced.

                                          (Aside: We do not consider this a localhost root hole in the default install,
                                          since we have not seen a fast blowfish cracker yet ;-)

                                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.6/common/022_xlockmore.patch)
                                          This is the 2nd patch designed to solve this problem.

                                          * **023: SECURITY FIX: May 25, 2000**
                                              *All architectures*

                                            A misuse of ipf(8)
                                            *keep-state* rules can result in firewall rules being
                                            bypassed.
                                            This patch also includes fixes for an unaligned timestamp issue,
                                            and reliability fixes for ipmon and the in-kernel ftp proxy.

                                            It updates ipf to version 3.3.16.

                                            * **024: SECURITY FIX: May 26, 2000**
                                                *All architectures*

                                              Kernel contained an undocumented system call used to lock semaphore operations
                                              while they were being sampled by the ipcs(1) command. This locking could be
                                              used as a local denial of service attack which would block the exiting of
                                              processes which had semaphore resources allocated. Processes not using
                                              semaphores are not affected, so the actual effect is very minimal.
