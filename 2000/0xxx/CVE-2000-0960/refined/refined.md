The provided content describes an information disclosure vulnerability in Netscape Messaging Server 4.15p1.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The POP3 server provides different error messages when authentication fails due to an invalid password versus an invalid username.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Disclosure: The server reveals whether a given username exists on the system by providing a different error message for an invalid username versus an invalid password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Email address harvesting: Attackers can use this vulnerability to identify valid email addresses on the server. This information can be used to build spam lists.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: Attackers can connect to the POP3 service (port 110) via telnet or similar tools.
- Specific commands: The attacker uses `USER` command with an email address, and then `PASS` command to provoke different responses from the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection to the POP3 service. No special privileges on the system are required.
