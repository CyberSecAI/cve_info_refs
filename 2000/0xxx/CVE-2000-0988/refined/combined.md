|  | Support for WinU and Full Control was discontinued effective January 14 2020 Microsoft discontinued support for its Windows 7 operating system effective January 14 2020. On that date Bardon Data Systems discontinued its own Windows 7 support as well, for our products WinU and Full Control. WinU and Full Control will not run on any versions of Windows beyond Windows 7 as we feel those versions have too many holes and backdoors to be considered suitable for a secure managed business environment. WinU and Full Control continue to function on supported versions of Windows but technical support and upgrades are no longer available. We are grateful to our many WinU and Full Control customers for your business over the years and we wish you much success in your future endeavors.
