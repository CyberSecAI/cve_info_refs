- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows 2000 implementation of the Protected Store, which is part of CryptoAPI, uses a 40-bit key to encrypt sensitive information, such as private keys and certificates, even when stronger cryptography is available on the machine.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Weak encryption of the Protected Store using a 40-bit key, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user who has gained complete administrative control of a Windows 2000 machine could potentially compromise users' sensitive information stored in the Protected Store by performing a brute-force cryptographic attack due to the weak 40-bit encryption.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to first gain complete administrative control over the target machine, then attempt a brute-force attack on the weakly encrypted protected store.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker must achieve complete administrative control over a Windows 2000 machine and possess the ability to conduct a brute-force cryptographic attack.
