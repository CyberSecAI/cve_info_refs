- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Windows NT Recycle Bin for a given user maps to a folder whose name is based on the owner's SID. The folder is created the first time the user deletes a file, and the owner is given sole permissions to it. If a malicious user could create the folder before the legitimate user, they could assign any desired permissions to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure creation of the Recycle Bin folder, allowing for unauthorized access control modification.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user could create, modify, or delete files in another user's Recycle Bin. While they generally would not be able to read the files unless they already had permission, they could cause data loss or disrupt the user experience.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to create the Recycle Bin folder before the legitimate user does, on the same machine and partition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to share a machine with the victim and needs to be able to act before the legitimate user creates their Recycle Bin.
