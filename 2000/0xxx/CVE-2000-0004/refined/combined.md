I discovered this over 2 years ago and told them about it [summer '97], but I
guess they are just to lazy to care about security..  There is infact many more
problems with ZBServer Pro and Personal that I found out as well. Lets see if i
can recall them correctly. I don't have a windows machine handy to test them
out.

If you goto a url like <http://zbserver.com/cgi-bin/./prog.exe> it will send you
the .exe file instead of processing it.. same goes for the server side includes
you may have in your pages [<http://zbserver.com/./index.html>]. Very very bad
thing to do. =)

Also, and I believe this was only in the Personal edition but I may be wrong, if
you call up a dos cgi program with a url like <http://zbserver.com/cgi-bin/>[26
periods]/cgi.bat it will open a dos window on your desktop instead of running
the program it's supposed to.. This could lead to a DoS attack by opening 500
dos prompts on the desktop, and slowly using up memory. If i can find the file
I wrote up on all this, I'll pass it along.

I could be wrong about the details in that last paragraph, but I know it can be
done!

PS: If you are using the shareware version without registering, and it appends
that line 'Powered by ZBServer Pro' or something to that affect on the bottom
of every html page, you can very easily search out potential victims using
altavista..

I'm sure if you poke around you can discover more problems.
