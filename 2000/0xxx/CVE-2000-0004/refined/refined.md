The provided content is related to CVE-2000-0004.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The code that handles GET commands has an unchecked buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow vulnerability in handling GET commands
- Exposing executable files by requesting them with `/cgi-bin/./prog.exe`
- Exposing server-side include files by requesting them with `/./index.html`
- Possible denial of service (DoS) by opening multiple DOS windows when requesting `/cgi-bin/`[26 periods]`cgi.bat`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution if the buffer is overflowed
- Exposure of executable files
- Exposure of server-side include files
- Possible DoS by exhausting resources

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted GET request with an overflowed buffer
- Requesting executable files directly via URL manipulation
- Requesting server-side include files directly via URL manipulation
- Sending a URL with multiple periods followed by `cgi.bat` to open numerous DOS windows

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server
