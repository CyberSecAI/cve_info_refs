# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-065 - Critical

## Patch Available for 'Still Image Service Privilege Escalation' Vulnerability

Published: September 06, 2000 | Updated: May 18, 2003

**Version:** 1.1

**Originally posted:** September 6, 2000

**Updated:** June 13, 2003

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Windows 2000. The vulnerability could allow a user logged onto a Windows 2000 machine from the keyboard to become an administrator on the machine.

**Affected Software:**

* Microsoft Windows 2000

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0851](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0851)

### General Information

## Technical details

**Technical description:**

An unchecked buffer exists in the 'Still Image Service' on Windows 2000 hosts. A locally logged-on user can execute malicious code that will use the still image service to escalate their permissions equal to that of the Still Image Service, namely, LocalSystem.

The Still Image Service is not installed by default, but is automatically installed, via plug-n-play, when a user attaches a still image device (i.e. digital camera, scanner, etc.) to a Windows 2000 host.

## Frequently asked questions

**What's this bulletin about?**

Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS00-065](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms00-065) announces the availability of a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Windows 2000. The vulnerability could allow a user to gain inappropriate privileges on a Windows 2000 machine. Microsoft is committed to protecting customers' information, and is providing the bulletin to inform customers of the vulnerability and what they can do about it.

**What's the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a privilege elevation vulnerability. A malicious user who could interactively log on to a Windows 2000 machine and run a program could pose as any other user on the machine, including the administrator or the system itself.
The machines most likely to be affected by this vulnerability are Windows 2000 Professional workstations and terminal servers, because they typically allow normal users to interactively log onto them. Security-critical machines such as domain controllers, ERP servers, print and file servers, and SQL servers typically do not allow normal users to interactively log onto them and, if this were the case, would not be at risk from this vulnerability.
The vulnerability would allow a Guest user or normal user to assume any desired level of privilege on the machine that was compromised. In the case of a compromised workstation, it's unlikely, but not impossible, that the malicious user could extend control to the rest of the network. However, if he or she compromised a domain controller, he or she would gain de facto control of the domain.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

There is an unchecked buffer in the Still Image Service that may allow a malicious program to obtain LocalSystem privileges. With this level of access, the currently logged-on user can obtain administrative privileges on the host.

**What is the Still Image Service?**

The Still Image Service is automatically installed when a still image device (digital camera, scanner, etc) is attached to the Windows 2000 host. Further details on the still image service can be found at the following URL's:

</https:>[https:](https://)

**Does this vulnerability affect any versions of Windows 98, Windows ME, or NT4?**

No. This vulnerability, and the associated patch, affect only Windows 2000 hosts.

**Who should use the patch?**

Microsoft recommends that all Windows 2000 users consider installing the patch.

**What does the patch do?**

The patch eliminates the vulnerability by providing updated Still Image code.

**Where can I get the patch?**
