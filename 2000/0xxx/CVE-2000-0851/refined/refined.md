- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer exists in the 'Still Image Service' on Windows 2000 hosts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow in the 'Still Image Service'.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A locally logged-on user can execute malicious code that will use the still image service to escalate their permissions to LocalSystem, thus gaining administrative privileges on the host. This could allow a malicious user to take control of a workstation, or even a domain, if a domain controller is compromised.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access. A malicious user needs to be able to interactively log on to the Windows 2000 machine and run a program.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have interactive logon access to a Windows 2000 machine. They need to be able to execute a program on the machine.
