- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow exists in the Windows 95 and Windows 98 networking software when processing file name strings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A buffer overflow vulnerability is present in the networking software. This is triggered by providing a very long or malformed filename string.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation could lead to a system crash or the execution of arbitrary code on the affected machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via a file:// URL or a UNC string on a remote website or when a long file name is included in an email message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers can exploit this remotely via a malicious website or email, requiring the user to either visit a website or open an email with a specially crafted filename.
