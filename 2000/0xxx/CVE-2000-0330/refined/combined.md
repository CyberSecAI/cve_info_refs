# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-049 - Critical

## Patch Available for "File Access URL" Vulnerability

Published: November 12, 1999

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** November 12, 1999

**Summary**

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site or e-mail message to cause the Windows machine to crash, or to run arbitrary code.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletins/fq99-049.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq99-049).

**Issue**

There is a buffer overflow in the Windows 95 and Windows 98 networking software that processes file name strings. If the networking software were provided with a very long random string as input, it could crash the machine. If provided with a specially-malformed argument, it could be used to run arbitrary code on the machine via a classic buffer overrun attack.

The vulnerability could be exploited remotely in cases where a file:// URL or a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) string on a remote web site included a long file name or where a long file name was included in an e-mail message.

**Affected Software Versions**

* The buffer overrun is present in the networking software in all versions of Windows 95 and Windows 98.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0330](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0330)
