- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that IIS 4.0 does not limit the size of the buffer that can be reserved for chunked encoding transfers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A lack of buffer size limits when handling chunked encoding in HTTP POST or PUT requests. This allows a malicious user to allocate large buffers and not send any data, thus reserving memory.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could consume all the resources on the web server by requesting very large buffers without sending any data. This could prevent the server from servicing other users, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP POST or PUT requests using chunked encoding.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the IIS 4.0 server.
