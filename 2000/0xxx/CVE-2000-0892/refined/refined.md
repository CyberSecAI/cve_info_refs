- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Some telnet clients, when used as helper applications by web browsers, disclose sensitive environment variables to a malicious telnet server before authentication. This is due to the telnet client implementing RFC 1572, which allows servers to request environment variables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Telnet clients implementing RFC 1572 transmit environment variables to a server prior to authentication, exposing potentially sensitive information.
    - Web browsers using vulnerable telnet clients as helper applications for telnet URLs can be exploited to leak environment variables.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive information stored in environment variables, such as USER, HOME, PGPPASS, SSH_CLIENT, can be revealed.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious telnet server can request environment variables from a vulnerable telnet client.
    - A malicious actor can craft a `telnet:` URL that, when opened in a web browser configured to use a vulnerable telnet client, triggers the transmission of environment variables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to control a telnet server that requests environment variables.
    - The attacker must also have a way to get the victim to interact with a malicious `telnet:` URL through a web browser configured to use a vulnerable client as a helper application.
