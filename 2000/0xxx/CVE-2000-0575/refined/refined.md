- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `sshd` daemon incorrectly sets the `KRB5CCNAME` environment variable to "none" when Kerberos support is compiled in, regardless of whether Kerberos authentication is actually being used. This leads to Kerberos tickets being stored in a file named "none" in the user's current directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure storage of Kerberos tickets. The ticket cache, which normally resides in a protected directory, is placed in the user's current directory with the filename "none". This location is easily accessible and vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the Kerberos tickets can impersonate the legitimate user for the lifetime of the ticket. This can lead to unauthorized access to systems and resources.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the Kerberos ticket cache file in several ways:
    - Insecure file sharing protocols such as NFS or SMB. If the user's home directory is NFS mounted, the tickets can be transmitted over the network in the clear.
    - Inherited ACLs: If the ticket cache is placed in a directory with an overly permissive ACL, another user could gain read access.
    - Removable media: If the user's current directory is on removable media, it can be physically compromised.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to either have access to the user's machine or be able to intercept network traffic (e.g. via NFS). Once they have access to the ticket, they could impersonate the user on the Kerberized network.
