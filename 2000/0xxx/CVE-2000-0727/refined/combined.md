CONECTIVA LINUX SECURITY ANNOUNCEMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PACKAGE   : xpdf
SUMMARY   : Shell commands in URLs and insecure use of /tmp
DATE      : 2000-09-12 15:31:00
RELEVANT
RELEASES  : 4.0, 4.0es, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, prg gráficos, ecommerce, 5.1

----------------------------------------------------------------------

DESCRIPTION
 Versions prior to 0.91 of xpdf have some security problems:
 1) Insecure file creation in /tmp which could be exploited via
 symlink attacks;
 2) Shell commands inserted in URLs would be expanded and executed by
 the shell when the user opened such an URL from within xpdf.
 Please note that xpdf is not SUID and therefore any attack which uses
 these vulnerabilities will only have the privileges of the user
 running xpdf.

SOLUTION
 All xpdf users should upgrade.

                Linux-Mandrake Security Update Advisory
________________________________________________________________________

Package name:		xpdf
Date:			August 29th, 2000
Advisory ID:		MDKSA-2000:041

Affected versions:	6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.1
________________________________________________________________________

Problem Description:

 There is a potential race condation when using tmpnam() and fopen() in
 xpdf versions prior to 0.91.  This exploit can be only used as root to
 overwrite arbitrary files if a symlink is created between the calls to
 tmpname() and fopen().  There is also a problem with malicious
 URL-type links in PDF documents that contain quote characters which
 could also potentially be used to execute arbitrary commands.  This is
 due to xpdf calling system() with a netscape (or similar) command plus
 the URL.  The 0.91 release of xpdf fixes both of these potential
 problems.  Although there are no known exploits, users are encouraged
 to upgrade their system with these updates.
________________________________________________________________________

Please verify these md5 checksums of the updates prior to upgrading to
ensure the integrity of the downloaded package.  You can do this by
running the md5sum program on the downloaded package by using
"md5sum package.rpm".

To upgrade automatically, use « MandrakeUpdate ».

If you want to upgrade manually, download the updated package from one
of our FTP server mirrors and uprade with "rpm -Uvh package_name".

You can download the updates directly from:
  ftp://ftp.linux.tucows.com/pub/distributions/Mandrake/Mandrake/updates
  ftp://ftp.free.fr/pub/Distributions_Linux/Mandrake/updates

Or try one of the other mirrors listed at:

  <http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/ftp.php3>.

Updated packages are available in the "updates/[ver]/RPMS/" directory.
For example, if you are looking for an updated RPM package for
Linux-Mandrake 7.1, look for it in "updates/7.1/RPMS/".  Updated source
RPMs are available as well, but you generally do not need to download
them.

Please be aware that sometimes it takes the mirrors a few hours to
update, so if you want an immediate upgrade, please use one of the two
above-listed mirrors.
