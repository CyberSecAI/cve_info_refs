- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability occurs when a virtual directory name contains a legal file extension. This causes the web server to bypass normal server-side processing of files within that virtual directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is in how the web server handles virtual directories with names that mimic file extensions. This allows for the circumvention of server-side processing, leading to unintended exposure of file contents.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The most significant impact is the potential exposure of source code for files like .ASP. This could reveal sensitive information, business logic, or credentials hardcoded into the server-side scripts.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted requests to a web server targeting files within a specially named virtual directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected web server. No special privileges on the server are required; the vulnerability can be triggered by a regular user visiting the site. The attacker needs to have knowledge of virtual directories with names containing file extensions to exploit the vulnerability.
