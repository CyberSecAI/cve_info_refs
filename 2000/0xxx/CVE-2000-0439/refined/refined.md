The provided document discusses multiple vulnerabilities, with CVE-2000-0439 specifically addressing the "Unauthorized Cookie Access" vulnerability.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of specially crafted URLs within Internet Explorer, which allows bypassing the intended cookie access restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient domain restriction:** The IE security model intends to restrict cookies to the domain that created them. However, a specially malformed URL can circumvent this restriction.
- **Improper URL handling:** The vulnerability lies in how Internet Explorer processes URLs, allowing an attacker to access cookies outside of their own domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read, add, or change cookies belonging to other sites.
- The extent of the impact depends on the information contained within the accessed cookies and the privacy practices of the affected websites.
- Although the attacker cannot directly get a list of all cookies on the victim's system, they can access individual cookies if they entice a user to click a crafted link.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious website:** An attacker hosts a website containing specially crafted URLs.
- **User Interaction:** A user must be lured into clicking a malicious link on the attacker's site. This link triggers the vulnerability, allowing the attacker to access the victim's cookies for a different domain.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to host a web page containing the specially crafted URL.
- The attacker needs to trick the user to interact with the malicious link on the attacker-controlled website.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger patch that addresses other issues within Internet Explorer.
- A patch is available, but it requires Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2 or Internet Explorer 5.01 to be installed.
