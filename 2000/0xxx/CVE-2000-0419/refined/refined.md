A malicious website operator could use this vulnerability to execute Office functions on the computer of a user who visited the site. This could potentially lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or other harmful outcomes within the user's Office environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious website that leverages the vulnerable ActiveX control. The attacker would need to host a webpage designed to invoke the vulnerable control on a user's system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
