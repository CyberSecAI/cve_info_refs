# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-034 - Critical

## Patch Available for "Office 2000 UA Control" Vulnerability

Published: May 12, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** May 12, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Office 2000 and Office 2000 family members. The vulnerability could allow a malicious web site operator to take inappropriate action on the computer of a user who visited his web site.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-034.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-034)

### General Information

## Issue

An ActiveX control that ships as part of Office 2000 is incorrectly marked as "safe for scripting". This control, the Office 2000 UA Control, is used by the "Show Me" function in Office Help, and allows Office functions to be scripted. A malicious web site operator could use the control to carry out Office functions on the machine of a user who visited his site.

The control ships only as part of Office 2000 (and Office 2000 family members, as listed below). The patch removes all unsafe functionality, with the result that the "Show Me" function will be disabled in Office 2000.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Office 2000

  **Note:** The products in the Office suite also are available for purchase separately. The control ships as part of the following such products:

  + Word 2000
  + Excel 2000
  + Powerpoint 2000
  + Access 2000
  + Photodraw 2000
  + FrontPage 2000
  + Project 2000
  + Publisher 2000
  + Outlook 2000
  + Works 2000 Suite

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0419](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0419)

## History

The CERT Division is the birthplace of cybersecurity. For nearly 30 years, the CERT Division of the SEI has partnered with government, industry, law enforcement, and academia to advance cybersecurity and improve the security and resilience of computer systems and networks.

Originally focused on incident response, we have expanded into cybersecurity areas such as network situational awareness, malicious code analysis, secure coding, resilience management, insider threats, digital investigations and intelligence, workforce development, DevOps, forensics, software assurance, vulnerability discovery and analysis, and risk management.

## Former Director Richard Pethia

[Richard Pethia](/about/leadership/display.cfm?customel_datapageid_2623=3545) was founding director of the SEI's CERT Division. Pethia, who served as director of CERT from 1988 to 2016, guided the organization through tremendous growth and change. Under Pethia's leadership, the unit expanded and evolved from the CERT Coordination Center—a small group focused on computer incident response—to a research organization of more than 200 professionals dedicated to solving problems with widespread cybersecurity implications.
