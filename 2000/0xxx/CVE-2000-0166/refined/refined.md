- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an unchecked buffer in the `recv` function implementation of the TelnetD server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the TelnetD server due to lack of bounds checking on the data received by the `recv` function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a 100% CPU usage, implying a denial of service. The buffer overflow could potentially be used for arbitrary code execution but this is not explicitly stated in this content.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted data to the TelnetD server via the `recv` function can trigger the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send data to the TelnetD server, implying they need network access to the server.
