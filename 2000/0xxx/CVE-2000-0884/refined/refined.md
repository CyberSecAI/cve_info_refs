- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A canonicalization error in IIS 4.0 and 5.0 allows a malformed URL to access files and folders outside of the web folders, on the same logical drive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Canonicalization error in URL processing.
    - Insufficient access control for web server folders.
    - Default permissions for the IUSR_machinename account and its membership in the Everyone and Users groups grant access to many operating system commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Unauthorized access to files and folders outside the web root.
    - Ability to read, modify, or delete files.
    - Execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    - Potential for widespread damage, including reformatting the hard drive, creating new files, deleting existing files.
    - Privilege escalation to that of a locally logged-on user.
    - Ability to upload and execute malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malformed URLs containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "/../") sent to the web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Ability to send HTTP requests to a web server running vulnerable versions of IIS.
    - Knowledge of file paths on the target system (same logical drive as the web folders).
    - No specific prior authentication is required since the vulnerability is triggered within the security context of the IUSR_machinename account.
