- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The ISAPI filter that implements hit-highlighting functionality in Microsoft Index Server does not properly validate file requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    -  Malformed Hit-Highlighting Argument vulnerability: By providing a deliberately-malformed argument in a request to hit-highlight a document, it is possible to escape the virtual directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Allows retrieval of any file residing on the server itself and on the same logical drive as the web root directory, regardless of permissions.
    - A variant of this vulnerability could allow the source code of server-side files such as .ASP files to be read.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a request to the hit-highlighting functionality with a malformed argument.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server running the vulnerable software and have knowledge of the file system structure.
