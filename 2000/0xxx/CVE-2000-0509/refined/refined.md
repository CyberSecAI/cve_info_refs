- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Sambar Server's `sambar.dll` when handling input to the finger and whois demonstration scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in `sambar.dll`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Overwriting the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) allows for arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large hostname string to the finger or whois script. Specifically, a string of 32286 bytes + 4 bytes for the EIP is required, making a total of 32290 bytes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send a network request to the server with the specifically crafted hostname input.
