The content is related to CVE-2000-0653.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the fact that a browser window opened by an HTML email can establish a persistent link to the Outlook Express window. This allows a script within the browser window to access and retrieve the content of emails displayed in the Outlook Express preview pane, even after the original email is closed.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Persistent link between a browser window and Outlook Express window, allowing the browser to read content from the preview pane even after the initial email is closed.
    - HTML mail can open a browser window and link it back to the Outlook Express window

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - An attacker can "read over the shoulder" of the recipient by retrieving the text of emails as they are previewed in the Outlook Express preview pane. The text can be relayed back to the malicious user's website.
    - The attacker can passively eavesdrop on emails being previewed.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a malicious HTML email to a victim
    - The victim needs to open the malicious HTML email, which causes the creation of a linked browser window
    - The victim must have the preview pane enabled in Outlook Express

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send emails to the victim
    - The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML email with Javascript to establish the persistent link and exfiltrate the email content
    - The attacker needs a web server to receive the exfiltrated email data
