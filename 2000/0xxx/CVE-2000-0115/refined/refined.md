- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed regular expression within VBScript, when used in an ASP page processed by IIS, leads to a crash. Specifically, the pattern ".*" is identified as problematic.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way IIS processes VBScript regular expressions. A specific regular expression pattern can trigger an access violation and crash the `inetinfo.exe` process. The core issue seems related to how the regular expression engine in VBScript, part of IIS, handles ".*".

- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a denial of service, crashing the `inetinfo.exe` process, which is critical for IIS operation, thus rendering the web server unavailable.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a web request to an ASP page that contains the vulnerable VBScript code. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the execution of the problematic ASP page which contains the malformed regex.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send web requests to the affected IIS server and access or trigger the vulnerable ASP page. This typically involves being a client on a network that can communicate with the IIS server.
