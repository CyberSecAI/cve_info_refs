I can confirm that version 1.6* have a problem, as described in the initial report.

Until now, the command parser in War FTP Daemon 1.6* has allowed commands up to 8 KB \
in size. To prevent this, and other buffer-overflow problems, this size is decreased \
to (MAX_PATH + 8), and an additional check is added that prevents any command \
argument to exceed MAX_PATH in length.

A new version, 1.67-4 has been released with this modification. See \
<http://war.jgaa.com/alert/> for download details.
