- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The command parser in War FTP Daemon 1.6* allows commands up to 8 KB in size, leading to potential buffer overflow issues. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the handling of MKD and CWD commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking on command size and command arguments.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of Service (DoS). While the original reporter could not achieve EIP control, an access violation occurs when sending excessively long commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending overly long MKD or CWD commands to the FTP server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FTP server and send commands.
