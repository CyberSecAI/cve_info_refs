# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-024 - Critical

## Tool Available for "OffloadModExpo Registry Permissions" Vulnerability

Published: April 12, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** April 12, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a tool that installs tighter permissions on a Windows NTÂ® 4.0 registry key. The default permissions could allow a malicious user who can interactively log onto a Windows NT 4.0 machine to compromise the cryptographic keys of other users who subsequently log onto the same machine.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-024.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-024)

### General Information

## Issue

This vulnerability involves a registry key used by the CryptoAPI Base CSPs to specify the driver DLL for a hardware accelerator. By design, such a DLL would have access to users' public and private keys. Although only administrators should have permission to add such a DLL, the permissions on the key actually would allow any user who could interactively log onto the machine to do so. By writing a bogus DLL and installing it, a malicious user could compromise the keys of other users who subsequently used the machine.

The machines primarily at risk would be workstations and terminal servers. If normal security recommendations are followed, normal users will not be allowed to interactively log onto domain controllers, web servers, database servers, ERP servers, and other security-critical machines. Windows NT auditing could be used to determine who changed the key's value. A tool is available that resets the permissions on the affected key to the correct default values. In addition, it incorporates the functionality of the tool provided in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS00-008](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/ms00-008).
