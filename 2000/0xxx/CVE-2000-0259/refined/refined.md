- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the overly permissive default permissions on a specific registry key used by the CryptoAPI Base CSPs. This key is meant to specify the driver DLL for a hardware accelerator, and by design, such a DLL would have access to users' cryptographic keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core issue is that the registry key's permissions allow any interactive user to modify it, instead of restricting access to administrators. This allows a malicious user to point the key to a bogus DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation:** By writing a malicious DLL and registering it in the affected key, an attacker could compromise the cryptographic keys of other users who log onto the same machine.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves an interactive logon to a vulnerable Windows NT 4.0 system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to interactively log on to a vulnerable Windows NT 4.0 workstation or terminal server.
