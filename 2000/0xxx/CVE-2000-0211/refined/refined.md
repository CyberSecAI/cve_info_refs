- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an asynchronous handshake sequence between a Windows Media server and a Windows Media Player. Certain resource requests are dependent on the successful completion of previous ones. If client-side handshake packets are sent in a specific misordered sequence, with certain timing constraints, the server attempts to use a resource before initialization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A misordered handshake sequence and a lack of proper resource initialization handling on the server side.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition, causing the Windows Media Unicast Service to crash. All ongoing sessions are terminated.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a malicious or crafted client sending handshake packets in a specific out-of-order sequence with specific timing requirements.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs the ability to send network packets to the Windows Media server. They also require an understanding of the expected handshake sequence to be able to send the misordered packets.
