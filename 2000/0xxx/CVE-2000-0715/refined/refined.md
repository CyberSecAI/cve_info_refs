```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Diskcheck perl script creates a temporary file in the /tmp directory with a predictable name: /tmp/diskusagealert.txt.<pid>. It does not verify if this file is a symbolic link before writing to it.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Predictable temporary file name.
- Symlink following vulnerability when creating and writing to the temporary file.
- Script runs with root privileges.

Impact of exploitation:
A local attacker can create a symbolic link to an arbitrary file, and the Diskcheck script running with root privileges will then overwrite it with the content of the disk usage alert.

Attack vectors:
A local user can create a symbolic link to a sensitive file and then wait for the Diskcheck script to run and overwrite that file.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local user account on the system.
- Ability to create symbolic links in /tmp.
