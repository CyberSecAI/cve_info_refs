Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is that Microsoft IIS (versions 4 and 5) discloses the physical path of web directories when a request is made for a non-existent .ida or .idq file. The server responds with an error message that includes the full server-side path of the requested file, even though the file does not exist.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the server's internal file paths. This information is valuable to attackers as it reveals the server's directory structure and potential locations of sensitive files or scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Reconnaissance:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to gather information about the server's file system.
*   **Aid in other attacks:** As Kristoffer Ustad points out in the second message, the information disclosure could help an attacker locate the index.htm/l, using the revealed path. This can lead to website defacement by rewriting the index file.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector is sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the server for a non-existent .ida or .idq file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable IIS server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication or user privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in both IIS 4 (tested with SP5) and IIS 5.
*   The disclosed path is the physical path on the server's filesystem.
*   This vulnerability is noted as not being a 'big deal' in the original message but the second message points out how it can be combined with other exploits for greater impact.
