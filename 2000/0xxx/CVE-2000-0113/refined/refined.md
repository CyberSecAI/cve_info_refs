Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2000-0113

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Sygate 3.11 software included a "Remote Administration Engine" (RAE) accessible via Telnet on port 7323. This RAE was intended to be accessible only from the internal network but was inadvertently exposed to the internet.
- The software incorrectly determined which network interface was connected to the internet, potentially leading to the "trusted" network being the internet and the internal network being the "untrusted".
- There was no user authentication required when accessing the RAE, so anyone who could connect to the port had full access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Exposed Remote Administration Interface:** The RAE was accessible from the internet when it should have been restricted to the internal network only.
- **Lack of Authentication:** No username or password was required to access the RAE, making it vulnerable to unauthorized access.
- **Incorrect Network Interface Detection:** The software used inverse DNS queries to determine the internet interface, which could be fooled, leading to misconfiguration.
- **One-time connection per reboot:** The remote management service would shut down after the first client terminated a connection, but build 562 supposedly fixes this issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could monitor all TCP and UDP traffic going in and out of the Sygate gateway, allowing them to map the internal network.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could remotely shut down the Sygate service, disconnecting all internet access for the network.
- **Complete control:** With full access to the RAE, an attacker could potentially modify the Sygate server configurations and other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** An attacker could connect to the vulnerable port (7323) via Telnet from the internet.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TCP connection to port 7323 of the Sygate server from the internet.
- No prior authentication or authorization is needed.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same local network as the Sygate server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Sygate 3.11 and possibly earlier versions like 2.0.
- The vulnerability is mitigated if Sybergen Secure Desktop (SyShield) is installed or if the Sygate "Enhanced Security" mode is enabled.
- Sybergen released a new build (562) to address this vulnerability, which included a fix for the one-time connection per reboot issue.
- The original discovery of the vulnerability was accidental and not documented by Sybergen.
- The incorrect interface detection can be caused by hosting your own DNS server, causing Sygate to misidentify the interfaces.
