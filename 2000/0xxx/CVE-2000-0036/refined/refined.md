- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in Outlook Express 5 for Macintosh causes it to automatically download all content of an HTML email, including attachments, even though attachments should not be downloaded unless requested by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unintended automatic downloading of email attachments in Outlook Express 5 for Macintosh when receiving HTML emails.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could send a malicious HTML email with attachments, which would be automatically downloaded onto the user's computer without their consent. This could allow for the distribution of malware or other malicious content. However, the vulnerability does not allow for the automatic execution of downloaded attachments.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTML email with malicious attachments to a user of Outlook Express 5 for Macintosh.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send an HTML email and know the target is using the vulnerable software (Outlook Express 5 for Macintosh).
