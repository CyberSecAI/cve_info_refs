- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ActiveX control used to invoke scriptlets acts as a rendering engine for HTML but will render any file type, not just HTML files. This allows a malicious actor to introduce script into an IE system file, and use the Scriptlet control to render the file, causing the script to run in the Local Computer Zone.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Scriptlet Component, an ActiveX control, incorrectly renders non-HTML files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious website operator could read files on a visiting user's computer.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious website operator can provide bogus script information, introduce it into a file with a known name on a user's system, then use the Scriptlet control to render the file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to host a malicious website and know or guess the exact name and path of the target file. The user must visit the malicious website and have Active Scripting enabled.
