- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Distributed GL Daemon (dgld) service, while not inherently vulnerable, is uniquely associated with SGI IRIX systems. Its presence on port 5232 can be used to identify such systems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the ability to identify systems based on the presence of dgld. This information leakage can be used as a stepping stone for further attacks targeting known vulnerabilities in IRIX systems.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is information disclosure which allows attackers to identify IRIX systems. This enables them to then focus on exploiting other known vulnerabilities on those specific systems, such as ObjectServer or df vulnerabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves scanning for the dgld service running on port 5232.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need the capability to perform port scans. They can be remote and do not need prior access to the targeted systems.
