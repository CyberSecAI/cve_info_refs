- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An ActiveX control allowed cabinet (.cab) files to be launched and executed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The ActiveX control could launch unsigned cabinet files that have been downloaded from the local machine. This allowed a malicious user to embed an unsafe executable within an email, disguised as a safe attachment.
- **Impact of exploitation**: If a user opened the disguised attachment, the operation would fail, but in some mail packages, a copy of the malicious file would be stored in a known location. The ActiveX control could then be used, via a script embedded in the email, to launch the copy, thus executing the malicious code.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability could be exploited via an HTML email containing a malicious cabinet file, disguised as a file of an innocuous type.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious cabinet file, embed it into an HTML email disguised as a safe attachment, and include a script that can utilize the ActiveX control to launch the file from its temporary location. The mail reader of the victim must allow scripts in HTML mail and store temporary copies of launched programs in known locations.
