## Procedure Available to Eliminate "Server-Side Image Map Components" Vulnerability

Published: April 21, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** April 21, 2000

#### Summary

A procedure is available to eliminate a security vulnerability affecting several web server products. The vulnerability could potentially allow a malicious web site visitor to perform actions that the system permissions authorize him to perform, but which he previously may have had no means of actually carrying out.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the remediation for it can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-028.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-028)

### General Information

## Issue

The FrontPage 97 and 98 Server Extensions include two components, Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe, that provide CERN- and NCSA-compliant server side image mapping support, respectively, for legacy browsers. Both components contain unchecked buffers that could be used to run arbitrary code. Although part of the Server Extensions, these components also install as part of several other web server products.

The risk posed by this vulnerability is significantly restricted by the fact that the affected components run "out of process" and in the security context of the user. Thus, there is no capability through this vulnerability to cause either the web service or the server itself to crash, nor is there an opportunity to run code in an elevated security context. However, it still could be possible for a malicious user to perform actions that, though permitted, he would otherwise be unable to take because the functionality was not exposed via a web page or script.

**Affected Software Versions**

The affected components are part of the FrontPage 97 and 98 Server Extensions. However, they also are distributed with several other web server products. The complete list of products in which these components ship is:

* FrontPage 97 Server Extensions, which ship as part of FrontPage 97
* FrontPage 98 Server Extensions, which ship as part of FrontPage 98
* MicrosoftÂ® Windows NTÂ® 4.0 Option Pack, which is the primary distribution mechanism for Internet Information Server 4.0
* Personal Web Server 4.0, which ships as part of WindowsÂ® 95 and 98

**Remediation**

To eliminate this vulnerability, customers who are hosting web sites using any of the affected products should delete all copies of the files Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe from their servers. The FAQ provides step-by-step instructions for doing this. The only functionality lost by deleting the file is the ability to support image mapping for web site visitors using legacy browser products.

ISPs and other customers who allow others to self-manage web sites should be aware that users who use FrontPage 97 or 98 to manage their sites could unknowingly re-introduce the affected components onto their sites when they upload content to it. This would not endanger the server at large, but could nevertheless be cause for concern. The FAQ discusses how to use functionality provided as part of the Server Extensions to prevent this from happening.
