- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The FrontPage 97 and 98 Server Extensions include two components, Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe, that provide server-side image mapping support. These components contain unchecked buffers that could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unchecked buffers in Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious web site visitor could potentially perform actions that the system permissions authorize him to perform, but which he previously may have had no means of actually carrying out. While the components run "out of process" and in the security context of the user, preventing crashing of the web service or server, it still allows execution of arbitrary code within the user's permissions.
- **Attack vectors**: By sending crafted input to the vulnerable components (Htimage.exe and Imagemap.exe) through a web interface, a remote attacker can exploit the buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a malicious web site visitor who can interact with a website using vulnerable server extensions.
