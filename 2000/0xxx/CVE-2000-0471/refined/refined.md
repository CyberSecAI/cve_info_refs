- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ufsrestore` utility, when operating in interactive mode, doesn't properly check the length of the pathname parameter supplied to the `extract` command. This can lead to a buffer overflow when the pathnames contained in the dump file are too long.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `ufsrestore` utility.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user can gain root privileges by exploiting this vulnerability.

- **Attack vectors**: A local user can trigger the vulnerability via crafted pathnames within the dump file by using the `extract` command in interactive mode.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to use the `ufsrestore` utility and have access to a crafted dump file with long pathnames.
