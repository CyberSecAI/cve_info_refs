## Race condition in periodic

#### Vulnerability Note VU#626919

Original Release Date: 2000-11-13 | Last Revised: 2001-03-28

---

### Overview

A race condition in the 'periodic' script allows local files to be overwritten. We believe that 'periodic' is typically used only with FreeBSD systems, though it may be installed on other systems.

### Description

| ['periodic](http://www.FreeBSD.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=periodic&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+5.0-current&format=html)' is a script used in conjunction with cron to execute jobs at specified intervals. During ordinary work, *periodic* creates temporary files with predictable names of the form **/tmp/periodic.*****$PID*** where *$PID* is the process identifier of the process running periodic. Because *periodic* is called by *cron* it runs with enhanced privileges. By polling the system for an executing instance of *periodic,* an intruder can exploit a race condition and create a symbolic link from **/tmp/periodic.*****$PID*** to a file of the intruders choosing. The target file will be overwritten. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker or intruder who has write access to the local file system and who can discover the PIDs of other processes (both capabilities are typical for ordinary local users) can overwrite any fileon the system regardless of the permissions on the file. This ability can be leveraged to gain root access in many circumstances. |

### Solution

| Apply a patch from your vendor. |
