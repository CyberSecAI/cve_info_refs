The provided content is related to CVE-2000-0890.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A race condition exists in the `periodic` script, which is used with cron to execute jobs at specified intervals. The script creates temporary files with predictable names in the `/tmp` directory, specifically `/tmp/periodic.*****$PID***`, where `$PID` is the process ID.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability lies in the predictable naming of temporary files combined with a race condition. An attacker can exploit this by polling for an instance of the `periodic` script. When a `periodic` process is found, an attacker can create a symbolic link from the predictable temporary file name (e.g., `/tmp/periodic.*****$PID***`) to a target file of their choice before `periodic` gets to it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite any file on the system, regardless of the file's permissions. This can be leveraged to gain root access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have write access to the local file system and be able to discover the PIDs of running processes (standard capabilities for local users). They need to be able to poll the system to find a running instance of periodic and then quickly create a symbolic link to overwrite the target file.
