# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-014 - Critical

## Patch Available for 'SQL Query Abuse' Vulnerability

Published: March 08, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** March 08, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® SQL Server 7.0 and Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0. The vulnerability could allow the remote author of a malicious SQL query to take unauthorized actions on a SQL Server or MSDE database or on the underlying system that was hosting the SQL Server or MSDE database.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability and the patch can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-014.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-014)

### General Information

## Issue

Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and MSDE 1.0 perform incomplete argument validation on certain classes of remotely submitted SQL statements. If a user is able to submit a particular form of a SQL Select statement to SQL Server or MSDE, it is possible to take actions on the SQL data base or, if the SQL Server or MDSE is operating in an account with elevated privileges on the underlying system, on the underlying operating system itself.

In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user would have to have the right to submit queries to the SQL Server or MSDE via ODBC, OLE DB, or DB-Library and be logged on using SQL Server Security. The user would not require any special privileges beyond the right to submit SQL queries.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft SQL Server Version 7.0 and Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0.

**Vulnerability Identifier:** [CVE-2000-0202](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2000-0202)

## Patch Availability

* [https:](https://)
  **Note:** The patch provided is applicable to SQL Server Version 7 and to SQL Server Version 7 with SP1. Customers should not attempt to apply the patch to SQL Server Version 7 SP2 Beta. Instead, they should wait for the release of SQL Server Version 7 SP2 which incorporates the changes made by the patch.
