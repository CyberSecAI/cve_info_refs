- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incomplete argument validation on certain classes of remotely submitted SQL statements in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient validation of SQL Select statement arguments, allowing for the execution of malicious SQL queries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized actions on the SQL database or the underlying system if the SQL Server/MSDE runs with elevated privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: Submitting malicious SQL Select statements via ODBC, OLE DB, or DB-Library.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the right to submit queries to the SQL Server or MSDE and must be logged in using SQL Server Security. No special privileges beyond the right to submit SQL queries are needed.
