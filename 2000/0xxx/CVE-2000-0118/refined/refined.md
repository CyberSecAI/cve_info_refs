Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) implementation in RedHat 6.1 handles failed login attempts via the `su` command. Specifically, the logging of failed attempts happens *after* the `sleep()` function call within `su`. This creates a race condition where a brute-force attack can repeatedly try login attempts, and if they fail quickly enough, the system logs will not record these attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient logging:** The primary weakness is the delayed logging of authentication failures. The `su` command, when a password is provided, goes through the PAM framework, which should handle login logging. The sleep call before the logging of the failed login provides a window of time where the failed attempt is not logged.
*   **Race Condition:** The timing window created by the sleep function allows attackers to rapidly attempt passwords without being recorded in system logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Stealthy Brute-Force Attacks:** An attacker can perform brute-force password cracking on user accounts without leaving any significant trace in system logs.
*   **Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation can result in unauthorized access to user accounts on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The provided exploit script `bruterh.sh` requires local access to the system to execute. 
*   **`su` command:** The attack leverages the `su` command for authentication attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local user account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to execute commands:** The attacker must be able to execute shell scripts or commands on the system.
*   **Knowledge of a wordlist:** The attacker requires a list of potential passwords.
*   **Setuid on /bin/su:** The `su` command must have the setuid bit set.

**Additional Details (from content):**

*   The exploit script `bruterh.sh` is written in bash.
*   The script attempts to brute-force a user account using a wordlist.
*   The script uses `usleep` to create the necessary delay to avoid the logging.
*   The script checks for the existence of `/bin/su`, `/bin/usleep`, and a valid wordlist file.
*   The exploit is also stated to have been tested on RedHat 5.x, suggesting a broader vulnerability than just RedHat 6.1.
*   The suggested fix is to ensure that logging happens before the `sleep()` function in `/bin/su` or to change its behavior.
