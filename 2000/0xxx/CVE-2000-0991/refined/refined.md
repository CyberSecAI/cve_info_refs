- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Two unchecked buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the HyperTerminal application. One in the code processing Telnet URLs and another in the code that processes session files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Buffer overflow in Telnet URL processing: A malformed Telnet URL, especially via HTML email, can cause a buffer overflow if HyperTerminal is the default Telnet client.
    - Buffer overflow in session file processing: A malformed session file can cause a buffer overflow when opened by HyperTerminal. The software does not correctly check the lengths of the data strings it reads in session files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of either vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. This could allow the attacker to compromise data or take control of the user's system, including actions like creating, deleting, or modifying data, communicating with websites, or reformatting the hard drive.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Malicious Telnet URL: An attacker could send an email containing a malformed Telnet URL, which, if opened, would trigger the buffer overflow, provided HyperTerminal is configured as the default telnet client.
    - Malicious session file: An attacker could craft a malicious session file containing malformed data and persuade the victim to open it, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
   - For the Telnet URL vulnerability, the attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTML email containing a malformed Telnet URL to the victim. HyperTerminal needs to be the default telnet client on the victim's machine.
   - For the session file vulnerability, the attacker needs to create a malicious session file and then rely on social engineering to convince the user to open it.
