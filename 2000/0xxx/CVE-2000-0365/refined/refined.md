The content is related to CVE-2000-0365.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect permissions being set on pseudo-terminal devices (/dev/pts/<number>) when an xterm is opened in RedHat 6.0. Specifically, the permissions for the "everyone" group are set to write ("w") access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the overly permissive write access granted to "everyone" on the /dev/pts/<number> devices associated with xterm sessions. This allows any local user to write arbitrary data to another user's terminal.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition for the user of the affected xterm. Attackers can flood the terminal with garbage data, making it unusable, or inject escape sequences to cause visual disruptions. More insidiously, attackers can potentially inject prompts or fake login screens to trick the user into revealing sensitive information like passwords.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local access. Any local user on the system can exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to execute commands on the vulnerable system.
