The content is related to CVE-2000-0768.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a new variant of the "Frame Domain Verification" vulnerability. It stems from an additional function that does not enforce proper separation of frames in the same window that reside in different domains.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper isolation of frames in a browser window.
- The vulnerable function fails to prevent data exchange between frames from different domains.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious website operator can open two frames, one in their domain and another on the user's local file system.
- The frame on the local file system can pass information to the frame in the malicious domain.
- Allows viewing of files on the user's computer if the attacker knows the exact path and filename. Only file types that can be opened in the browser window are affected.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user visits a malicious web site.
- The malicious web site opens two frames, one from its domain and another from the user's local file system.
- The vulnerable function is used to pass data from the local file system frame to the malicious domain frame.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to operate a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to know or guess the exact name and path of the file they want to view on the victim's computer.
- The attacker needs the victim to visit their website.
- Active scripting must be enabled in the Security Zone of the malicious website.
