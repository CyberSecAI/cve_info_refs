Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-0663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the registry entry specifying the Windows Shell executable (Explorer.exe) uses a relative path instead of an absolute path. This is due to legacy application compatibility issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Relative Path Usage:** The "Shell" registry value, located at `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Shell`, specifies "Explorer.exe" without the full path.
- **Search Order Vulnerability:** During system startup, Windows searches for the executable based on the path specified. This search includes the current directory which is `%SystemDrive%` (e.g., C:\) before system directories.
- **Writable Root Directory:** The root directory of the system drive (e.g., C:\) allows all interactive users to write to it by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious user can place a bogus executable named "Explorer.exe" in the root directory of the system drive (e.g., C:\). Upon the next user logon, this malicious executable would be loaded instead of the legitimate Windows shell, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user that logged in.
- **Privilege Escalation:** If a user with significant privileges logs on after the exploit, the malicious code would have those same privileges, potentially causing significant harm to the system or the domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to have interactive logon access to the vulnerable machine, meaning they can physically sit at the machine and log in.
- **File Placement:** The attacker must be able to write a file to the root directory of the system drive with the name `Explorer.exe`.
- **Subsequent Logon:** The malicious code executes when a user logs in after the attacker has placed the malicious `Explorer.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Interactive Logon:** The attacker needs to be able to log into the machine interactively.
- **File Write Access:** The attacker must have write permissions to the root directory of the system drive, which is default.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not related to `Explorer.exe` itself but due to how the shell executable is specified.
- The vulnerability cannot be exploited accidentally and would require specific steps from the attacker.
- The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely under normal conditions, except in a case where an administrator has shared the root directory and given write permissions to the attacker.
- Workstations and Terminal Servers are most at risk because they commonly allow interactive logons. Security-critical machines like domain controllers should not allow interactive logons, limiting their exposure to this specific vulnerability.

The provided patch addresses this by prepending `%systemroot%` to the path specified in the `Shell` registry value during system startup, effectively forcing the correct path to be used even though the registry entry itself specifies a relative path.
