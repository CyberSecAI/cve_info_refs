- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the CASSANDRA NNTPServer v1.10.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs when a large amount of data is sent as login information to the server on port 119, specifically in the `AUTHINFO USER` command.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation leads to a denial of service (DoS) condition, causing the NNTP service to become unresponsive and non-functional until the server is rebooted.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and involves sending a large string of characters as part of the `AUTHINFO USER` command to port 119.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to establish a network connection with the vulnerable server on port 119, and send a crafted `AUTHINFO USER` command with an oversized buffer.
