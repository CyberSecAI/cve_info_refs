- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Service Control Manager (SCM) creates named pipes for each service. The named pipe names are predictable. A malicious program can predict the name of the pipe for a service and create it before the service starts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Predictable named pipe creation by the SCM, allowing a malicious program to create the pipe before the legitimate service does. This allows the malicious program to impersonate the service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Privilege escalation. A malicious user can gain the privileges of the service, often LocalSystem, allowing them to take control of the machine.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access. An attacker must be able to log onto the target machine interactively and run arbitrary programs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Interactive login to the target machine and the ability to run arbitrary programs.
