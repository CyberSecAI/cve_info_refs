Patches for the OpenBSD base system are distributed as unified diffs.
Each patch contains usage instructions.
All the following patches are also available in one
[tar.gz file](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5.tar.gz)
for convenience.

Patches for supported releases are also incorporated into the
[-stable branch](stable.html).

* **001: SECURITY FIX: Aug 30, 1999**
    *All architectures*

  In cron(8), make sure argv[] is NULL terminated in the fake popen() and
  run sendmail as the user, not as root.
  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/012_cron.patch)

  * **002: SECURITY FIX: Aug 12, 1999**
      *All architectures*

    The procfs and fdescfs filesystems had an overrun in their handling
    of uio\_offset in their readdir() routines. (These filesystems are not
    enabled by default).
    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/011_miscfs.patch)

    * **003: SECURITY FIX: Aug 9, 1999**
        *All architectures*

      Stop profiling (see profil(2)) when we execve() a new process.
      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/010_profil.patch)

      * **004: SECURITY FIX: Aug 6, 1999**
          *All architectures*

        Packets that should have been handled by IPsec may be transmitted
        as cleartext. PF\_KEY SA expirations may leak kernel resources.
        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/009_ipsec_in_use.patch)

        * **005: SECURITY FIX: Aug 5, 1999**
            *All architectures*

          In /etc/rc, use mktemp(1) for motd re-writing, and change the find(1)
          to use -execdir.
          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/008_rc.patch)

          * **006: SECURITY FIX: Jul 30, 1999**
              *All architectures*

            Do not permit regular users to chflags(2) or fchflags(2) on character or
            block devices which they may currently be the owner of.
            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/007_chflags.patch)

            * **007: SECURITY FIX: Jul 27, 1999**
                *All architectures*

              Cause groff(1) to be invoked with the -S flag, when called by nroff(1),
              to avoid various groff features which may be security issues. On the
              whole, this is not really a security issue, but it was discussed on
              BUGTRAQ as if it is.
              [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/006_nroff.patch)

              * **008: RELIABILITY FIX: May 19, 1999**
                  *All architectures*

                Programs using fts(3) could dump core when given a directory structure
                with a very large number of entries.
                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/005_fts.patch)

                * **009: RELIABILITY FIX: May 19, 1999**
                    *All architectures*

                  Sequence numbers could wrap with TCP\_SACK and TCP\_NEWRENO, resulting in
                  failure to retransmit correctly.
                  [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/004_tcpsack.patch)

                  * **010: RELIABILITY FIX**
                      *All architectures*

                    Retransmitted TCP packets could get corrupted when flowing over an
                    IPSEC ESP tunnel.
                    [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/003_espdata.patch)

                    * **011: RELIABILITY FIX**
                        *All architectures*

                      A local user can crash the system by reading a file larger than 64meg
                      from an ext2fs partition.
                      [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/002_bmap.patch)

                      * **012: RELIABILITY FIX**
                          *All architectures*

                        PF\_KEY socket operations leak internal kernel resources, so that a
                        system running an IPsec key management daemon like photurisd or isakmpd
                        will cause the networking subsystem to stop working after a finite amount
                        of time.
                        [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/common/001_pfkey.patch)

                        * **013: Y2K FIX: Aug 30, 1999**

                          This patch corrects various OpenBSD/i386 2.5 problems with Y2K. The 2.6
                          release (released at 1 Dec 1999) has this problem solved. This patch is
                          just a workaround.
                          [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/i386/014_y2k.patch)

                          * **014: RELIABILITY FIX**

                            If a user opened the brooktree device on a system where it did not exist,
                            the kernel crashed.
                            [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/i386/013_brooktree.patch)

                            * **015: INSTALL PROBLEM**

                              The mac68k install utils were mistakenly left off the CD and out of
                              the FTP install directories. These tools have now been added to the
                              FTP install directories. See
                              <https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/2.5/mac68k/utils>

                              * **016: RELIABILITY FIX**

                                Two problems in the powerpc kernel trap handling cause severe system
                                unreliability.
                                [A source code patch exists which remedies this problem.](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/2.5/powerpc/001_trap.patch)
