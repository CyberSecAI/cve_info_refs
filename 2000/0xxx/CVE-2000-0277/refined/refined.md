- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Excel fails to display a security warning dialogue when an Excel 4.0 Macro Language (XLM) macro is launched from an external text file, unlike when macros are launched from within the current spreadsheet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to present a security warning when launching an XLM macro from an external text file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could trick a user into opening a spreadsheet and clicking a link to launch a macro, without the user receiving the expected security warning. This could lead to the execution of potentially harmful macros.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user would need to entice the victim into opening a specially crafted spreadsheet and then clicking a link to launch the macro stored in an external text file. The macro cannot be auto-launched.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to create a malicious spreadsheet with a link to a macro stored in an external text file and then convince the victim to open the spreadsheet and click the link.
