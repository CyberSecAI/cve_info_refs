# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-022 - Critical

## Patch Available for "XLM Text Macro" Vulnerability

Published: April 03, 2000

**Version:** 1.0

**Originally Posted:** April 03, 2000

#### Summary

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in MicrosoftÂ® Excel. The vulnerability could allow a macro to run without generating the expected security warning.

Frequently asked questions regarding this vulnerability can be found at [https://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-022.mspx](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/bulletin/fq00-022).

### General Information

## Issue

When an Excel user starts a macro that resides outside of the current spreadsheet (for example, in another spreadsheet), Excel by design will generate a warning dialogue. However, this dialogue is not generated if the macro consists of Excel 4.0 Macro Language (XLM) commands in an external text file.

The vulnerability only affects whether a warning dialogue is displayed - it does not change any other aspects of the macro's operation. A malicious user would need to entice a user into accepting the spreadsheet and opening it. Further, there is no means to "autolaunch" such a macro, so the malicious user would need to entice the user into clicking a link into to launch the macro.

**Affected Software Versions**

* Microsoft Excel 97
* Microsoft Excel 2000

  **Note:** Excel ships as a stand-alone product, and also as a member of the Office family.

  **Note:** Previous versions of Excel may be affected by this vulnerability. The recommended course of action for customers using these products is to upgrade to either Excel 97 or 2000, and apply the patch for them.
