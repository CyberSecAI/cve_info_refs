Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-0518:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Internet Explorer (IE) handles SSL certificate validation when a secure connection is established through an image or a frame.  Specifically, IE only verifies that the certificate was issued by a trusted root authority and does not validate the server name or expiration date in these specific cases.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incomplete Certificate Validation:** IE fails to perform full certificate validation (server name, expiration date) when an SSL connection is initiated via an image or frame.
*  **Lack of Revalidation:**  IE caches validated certificates and does not re-validate them if a new SSL session is established with the same server during the same browser session.

**Impact of exploitation:**

A malicious website operator could potentially misrepresent their site as a trusted site. This would allow them to conduct a secure session with the user under the guise of a trusted website. The attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate data transmitted during the supposedly secure session.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Image or Frame Connections:** Exploiting the incomplete certificate validation by establishing an SSL session via an image or a frame.
*   **DNS Cache Poisoning:**  An attacker could poison DNS records to redirect traffic intended for a trusted website to their malicious server.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker could physically replace the trusted server or intercept network traffic to present a fraudulent certificate.
*   **Session Replay:** After an initial valid SSL session, an attacker can inject their own certificate when the user revisits the same site within the same IE session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker would need significant control over the communication channel to perform DNS poisoning or replace the target server physically.
*   In the case of session replay, the attacker needs to intercept communication after the initial valid SSL session.
*   The attacker also requires a valid, but fraudulent SSL certificate that is trusted by the browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is particularly exploitable if the user revisits the same site during the same browser session without closing and reopening IE.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Internet Explorer 5.01 Service Pack 1 and Internet Explorer 5.5.
* The provided document mentions that the fix for the issue was rolled into a later patch (MS00-055) to minimize the number of patches users needed to install.
