Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2000-0603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and MSDE 1.0 handle permissions when a stored procedure is called from within a temporary stored procedure. Specifically, when the database is owned by the system administrator (**sa**) account and the called stored procedure is owned by the **dbo** user, the usual execute permission checks are bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The core issue is the lack of proper permission verification when a stored procedure owned by **dbo** is executed from within a temporary stored procedure within databases owned by the **sa** account.
*   **Bypassed Security:** Normal permission checks are bypassed, allowing a user to execute a stored procedure that they should not have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Code Execution:** A malicious user can execute stored procedures that they are not authorized to run, potentially leading to a variety of unauthorized actions.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could perform tasks such as modifying or deleting database records.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers could potentially add or remove users, or otherwise manage the database beyond their intended access level by exploiting stored procedure vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Temporary Stored Procedures:** The vulnerability is triggered through the creation and execution of a temporary stored procedure by a malicious user. This temporary procedure then calls a stored procedure owned by **dbo** within the context of a database owned by **sa**, bypassing permission checks.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be able to authenticate to the SQL Server and have user access to the target database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the affected SQL Server or MSDE database.
*   **Database Access:** The attacker must have user access to the database where the targeted stored procedure resides.
*   **Knowledge of Stored Procedures:** The attacker needs to be aware of the existence of stored procedures owned by **dbo** that they wish to execute.
*   **Ability to create temporary stored procedure:** The attacker needs to be able to create temporary stored procedures.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only affects databases owned by the **sa** login account.
*   System databases, which are owned by **sa** by default and contain documented system stored procedures, are also susceptible.
*   The provided document includes a patch to address this vulnerability which ensures proper execute permissions checks for stored procedures.
