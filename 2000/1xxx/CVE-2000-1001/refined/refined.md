Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the price of items in the Element InstantShop is submitted as a hidden field within the order form. This design allows users to modify the price before submitting the form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Client-side price manipulation:** The application trusts client-side data for the price, without server-side validation.
- **Hidden field manipulation:** The use of hidden HTML input fields for price makes it easy for attackers to alter the price by modifying the form data before submission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Price manipulation:** Attackers can change the price of items to zero, a negative value, or any arbitrary value.
- **Financial loss:** This could lead to significant financial losses for the online store.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local modification:** The attacker saves a local copy of the order form, modifies the 'price' hidden field, and submits the modified form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic web knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of how to save and modify HTML forms.
- **Normal access to the application:** No elevated privileges are required; a regular user can exploit this vulnerability.
