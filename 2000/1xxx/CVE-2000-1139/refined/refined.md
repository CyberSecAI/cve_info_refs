- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Early shipments of Exchange 2000 included a user account (EUSR_EXSTOREEVENT) created during setup with a known username and password. This account was intended to be removed, but due to a production error, it remained in some early shipments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the presence of a user account with a known username and password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user who learns the credentials can remotely log into the Exchange server. On a member server, they gain user privileges, enabling them to run code of their choice. If Exchange is installed on a domain controller, the attacker gains domain user privileges, allowing access to other resources and the potential for further damage. While the account does not have administrative privileges or access to Exchange data, user-level access can be exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote login using the known username and password for the EUSR_EXSTOREEVENT account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to know the username and password of the EUSR_EXSTOREEVENT account. They also need network access to the affected Exchange server.
