Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `srv_paraminfo()` API, used by extended stored procedures (XPs) in Microsoft SQL Server to parse input parameters. The API does not validate the size of the buffer provided by the XP, leading to potential buffer overflows if the supplied buffer is too small for the parameter being parsed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `srv_paraminfo()` API. When an XP calls this function, it passes a buffer to store the parameter. If the parameter is larger than the provided buffer, a buffer overflow occurs.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `srv_paraminfo()` API does not check the length of the buffer provided by the calling XP. It assumes the XP has provided a buffer of sufficient size, which is not always the case.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the buffer with random data, an attacker can cause the SQL Server service to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the buffer is overflowed with carefully crafted data, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the SQL Server service account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct SQL Server Attack:** An attacker can directly connect to the SQL server (assuming they can authenticate) and call a vulnerable XP with a crafted long parameter to trigger the overflow.
- **Web Application Attack:** An attacker can potentially exploit a web application that uses a vulnerable XP by providing specially crafted input that eventually flows to the XP. This requires detailed knowledge of the web application and is less likely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **SQL Server Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access and authenticate to the SQL Server instance. This could be a standard database login or, less likely, through a compromised web application that uses SQL server as a backend.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable XPs:** The attacker needs to know which XPs are vulnerable to this specific buffer overflow.
- **Ability to Provide Large Input Parameters:** The attacker must have the ability to provide a sufficiently large input parameter to the vulnerable XP to trigger the overflow.
- **Optional: Knowledge of system internals to craft arbitrary code:** To achieve arbitrary code execution, the attacker needs a deep understanding of the system architecture to craft specific code that will be executed on the server.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable XPs are `xp_displayparamstmt`, `xp_enumresultset`, `xp_showcolv`, and `xp_updatecolvbm`.
- These XPs are exported by `xprepl.dll`.
- The code runs in the context of the SYSTEM account.
- The overflow can overwrite the saved return address and redirect execution to attacker-controlled code. The advisory also points out that finding a direct 'jmp eax' or 'call eax' was not possible and a 'call esi' was used instead where the attacker could place their shellcode.
- The vendor patch addresses the issue by ensuring that all default XPs allocate a correctly sized buffer before calling `srv_paraminfo()`.
