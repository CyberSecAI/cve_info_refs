## sysback makes call to hostname without a fully qualified path specification

#### Vulnerability Note VU#17566

Original Release Date: 2000-12-12 | Last Revised: 2000-12-12

---

### Overview

*sysback*, shipped with AIX systems, allows local users to gain root access because of a failure to use a fully qualified path for a call to *hostname*.

### Description

| sysback includes a call to *hostname* but does not include a full path specification. Because sysback is set uid root, intruders can put a malicious *hostname* in the path before the "real" *hostname*, and thereby execute any commands with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Impact

| Local users can execute arbitrary commands and programs with root privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Update to sysback.rte 4.2.1.13 as described in the IBM vendor statement. |
| --- |

| Remove setuid root from *sysback* in environments that permit it (where such a change would not be detrimental to operations). |
| --- |
