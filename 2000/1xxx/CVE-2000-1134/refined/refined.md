  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2000-1134": {
      "details": "The vulnerability lies in how various shells (sh) handle input redirection using the '<<' operator. When using '<<', /bin/sh creates a temporary file in /tmp with a name based on the process ID. It writes the input to this file and then closes it before reopening it as the standard input for the command. However, the shell does not check for errors during creat(), write(), or open() calls. This allows a malicious local user to interfere with the process.",
      "root_cause": "Insecure creation of temporary files with predictable names in /tmp by the shell when using the '<<' redirection operator, combined with missing error checks during file creation, writing, and opening.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure temporary file creation",
        "Predictable temporary file names",
         "Missing error handling during file operations"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can manipulate the temporary file used for input redirection. This can lead to:\n    - **Data alteration**: Another user can alter the content read from the temporary file.\n    - **Command injection:** By creating a FIFO (named pipe) in place of the temporary file, an attacker can insert additional commands to be executed by the shell.\n    - **Denial of Service**: Creating the file beforehand or creating a symbolic link named as the temporary file can block execution or lead to file corruption, respectively.",
     "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system is required.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the same system as the vulnerable shell process and must be able to create files in the /tmp directory.",
