- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "crash" utility within the ManTrap software allows an attacker to view all processes outside of the cage (honeypot). This is due to the way processes are managed within the caged environment.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Information disclosure: An attacker can view processes running on the host system outside of the emulated environment.
    - Process manipulation:  The attacker can obtain PIDs of processes outside the cage, enabling them to potentially kill those processes.
    - Logging disruption:  By killing specific Mantrap processes (rti_???), the attacker can disable logging functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Information leakage about the host system.
    - Denial of service through killing processes on the host system.
    - Hiding malicious activity by disabling logging within the honeypot.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploiting the "crash" utility within the ManTrap software from within the emulated/caged environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to gain access to the emulated/caged environment of the ManTrap software.
