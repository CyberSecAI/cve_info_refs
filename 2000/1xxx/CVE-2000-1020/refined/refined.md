- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the Mdaemon Worldclient (TCP port 3000) and Mdaemon Webconfig (TCP port 3001) web services. The vulnerability is triggered by a specific type of request sent to these services. This is a general issue in how Mdaemon handles certain URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The immediate impact is a denial of service (DoS), causing the service to crash with a Dr. Watson access violation. There's a possibility, due to the heap overflow overwriting several registers in a LocalSystem owned process, that it could be further exploited for privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specific, crafted request to the vulnerable Mdaemon web services on TCP ports 3000 or 3001.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Mdaemon web services. No specific positioning is mentioned.
