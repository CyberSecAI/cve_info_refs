- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to forcibly invoke the `ServletExec` servlet by prefixing the path with `/servlet/` in the URL. When invoked, this servlet attempts to re-initialize and bind a server thread on port 80, which results in a `java.net.BindException` and terminates the servlet engine if the port is already in use.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Forced servlet invocation due to lack of proper access controls or input validation, leading to a denial of service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the ServletExec servlet engine to terminate abruptly, leading to a denial of service. While the web server itself remains unaffected, the application functionality relying on the servlet engine becomes unavailable.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the server, including the `/servlet/ServletExec` path, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The request can be sent using tools like `nc` or even via a web browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker can be unauthenticated and can be located anywhere with network access to the webserver hosting the vulnerable ServletExec instance.
