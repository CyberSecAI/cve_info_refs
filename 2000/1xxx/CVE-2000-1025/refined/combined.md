Description

        Unify's eWave ServletExec is a JSP and a Java Servlet engine
        which is to be used as a plug-in to popular web servers like
        Apache, IIS, Netscape, etc.

        It is possible to send a URL request which causes the
        ServletExec servlet engine to terminate abruptly. The web
        server, however, is not affected.

Details

        It is possible to forcibly invoke any servlet by prefixing
        the path to servlet with "/servlet/" in the URL. A servlet
        called "ServletExec" is present in the server side classes.

        Invoking the "ServletExec" servlet via forced servlet
        invocation causes the servlet engine to re-initialize and
        attempt to bind a server thread on port 80. If the server is
        already running, the port binding causes an exception and
        the servlet engine terminates abruptly.

        For example, if ServletExec is running on 10.0.0.1 as a plug-
        in to a web server on port 80, an attacker can open a
        connection to port 80 and make the following GET request that
        causes the servlet engine to terminate abruptly.

        nc 10.0.0.1 80
        GET /servlet/ServletExec HTTP/1.0

        Or simply access the URL <http://10.0.0.1/servlet/ServletExec>
        from a browser to the same effect.

        ServletExec generates java.net.BindException and kills the
        servlet engine.

        The following gets recorded in the log file:

        Received an exception when starting ServletExec:
java.net.BindException:
        Address in use: bind

Solution

        Upgrade to ServletExec version 3.0E, available at:

        <http://www.servletexec.com/downloads/>

        Please contact the vendor for further details at
        info@unify.com or Unify Sales at 1-800-248-6439
