- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple buffer handling problems in the FTP, TELNET, and LPD services, and a vulnerability in the JetDirect IP implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflows in FTP, TELNET, and LPD services, and a malformed packet vulnerability in the JetDirect IP implementation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Service crashes, printer initiating a firmware upgrade based on random garbage in memory, and permanent crashes requiring a new firmware burn.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malformed packets to the printer's IP address. Specifically crafted packets targeting the FTP, TELNET, and LPD services can trigger the buffer overflows. A specific malformed packet can trigger the IP implementation vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the printer. The attacker can spoof the source IP of the malicious packet.
