Based on the provided document, here's the information related to CVE-2000-1104:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a variant of a Cross-Site Scripting (CSS) vulnerability.
- Certain web services in Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) do not properly validate user inputs before using them to generate dynamic web pages.
- This lack of input validation allows malicious users to inject scripts into web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation in IIS web services.
- Susceptibility to Cross-Site Scripting (CSS) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious user can inject and execute arbitrary script code on a user's machine within the context of a trusted website.
- This script can perform actions with the same privileges as the trusted site.
- The malicious script can be made persistent, running again if the user returns to the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can lure a user to a malicious website.
- The malicious website crafts a hyperlink that, when clicked, sends a request to a vulnerable IIS server containing malicious script as part of the input to a web service.
- The vulnerable IIS server processes the malicious script within the request and sends it back to the user.
- The user's browser executes the malicious script received from the vulnerable website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create a malicious website and lure users to click on a crafted link.
- The attacker needs to identify a website running vulnerable versions of Microsoft Internet Information Server.

**Additional Notes**
- This document describes the vulnerability as a variant of previously identified CSS issues, and the provided patch protects against the original vulnerability and the new variant.
- The document also emphasizes that the vulnerability stems from server-side software issues, not browser-related weaknesses.
- Static websites are not vulnerable to this issue.
