Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2000-1087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `srv_paraminfo()` API, which is used by Extended Stored Procedures (XPs) in Microsoft SQL Server to parse input parameters.
- `srv_paraminfo()` does not validate the length of the buffer provided by the XP before copying the parameter data into it, trusting that the calling XP has allocated a large enough buffer.
- Vulnerable XPs fail to properly check the size of the parameter before calling `srv_paraminfo()`, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow. When an overly long string is passed as a parameter to a vulnerable XP, `srv_paraminfo()` writes past the end of the allocated buffer, overwriting adjacent memory.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The vulnerable XPs lack proper input validation and do not check the size of the input parameters before using `srv_paraminfo()`.
- **Trusting API Design:** The design of `srv_paraminfo()` trusts the calling program to allocate a large enough buffer without providing a mechanism for the API to know the buffer's size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By overflowing the buffer with random data, an attacker can cause the SQL Server service to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker can overwrite critical parts of memory, including the exception handler's saved return address, and execute arbitrary code in the security context of the SQL Server service account.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct SQL Server Access:** An attacker who can authenticate to the SQL Server can directly call vulnerable extended stored procedures and supply malicious parameters.
- **Web Application Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability through a web application that interacts with the SQL Server. They would need to provide specific inputs to the web application that would cause the vulnerable XP to be called with an overly long parameter. This scenario is less likely because XPs are rarely called directly by web applications.
- **Compromised Web Server:** An attacker who has already compromised a web server and gained access to the SQL Server as a user can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **SQL Server Access:** The attacker needs some level of access to the SQL Server, either through direct authentication or via a compromised web server that uses the SQL Server.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable XPs:** The attacker needs to know which extended stored procedures are vulnerable to this buffer overflow.
- **Technical Skills:** Exploitation of this vulnerability requires some technical expertise in crafting malicious parameters to cause the overflow and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Specific Vulnerable Extended Stored Procedures (from marc.info content):**

-   `xp_peekqueue` (xpqueue.dll)
-   `xp_printstatements` (xprepl.dll)
-   `xp_proxiedmetadata` (xprepl.dll) - CVE-2000-1087 is specifically associated with this XP.
-   `xp_SetSQLSecurity` (xpstar.dll)

**Additional Notes:**

- The `docs.microsoft.com` content provides more detailed explanation of the root cause and how the patch works. The patch modifies the vulnerable XPs to pre-allocate a buffer of the appropriate size before calling `srv_paraminfo()`.
- The advisory from `@stake` assigns  `CAN-2000-1087` to `xp_proxiedmetadata` while the Microsoft Security Bulletin assigns  `CAN-2000-1087` to `xp_proxiedmetadata` as well.
