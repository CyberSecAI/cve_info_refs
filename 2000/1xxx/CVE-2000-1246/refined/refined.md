The provided content is related to CVE-2000-1246.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a buffer overflow in the NWFTPD.NLM FTP server. Specifically, certain lengthy commands submitted by FTP clients (both authenticated and anonymous) could cause the command buffer to overflow, leading to stack corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: The FTP server's command buffer is vulnerable to overflow by excessively long commands.
- Stack corruption: Overflowing the command buffer can corrupt the stack, resulting in unpredictable behavior and potential crashes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Exploiting the vulnerability can lead to the termination of individual FTP session threads.
- System instability: In severe cases, the vulnerability can cause a system-wide crash requiring a server restart.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious FTP commands over the network.
- FTP Client: Both authenticated and anonymous FTP clients can be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable FTP server is required.
- Ability to send crafted FTP commands.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in NWFTPD.NLM v5.10.02, released on March 9, 2011.
- Prior releases, particularly NWFTPD.NLM 5.10.01 and earlier, were vulnerable to the same buffer overflow with different root causes.
- The fix involves preventing lengthy commands from overflowing the command buffer.
