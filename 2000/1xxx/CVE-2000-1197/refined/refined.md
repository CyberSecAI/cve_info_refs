- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The POP3 server uses the same temporary filename in the `/tmp` directory for each user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** If a temporary file with the same name already exists (especially if owned by a different user), the POP3 server incorrectly assumes the mailbox is locked, denying legitimate access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS). A malicious user can create the temporary file in `/tmp`, preventing legitimate users from accessing their mailboxes.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A malicious user creates a file in `/tmp` with the same name that the POP3 server uses as a temporary file for mailbox locking.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to create files in the `/tmp` directory. This could be a local user, or in some cases possibly a remote user if a misconfigured service allows it.
