Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-1209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is that Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) are shipped with a null (empty) default password for the administrative account "sa".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Default Credentials:** The primary weakness is the use of a null default password for the "sa" administrative account.
- **Lack of Forced Password Change:** The software does not force users to set a password for the "sa" account upon installation or first use.
- **Mixed Mode Security:** When installed in mixed mode, the "sa" account is created without a password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can easily gain unauthorized access to the database server using the "sa" account with a null password.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Once authenticated, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system via procedures like `xp_cmdshell()`, typically with the privileges of the account running the SQL services which is often "NT Authority\System", leading to a full system compromise.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Attackers can read, modify, or delete data stored in the SQL server.
- **System Compromise:** Full system compromise is possible due to the elevated privileges associated with the SQL service account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access (Port 1433):** The vulnerability is exploitable via network access to the SQL Server on TCP/UDP port 1433.
- **Direct Database Connections:** Direct connections to the database can be made using the default "sa" account credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** Attackers must have network connectivity to the target SQL Server.
- **Knowledge of Default Credentials:** Attackers must be aware of the default null password for the "sa" account.
- **Ability to Connect to Port 1433:** Attackers need to be able to establish a connection on port 1433 which the SQL service runs on by default.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Microsoft SQL Server and MSDE, the latter often being included as part of other software installations.
- The issue was known as early as 2000-08-10 but was first published on 2001-11-27.
- Tumbleweed's Secure Mail (MMS) versions 4.3, 4.5, and 4.6 were identified as vulnerable under the default configuration since they bundled MSDE.
- A patch was released by Tumbleweed in version 4.7
- Microsoft SQL Server 2000 prompts for a password but permits a blank password if entered, therefore not addressing the vulnerability.
- The CERT/CC specifically mentioned interest in reports related to the "Kaiten" or "SQL Worm Spida" activity
