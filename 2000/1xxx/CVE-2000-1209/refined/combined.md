## Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) ship with a null default password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#635463

Original Release Date: 2001-11-27 | Last Revised: 2002-06-20

---

### Overview

[Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp) and [Microsoft Data Engine](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/off2000/html/acconAboutMSDE.asp) ship with a null default password on the administrative account *sa*. If the system administrator does not set the password, the system may be vulnerable to attack.

### Description

| [Microsoft SQL Server (MS SQL)](http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.asp) and [Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/off2000/html/acconAboutMSDE.asp) ship without a default password on the administrative account *sa*, permitting unauthorized access via port 1433 TCP/UDP. As long as the server has a null password, gaining access to the *sa* account is trivial. While it may not be enabled under a default configuration, MSDE ships as a component of several applications such as Microsoft Office 2000 and Tumbleweed's [Secure Mail (MMS)](http://www.tumbleweed.com/en/products/solutions/protect_enterprise/mail.html). Tumbleweed's Secure Mail (MMS) Releases 4.3, 4.5, and 4.6 all ship with MSDE enabled and are vulnerable under the default configuration. A [patch](http://thompson.tumbleweed.com/NewKB/bulletin/UPFiles/sa-official.htm) has been released to address this vulnerability on these versions of MMS and incorporated into the release of 4.7.  If the registry key HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\MSSQLServer is defined, then you have MS SQL Server or MSDE installed. You should check to see if the *sa* account exists and ensure that a password is set. Instructions to change the password are located at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/ en-us/modadmin/html/deconchangingsqlserveradministratorlogin.asp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/modadmin/html/deconchangingsqlserveradministratorlogin.asp) [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/ en-us/adminsql/ad\_1\_server\_5un8.asp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/adminsql/ad_1_server_5un8.asp)An NT administrator has the option to install MS SQL or MSDE with integrated security or in mixed mode. If you select integrated security you are not vulnerable; however, when mixed mode is chosen, the *sa* account is created without a password. For more information about this selection and how to change the password in mixed mode, please see [http://www.microsoft.com/Office/techinfo/productdoc/2002/ en/access/AboutEnablingMixedModeSecurityInAnAc.htm](http://www.microsoft.com/Office/techinfo/productdoc/2002/en/access/AboutEnablingMixedModeSecurityInAnAc.htm)<http://www.microsoft.com/sql>It should be noted that when installing Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (formerly MSDE), the application prompts for an *sa* password. If a blank password is entered, Microsoft SQL Server 2000 will display a warning but permit a blank password.The CERT/CC is interested in receiving reports related to the "Kaiten" or "SQL Worm Spida" activity. If machines under your administrative control are compromised, please send mail to cert@cert.org with the following text included in the subject line: "[CERT#38873]". |
| --- |

### Impact

| Through the use of various procedures such as xp\_cmdshell(), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system with whatever user privileges the Microsoft SQL services are running under. This is typically a user with "NT Authority\System". |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Set a password for your SQL Server on the** ***sa*** **adminitration account.**Following best practices, passwords should never be left at their default value. Ensure that a password has been assigned to the *sa* account on MS-SQL servers under your control. |
