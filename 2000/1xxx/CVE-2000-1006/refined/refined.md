- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of invalid values in MIME header fields by Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5. Specifically, a certain type of invalid data in MIME headers causes the Exchange service to fail.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way Exchange Server parses MIME headers of incoming emails. When it encounters a specific type of invalid value, the service crashes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, rendering the Exchange server unavailable. The Exchange service will fail and stop processing emails.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is sending a specially crafted email with malformed MIME headers to a vulnerable Exchange server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs the ability to send emails to the targeted Exchange server. No special privileges on the server or network are required.
