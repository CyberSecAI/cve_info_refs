- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unchecked buffer in the Phone Book Service when processing requests for phone book updates. A malformed URL can trigger a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the Phone Book Service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can execute arbitrary code on a remote server running the vulnerable service. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Gain privileges equivalent to the IUSR_machinename account (IIS 4) or the IWAM_machinename account (IIS 5).
    - Add, change, or delete data.
    - Run existing code on the server.
    - Upload and execute new code.
    - Cause the Phone Book Service to crash (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted, malformed HTTP request for a phone book update to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an IIS server running the Phone Book Service. This server may be reachable via the internet or a RAS/PPTP server. The Phone Book Service is not installed by default. The service needs to be specifically installed by the administrator on the IIS server.
