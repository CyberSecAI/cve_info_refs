Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-1034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an unchecked buffer in the Microsoft System Monitor ActiveX control (sysmon.ocx), specifically in the handling of the "LogFileName" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The ActiveX control fails to validate the length of the "LogFileName" parameter, allowing an attacker to supply an overly long string and overwrite adjacent memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow data, an attacker can overwrite return addresses or other critical data, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Denial of Service:** Overwriting memory with random data can cause the application (Internet Explorer, Outlook, or Outlook Express) to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Full System Compromise:** The attacker's code runs with the privileges of the user, so an administrator user could have their system fully compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based:** A malicious website can embed the vulnerable ActiveX control with a crafted "LogFileName" parameter. When a user visits the website with ActiveX enabled, the exploit occurs.
- **Email-based:** An attacker can send a specially crafted HTML email containing the vulnerable ActiveX control and the malicious "LogFileName". When a user opens the email (with ActiveX enabled), the exploit is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to:
    - Create a malicious web page or send a crafted HTML email.
    - Have the victim browse to the malicious web page or open the crafted HTML email.
- The victim must:
    - Have ActiveX controls enabled in their browser (IE) or email client (Outlook, Outlook Express).
    - The user must be browsing or reading mail in a security zone that allows ActiveX controls to run.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by USSR Labs.
- The vulnerable ActiveX control has the CLSID: C4D2D8E0-D1DD-11CE-940F-008029004347.
- Microsoft released a patch to address this vulnerability (MS00-085)
- The patch checks the length of parameters before using them, preventing the buffer overflow.
- The provided "evil.html" demonstrates how to trigger the crash via a crafted `LogFileName` parameter.
- Security Zones and the Outlook Security Update are mitigating factors against exploitation.
