- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lotus Notes R5 clients do not properly validate S/MIME signed or encrypted emails.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Failure to warn users of broken S/MIME signatures when the email body has been modified.
    - Failure to display an appropriate warning message when an encrypted S/MIME email is corrupted, instead displaying a blank message.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can modify the content of a signed email without the recipient being warned of the tampering. The lack of warning could mislead users, particularly in situations where digital signatures are legally recognized.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker would need to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to intercept and modify the email in transit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify email traffic.
