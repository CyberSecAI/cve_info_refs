- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unchecked buffer in the Terminal Server login prompt when handling the user name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A classic buffer overflow vulnerability in the username field of the login prompt.
- **Impact of exploitation**: 
    - Successful exploitation could allow a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the Terminal Server, enabling them to add, change, or delete data, run existing code, or upload and run new code.
    - Failing successful code execution, exploitation could cause the Terminal Server to fail, leading to loss of connections and work in progress.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Remotely: By sending crafted data to the Terminal Server's login prompt, typically on TCP port 3389.
    - Locally: By exploiting the vulnerability at the local login prompt.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Remotely: Ability to send packets to the target Terminal Server on the designated port (default: TCP 3389). No prior authentication required.
    - Locally: Physical or direct access to the Terminal Server.
