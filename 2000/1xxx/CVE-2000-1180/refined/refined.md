- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow exists in the `cmctl` binary.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in the `cmctl` binary.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A local user can gain the privileges of the oracle user (euid=oracle) and the dba group (egid=dba), which owns all database files in a default installation.
- **Attack vectors:** Local users can exploit the vulnerability by providing a crafted input to the `cmctl` binary.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable `cmctl` binary is located.
