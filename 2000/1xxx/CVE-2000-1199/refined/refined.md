- **Root cause of vulnerability:** PostgreSQL stores user passwords in cleartext within the `pg_shadow` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext storage of passwords.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the `pg_shadow` file or compromises the 'postgres' user can obtain all usernames and passwords, leading to unauthorized access to all databases.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Direct access to the server's file system where the `pg_shadow` file is located.
    - Compromising the 'postgres' user account.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to read the `pg_shadow` file (requires root or postgres user privileges).
    - Compromise of the 'postgres' user account on the server.
