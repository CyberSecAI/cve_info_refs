Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2000-1039:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the implementation of the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT) protocol in Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95, 98, 98 Second Edition, and Windows Me.
*   Specifically, the affected systems have a flaw in how they handle certain malformed TCP/IP packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Handling:** The NBT implementation fails to properly process malformed TCP/IP packets, leading to resource exhaustion or system instability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service.
    *   **Temporary Service Interruption:** The most common effect is a temporary interruption of network services. The affected machine stops responding to client network requests, but resumes normal operation after the attack ceases.
    *   **System Hang:** In a less frequent scenario, the system may become completely unresponsive and require a reboot to restore functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The attack involves sending a stream of specially crafted, malformed TCP/IP packets to the target machine.
*   **Targeted Port:** The vulnerability can only be exploited if TCP port 139 is open on the target machine. This port is typically used for NetBIOS services, so systems with the Server service or File/Printer Sharing enabled are susceptible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable machine.
*   **Knowledge of NBT Protocol:** The attacker needs to be able to craft the malformed TCP/IP packets that trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Open TCP Port 139:** The target machine must have TCP port 139 open and accessible to the attacker. This implies that either the server service or File/Printer sharing must be enabled.
*   **Internet or Intranet Access:** The attacker could be located on the internet, if the vulnerable machine is directly connected to it, or from the internal network, if the machine is behind a firewall.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Windows 2000 is not affected by this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is not considered a traditional flooding attack, as it involves a "multiplier effect" where the attacker's resource usage is less than the impact on the target system.
*   Microsoft released a patch for Windows NT 4.0 to address this vulnerability.
*   For Windows 95, 98, 98 Second Edition, and Windows Me, Microsoft recommended disabling File and Printer Sharing as a workaround since no patch was released for these operating systems.
