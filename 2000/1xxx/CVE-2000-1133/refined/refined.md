Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is improper input validation within Authentix 100 when processing URLs. Specifically, the software fails to correctly handle URLs containing a dot (`.`) immediately after the protected directory name. This allows attackers to bypass the intended authentication mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Input Validation Failure:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of the URL, specifically the path, leading to a bypass of authentication controls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism provided by Authentix 100.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  Bypassing authentication allows unauthorized users to access protected resources, such as files and directories, that should normally require authentication.
- **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive information stored in the protected resources can be exposed to unauthorized users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious URL Crafting:** The attack vector is crafting a specially formed URL. This URL includes a dot (`.`) character immediately following the name of the protected directory, followed by the file name. Example: `<http://my.secured.server/protected-directory./filename.ext>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of the Target System:** The attacker needs to know the basic structure of the target system's URL, specifically the protected directory name, and a filename within that directory.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable server over the network (typically HTTP).
