Hi there,

Yesterday I posted an advisory concerning a bug in Authentix that would
allow users to bypass authentification. When I contacted the vendor about
this they were very responsive and after some emails going here and there
we agreed to postpone the bugtraq-posting for two weeks and give them time
to (among other things) create a part on their site explaining the issue.

I was moderately satisfied with the explanation-on-their-site part, that
way the details would be known anyway, though at a slower rate and everyone
would be happy..

But I haven't heard from them since, and I couldn't find a reference to the
issue on the site, and I still posted an incomplete advisory...

I want to set that right. I agree with vulnhelp that details will be known
eventually, and because the exploit is so very simple it can't take long,
so why not share it right away, so we all know what's going on, and can act
upon it...

Here goes:

As mentioned in the advisory (bugtraq-ID 1907), Authentix provides a way to
protect pages from unauthorized views.. But by providing a specially formed
URL you won't be prompted for your username and password.

Normally, after logging in, and after being redirected to your part of the
site, the URL looks like this:

<http://my.secured.server/protected-directory/filename.ext>

By giving a URL in the form:

<http://my.secured.server/protected-directory./filename.ext> (place a dot
after the shieldeddirectory AND provide a direct filename)

there's a good change you will be able to view the protected pages anyway.

In most cases a filename isn't that hard to guess (index.html, default.htm,
whatever), and with a little searching and guessing the name of the
protected-directory can be found in the same way...

It seems it does not work for everything, for example, when I found out
about this, images wouldn't show.. There seem to be some other limitations,
but I could not fit them in a "general rule" so quickly.. Neither ASP or
this kind of windows programming are in my expertise area, work/life goes
on, and Flicks Software was very responsive at that time, so I didn't look
into it any further...

Hope this make it a little clearer...

with regards,

Lisa Saarloos

Security advisory: Authentix100
Release Date: 1 november 2000
Vendor: Flicks Software (<http://www.flicks.com>)

** Product Description

Authentix is a Windows-based product that offers cookie/form-based or 100%
cookie-free "Basic Authentication" website protection while keeping NT
Users Names and Passwords private. It protects all files, not just ASP
pages. It can validate against an internal database, a text file or an
external ODBC datasource. It requires Windows NT or Windows 2000 and IIS.

More information on Authentix can be found on
<http://www.flicks.com/authentix100/>

** Versions affected

All versions prior to version 5.3.
To check your current version number, start Authentix from the Start
Menu/Flicks Software, and look in the About box.

** Problem description

By using special characters in the URL combined with some special
circumstances it is possible to bypass the authentification mechanism of
Authentix100, thus not receiving a login-prompt. This allows arbitrary
users to view information that was not intented to be seen by them.

** Patch availability

Knowing the importance that Authentix100 plays in authentification methods,
Flicks Software has released version 5.3 of Authentix100.

All users of Authentix100 are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the latest
version of Authentix100 at
<http://www.flicks.com/authentix100>
This upgrade, similar to the cost of the original product, is FREE.

** Technical support and contact

Please direct ALL questions regarding this issue to Scott Gordon at
scott@flicks.com. Emailing your questions will allow us to address your
concerns in the fastest manner possible.

** Credits

This bug was originally brought to the attention of Flicks Software by Lisa
Saarloos. She would like to thank Flicks Software for there cooperation in
resolving this issue and their prompt and kind response.
