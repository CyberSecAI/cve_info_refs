```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The Netopia ISDN Router 650-ST allows access to system logs (device history and WAN history) through specific key combinations at the telnet login prompt, without requiring prior authentication.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Authentication bypass: System logs can be accessed before authentication.
- Information disclosure: Sensitive information, like usernames and passwords, could be present in the logs.

Impact of exploitation:
- Unauthorized access to potentially sensitive information in device logs.

Attack vectors:
- Telnet access to the router.
- Pressing Ctrl-F or Ctrl-E at the telnet login prompt.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Network access to the device via telnet.
