Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Poll It v2.0:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The primary vulnerability lies in the way Poll It v2.0 handles CGI variables. It uses the `ReadForm` function to convert CGI variables into Perl variables *after* some internal script variables have already been defined. This allows an attacker to overwrite these internal variables by passing specially crafted CGI variables. Additionally, an insecure `open()` function call allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection:** The `open(COPTIONS,"$poll_options");` line is vulnerable because the `$poll_options` variable is not sanitized. By injecting a pipe character (`|`) followed by a command, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands.
2.  **Administrative Bypass:** The `$admin_password` variable is defined *before* the `ReadForm` function is called, allowing an attacker to overwrite the password via a crafted URL like `<http://www.example.com/><cgi dir>/pollit.cgi?load=admin&entered_password=foo&admin_password=foo`, thus accessing administrative functions without knowing the actual password.
3. **Information Disclosure:**  The `pollit_files/ips.txt` file, containing IP addresses of voters, is world-readable and can be downloaded, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting shell commands via the `poll_options` variable, leading to complete system compromise.
2.  **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain administrative access to the Poll It script, potentially defacing the website or performing other malicious actions.
3.  **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access the `ips.txt` file, potentially revealing private information about users.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **HTTP GET Request:** Attackers craft malicious URLs with specific query parameters to exploit the vulnerabilities. For example:
    *   Command injection: `<http://www.example.com/><cgi-dir>/pollit.cgi?admin_password=foo&entered_password=foo&action=add_option&add_option=1&=poll_options=echo+0wned>/tmp/hacked|`
    *   Admin bypass: `<http://www.example.com/><cgi dir>/pollit.cgi?load=admin&entered_password=foo&admin_password=foo`
2. **Direct File Access:** The `ips.txt` file can be accessed via a direct web request.  For example: `<http://www.example.com/><dir of pollit cgi>/pollit_files/ips.txt`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Poll It CGI script.
*   No prior authentication is needed to exploit the command injection or admin bypass vulnerabilities. The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special permissions.
*   For the information disclosure vulnerability, the attacker needs to know the location of the `pollit_files` directory.
