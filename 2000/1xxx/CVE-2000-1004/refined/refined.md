The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, but only one of them is relevant to CVE-2000-1004. The content refers to format string vulnerabilities in `fstat`, `eeprom`, `su`, `talkd` and `photurisd` programs on OpenBSD.

Based on the CVE description, CVE-2000-1004 is about a format string vulnerability in `fstat`, hence the exploit below is relevant.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `fstat` program is vulnerable to a format string vulnerability. This occurs because the program uses user-supplied input directly as a format string in `printf` or similar functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Format string vulnerability in `fstat`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution can be achieved by overwriting return addresses on the stack.
- The provided exploit uses format string vulnerability to overwrite a return address on the stack, with the intention of executing shellcode.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker provides a specially crafted format string as an argument to `fstat`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable `fstat` program.
- The provided exploit seems to be for local exploitation, but other exploits might exist.

**Additional details from the content:**
- The content includes source code for a working exploit targeting OpenBSD 2.7 on i386. The exploit demonstrates how to overwrite a return address on the stack to execute injected shellcode.
- The vulnerability is present because `fstat` takes user input and processes it directly using format specifiers, making it vulnerable to format string exploits.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying the crafted format string as a command line argument to the fstat program.
