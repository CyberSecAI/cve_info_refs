The provided content describes a vulnerability in Resin ServletExec versions 1.2 (and possibly 1.1) when used with Apache on Windows (specifically, a Simplified Chinese version of Windows 2000).

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when handling HTTP requests for JSP files. Specifically, the software doesn't properly sanitize special characters in the URL.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The core vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By appending characters like ".." or their URL-encoded versions (%2e.., %81, %82, ...%fe) to a JSP file request, the servlet engine can be tricked into directly displaying the source code of the JSP file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within JSP pages, potentially exposing application logic, database credentials, and other sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is via crafted HTTP requests. Specifically, appending ".." or URL-encoded versions to the JSP filename in the requested URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the server other than being able to communicate over the network.
