- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `SNMP.EXE` process when processing overly long GET strings via the `OverView5` CGI interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The `OverView5` CGI interface within HP Openview Network Node Manager v6.1 fails to properly validate the length of the input string, leading to a buffer overflow when a GET request with a string of 136 bytes or longer is sent to the web service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can overwrite the EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer) register, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `OverView5.exe` CGI interface with an oversized string in the `Oid` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running HP Openview Network Node Manager v6.1. The default web service runs on port 80.
