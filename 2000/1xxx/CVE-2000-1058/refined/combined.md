I. Description
============================================================================

Vendor URL: <http://www.openview.hp.com/>

Delphis Consulting Internet Security Team (DCIST) discovered the following
vulnerability in HP Openview Node Manager under Windows NT.

Severity: high

By using the OverView5 CGI interface which is shipped and installed by
default with HPOpenView network node manager it is possible to cause a
BufferOverRun in SNMP.EXE. This is done be connecting to port 80 which the
WWW service resides on by default and sending a large GET string. The string

has to be a length of 132 + EIP (4 bytes making a total of 136 bytes). This
will cause the above application to BufferOverRun over writing EIP.

Example: (URL will be wrapped)
<http://127.0.0.1/OvCgi/OpenView5.exe?Context=Snmp&Action=Snmp&Host=&Oid=A0B>
