{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The line printer daemon (lpd) allows an attacker to pass options to sendmail.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "LPD does not properly sanitize input, allowing arbitrary options to be passed to sendmail.",
      "LPD does not properly validate the source of print requests, allowing unauthorized access.",
       "LPD allows the submission of arbitrary data files to the spool directory."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain root access by specifying a different configuration file for sendmail, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted print job to the LPD service, which includes a malicious sendmail configuration file and a control file with options to invoke sendmail with the malicious configuration."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to send print jobs to the LPD server."
      "The attacker needs to control the DNS to make their IP address reverse-resolve to the same hostname as the LPD server.",
    ],
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted data files and control files to the LPD server. This vulnerability is made worse by the fact that the LPD service does not restrict the number of data files sent to the spooler directory.  The LPD service also incorrectly uses the reversed resolved name to grant access, making it trivial for an attacker to gain access to the server if they can control DNS. The sendmail configuration file is sent as a data file and the configuration file path is sent as an argument to sendmail through the control file."
