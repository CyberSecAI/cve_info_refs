Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2000-1085:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how extended stored procedures (XPs) in Microsoft SQL Server handle input parameters. The `srv_paraminfo()` API, used by XPs to parse parameters, doesn't check the buffer size before copying data, leading to a potential buffer overflow. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when an XP does not properly validate the size of the buffer it provides to `srv_paraminfo()` before the API writes data into that buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `srv_paraminfo()` API when called by certain extended stored procedures (XPs).
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The XPs are not validating the size of input parameters before passing them to the `srv_paraminfo()` API.
- **Trusting Calling Program:** The `srv_paraminfo()` API trusts that the calling XP has allocated sufficient buffer size, which is not always the case.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious user can cause the SQL Server service to fail by overflowing the buffer with random data. This would require restarting the service.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the overflow data, a malicious user can potentially execute arbitrary code on the database server. This code would run with the privileges of the SQL Server service account.
- **Database compromise:** At minimum, the attacker could gain full control over the database, including add, change or delete data and run procedures.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Direct SQL Server Attack:** An attacker can try to log into the SQL Server and call a vulnerable XP directly. This would require successful authentication.
- **Web Application Attack:** An attacker could target a database server that acts as a backend for a web server. They would need detailed knowledge of the web application to craft inputs that reach a vulnerable XP.
- **Compromised Web Server:** An attacker who has already compromised a web server and has valid SQL Server credentials could use this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- To directly attack the SQL server, the attacker needs valid credentials to connect to the SQL server.
- For web application attack, in-depth knowledge of the web application and its interaction with the SQL server is required to craft inputs for exploiting this vulnerability.
- In the case of a compromised web server, the attacker would need to have gained user-level access to the SQL Server.

**Specific vulnerable extended stored procedures (from the @stake advisory):**

- `xp_peekqueue` (xpqueue.dll)
- `xp_printstatements` (xprepl.dll)
- `xp_proxiedmetadata` (xprepl.dll)
- `xp_SetSQLSecurity` (xpstar.dll)

The document also mentions that the fix involves modifying the XPs to allocate appropriately sized buffers before calling `srv_paraminfo()`. The document also mentions that any third-party XPs that call `srv_paraminfo()` also be checked to ensure that they do so correctly.
