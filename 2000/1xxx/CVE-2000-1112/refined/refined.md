- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to embed script programs within .WMS (Windows Media Player Skin) files. When a user selects a malicious skin, the embedded script can execute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the lack of security controls over the execution of scripts within .WMS files, allowing arbitrary code execution. Specifically, the ability to execute ActiveX controls, even those not marked safe for scripting, presents a significant security risk.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine within the security context of the user running Windows Media Player. This can lead to data compromise, misuse of existing software, downloading and executing additional malicious software, or other actions. The severity is dependent on the user's privileges. If the user is an administrator, the impact would be more severe.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - **Directly sending the malicious .WMS file**: An attacker could send the malicious skin file to a victim, attempting to trick the user into saving, installing and selecting the malicious skin and then running Windows Media Player.
    - **Hosting the malicious .WMS file on a website**: An attacker could host the malicious file on a website and cause it to be installed and launched automatically when a victim visits the site. Alternatively, they could send an HTML email containing a link to the malicious file hosted on the website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious .WMS file with embedded script. They also need a way to deliver the malicious file to the victim, either by direct delivery or by hosting it on a website and tricking the user into accessing the site or opening a link.
