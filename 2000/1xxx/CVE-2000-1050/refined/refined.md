- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in how Allaire's JRun 3.0 handles URLs, specifically when a double forward slash `//` is present before the `WEB-INF` directory in the URL path. This allows access to the contents of the `WEB-INF` directory, which should be protected.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of URLs containing `//` before `WEB-INF` in the path. This bypasses the intended access restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can access sensitive files located within the `WEB-INF` directory, including configuration files like `web.xml` and `webapp.properties`, server-side components, class files, session information, and other application-related data. This can lead to information disclosure, potential compromise of application logic, and further attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request with a URL containing a double forward slash before `WEB-INF` (e.g., `<http://site.running.jrun:8100//WEB-INF/>`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable JRun server. No authentication or special privileges are needed, and the attacker can be remote.
