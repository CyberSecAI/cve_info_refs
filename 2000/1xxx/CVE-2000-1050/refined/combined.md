Description

        A severe security flaw exists with Allaire's JRun 3.0 allowing
        an attacker to access WEB-INF directories on the JRun 3.0
        server. The WEB-INF directory tree contains web application
        classes, pre-compiled JSP files, server side libraries,
        session information and files such as web.xml and
        webapp.properties.

Details

        JRun 3.0 can be made to run as a stand-alone web server on
        port 8100. The directory <jrun_install_dir>/servers/default
        holds different web applications hosted in it.

        The directory <jrun_install_dir>/servers/default/default-app
        is the web document root for the default web application. This
        application is mapped to <http://site.running.jrun:8100/>, if
        accesed via a web browser.

        Other web application directories are set up in a similar
        manner as follows:

           <jrun_install_dir>/servers/default/app1
           <jrun_install_dir>/servers/default/app2 ... etc.

        Their URLs would be mapped as:

           <http://site.running.jrun:8100/app1>,
           [http://site.running.jrun:8100/app2,...](http://site.running.jrun:8100/app2%2C...)

        and so on, depending on the configuration.

        Each web application directory contains a WEB-INF directory
        tree which contains configuration files, server side
        components, libraries and other application related
        information. This directory is not visible to the client. If
        the WEB-INF directory is requested by a web browser by the
        following URL:

           <http://site.running.jrun:8100/WEB-INF/>

        the server responds with a 403 Forbidden error code. However
        it is possible to access this directory via the following URL:

           <http://site.running.jrun:8100//WEB-INF/>

        This causes the entire directory tree under WEB-INF to be
        displayed and eventually files under this directory can be
        accessed. For example:

           <http://site.running.jrun:8100//WEB-INF/web.xml>
           <http://site.running.jrun:8100//WEB-INF/webapp.properties>

        would allow remote attackers to view the web.xml and
        webapp.properties in the WEB-INF directory. Attackers can also
        access critical resources such as class files, session
        information, etc.

Proof of concept

        Prefixing the path to WEB-INF by / in the URL causes the
        directory structure within WEB-INF to be displayed.

        <http://site.running.jrun:8100//WEB-INF/>

Solution

        Follow the recommendations given in Allaire Security Bulletin
        ASB00-27, available at: <http://www.allaire.com/security/>

Credits

        We would also like to thank Allaire Inc. for their prompt
        reaction to this problem and their co-operation in heightening
        security awareness in the security community.
