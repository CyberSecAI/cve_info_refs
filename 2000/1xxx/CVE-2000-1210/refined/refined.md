Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability in Apache Tomcat:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the presence of an example JSP file (`jsp/source.jsp`) included with Tomcat. This file, along with the `ShowSource.class` file, could be exploited to retrieve the contents of any file on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The `source.jsp` example allowed access to arbitrary files on the server, possibly through directory traversal techniques, although the exact method of how `source.jsp` did this is not fully explicit in this message
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows for the disclosure of sensitive file content that would not normally be accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could read any file on the server's file system that the Tomcat process has read permissions to. This could include configuration files, source code, database credentials, or other sensitive data, potentially leading to further compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the vulnerable `jsp/source.jsp` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable Tomcat application. No specific authentication is mentioned as being needed.

**Mitigation**
The fix was to remove the example jsp file or replace the `ShowSource.class` file. Additional code was added to prevent access to files outside the context of the resolution and to disallow `..` strings in the file paths.
