## lpd hostname authentication bypassed with spoofed DNS

#### Vulnerability Note VU#30308

Original Release Date: 2001-10-16 | Last Revised: 2001-11-09

---

### Overview

The line printer daemon enables various clients to share printers over a network. There exists a flaw in the authentication method in this daemon that permits remote access to the server.

### Description

| A vulnerability exists in the line printer daemon (lpd) shipped with the lpr package for several systems. The authentication method was not thorough enough. If a remote user was able to control their own DNS so that their IP address resolved to the hostname of the print server, access would be granted when it should not be. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An Intruder can gain unauthorized access to the lpd server. In conjunction with another vulnerability (e.g. [VU#39001](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/39001)), an intruder may be able to gain additional privileges. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Apply the patches provided by your vendor. |
