We gave three examples of RewriteRules and stated that only the first was vulnerable:  ```  RewriteRule    /test/(.*)        /usr/local/data/test-stuff/$1 RewriteRule    /more-icons/(.*)  /icons/$1 RewriteRule    /go/(.*)          http://www.apacheweek.com/$1  ```  This was incorrect, as both the first and second examples are vulnerable. The security problem has been fixed in Apache 1.3.14   ---  Apache 1.3.14 Released Apache 1.3.14 was released on 13th October 2000 and is now the latest version of the Apache server. The previous release was 1.3.12, released on the 25th February 2000. [See what was new in Apache 1.3.12](http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/00-02-25#apache1312). Apache 1.3.13 was never released.  Apache 1.3.14 is available in source form for compiling on Unix or Windows, for download from the [main Apache site](http://www.apache.org/dist/) or shortly from any [mirror download site](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi). Binary packages for some platforms are also available.  This is a bug fix and minor upgrade release, with a few new features. Users should upgrade if they have noticed particular bugs mentioned below or would like to use any of the new features.  Due to security issues any sites making use of the mass virtual hosting module `mod_vhost_alias` or `mod_rewrite` should upgrade to Apache 1.3.14.   Security vulnerabilities  * A security problem exists in the Rewrite module. Apache is   only vulnerable if you use mod\_rewrite and specific cases   of the `RewriteRule` directive. If the   destination of a RewriteRule contains regular expression   references then an attacker may be able to access any file   on the web server. * A security problem exists in the handling of Host: headers   in mass virtual hosting configurations. Under certain   circumstances an attacker may be able to access any file on   the web server * A security problem for users of the mass virtual hosting   module, `mod_vhost_alias`, causes the source to   a CGI to be sent if the `cgi-bin` directory is   under the document root   New features The main new features in 1.3.14 (compared to 1.3.12) are:   * Support a directory-based configuration system. If any of   the configuration directives point to directories instead   of files, all files in that directory (and in   subdirectories) will be also parsed as configuration files.   [PR#6397](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/6397) * Support name-based virtual hosting without needing to   specify an IP address in the Apache configuration file.   This enables sites that use dynamic IP address to support   name-based virtual hosting as well as allowing identical   machines to share a configuration file, say in a   load-balanced cluster. [PR#5595](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5595),   [PR#4455](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/4455) * An update to the bundled `dbmmanage` program to   add back group support, and overhaul the other commands to   add a comment argument * The `SetEnvIf` and `BrowserMatch`   range of directives can now be used in   `.htaccess` files. * The media types have been added to the default   `mime.types` file including filename extensions   for the WAP types. * An addition to the `htpasswd` tool allows   passwords to be generated and output to standard output   rather than a password file allowing the tool to be used to   generate passwords for inclusion into other types of   databases. * Administrators who are nervous about their full server   version details being public will be able to use the new   keyword `'ProductOnly'` in the   `ServerTokens` directive. When used, Apache will   only return the string "Apache" as the server version.   Sites such as the Netcraft in England make it easy for   anyone to [examine   what server](http://www.netcraft.com/whats/) sites are running. * The new digest authentication module,   `mod_auth_digest` has had a number of fixes and   upgrades applied. These include the ability to compile   using a C++ compiler, and alterations to the nonce to   potentially allow the sharing of authentication realms   across machines. * A number of code cleanups have been made to Apache. The   cleanups were originally contributed as [part of the patches from SGI](00-01-07#20plans) to   speed up Apache. Although the performance parts are not   going to become part of Apache 1.3, the minor fixes have   been applied.  The new features that apply only to Windows platforms are:  * Bundle the DBM package sdbm with Apache. sdbm is used by   default by `mod_auth_dbm` in the core Win32   distribution. sdbm support may be compiled into Apache on   other platforms in the future. * The Windows project files have been converted to work with   Microsoft Visual C 6.0. Scripts have been provided to allow   developers who only have access to MSVC 5.0 to use the new   files as they are not backward compatible. * Preparations for allowing Apache to be built using the free   bcc 5.5 compiler from Borland. * Windows 95 and 98 can now benefit from an emulation of NT   services, including install and uninstall options. The   Apache server therefore can start when the OS loads and   will not stop if the current user logs off. A handler for   Win32 Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break, Close, Logoff, and Shutdown has   been added. * A comprehensive review of the Windows documentation has   been committed which should reduce the number of support   enquiries and problem reports. * Numerous additions and fixes to the Windows service code   including cleaning up and testing the existing code,   allowing graceful restarts to a service, and the prevention   of starting multiple copies of a Windows 9x service with   the same name. * Hold open the console until manually closed in Windows if   the server fails to run, allowing any error message to be   read * Changes to the Windows build process to eliminate duplicate   references for exported libraries and remove libraries   included by Microsoft Visual C by default that are not   required.  Other platform-specific changes are:  * Support for the new FreeBSD accept filters feature. This   feature postpones the requirement for a child process to   handle a new connection until a HTTP request has arrived,   therefore increasing the number of connections that a given   number of child processes can handle * A number of alterations for the MPE platform including   fixing error reporting, updating the DSO code to be   compatible with a recent OS patch, refining user and group   management, and initial support for the proxy module * The default serialised accept has been changed for AIX 4.3   to provide a substantial performance improvement on   multiple CPU machines serving large numbers of concurrent   clients. * DSO support added for BS2000 and OS/390 USS platforms * A directory layout for Solaris 8 has been added to the   configuration system * The proxy module `mod_proxy` has been patched so   that it can be built on BeOS 4.5.2 * Updated configuration script to allow building on IBM's   IA-64 version of AIX   Bugs fixed The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.12 and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.14   * The `AddDefaultCharset` directive was being   incorrectly merged. [PR#5827](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5827) * The `Remove*` MIME directives were being   incorrectly merged. [PR#5597](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5597) * The expiry module, `mod_expires` would not   correctly merge its `Cache-Control` header. [PR#5769](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5769) * The proxy module, `mod_proxy` had a garbage   collection problem. [PR#1891](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/1891),   [PR#3278](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/3278),   [PR#4139](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/4139),   [PR#5997](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5997) * Apache ignores the case of a filename on platforms that   have case-insensitive file systems (such as Windows and   OS/2), however this causes problems for Java class files   published by WebDAV for example. * ApacheBench sends an authorisation header of "basic"   although the standard, RFC 2617, always refers to the   header as being "Basic". This causes problems with older   versions of PHP * Various problems with the digest authentication module,   `mod_auth_digest`. The fixes include: reworked   handling of the MD5 password hashing, ability for   independant servers to share the same realm, and fixes in   handling the Authorization header. * Compiling on OS/2 produces a few warning messages. * The benchmarking utility, ApacheBench (ab), would fail to   compile stand-alone. * The return value in an APXS error message was incorrectly   calculated. * The platform name used as part of the server version string   would incorrectly return "Unix" for BeOS machines. * Some versions of `sed` have a restriction   causing problems with APACI where   `"1,/<pattern>/"` commands start searching   for <pattern> at the 2nd line. * DSO loads fail with "permission denied" errors on AIX 4.1.5   due to changes made to support AIX 4.2 * Chunked encoding is broken on EBCDIC platforms due to the   recent changes in global handling of CRLF * The `ServerTokens` directive treats invalid   keywords as equivalent to 'Full'  Bugs now fixed that only affected the Windows platform include:  * The handling of '/' characters in URL parsing of directory   blocks is inconsistent. Using directives such as   `<Directory />` should match the root   directory of any drive for example * `mod_isapi` has a number of problems. The fixes   make ISAPI support for Apache more complete, but there are   still some discrepancies. * Win32 has a bug in network read select() that is noticed   specifically when using SSL enabled Apache and Server Gated   Cryptography certificates. Sometimes the SSL handshake does   not complete and the user sees a network error message. * The bundled dbmmanage script did not work correctly when   files contained groups. The seed calculation was incorrect   on windows platforms. [PR#3810](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/3810),   [PR#5527](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5527) * When Apache is run on Windows NT and 2000 messages sent to   stderr before Apache opens its own log files will be sent   to the Application Event Log * Ctrl+C is not treated as an interrupt on Windows 2000 * On Windows, only the local host name discovered by the IP   stack is treated as an 'undotted' private name. This causes   problems if no domain name can be identified. * A security hole on NT allows a user to view the listing of   a directory instead of the default HTML page by sending a   carefully constructed request. * The default ServerName on Windows platforms caused   confusion. [PR#5509](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5509),   [PR#5783](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5783),   [PR#5953](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5953),   [PR#5903](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5903),   [PR#5983](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5983),   [PR#5259](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5259),   [PR#5515](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5515),   [PR#5858](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5858) * The Windows and Unix default httpd.conf files have drifted   out of sync with each other * The proxy module, `mod_proxy` can not be   dynamically loaded on Windows 95. * Problems when handling service names that include spaces on   Windows NT platforms. * Apache did not change to the correct directory when   starting as a service on Windows, causing problems with   modules that loaded third-party DLLs (such as   `mod_dav`) * Proxying of HTTPS requests fail under Windows. [PR#2014](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/2014),   [PR#4680](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/4680),   [PR#5107](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5107),   [PR#5823](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/5823) * The proxy garbage collection routine on Windows NT fails to   open directories, causing many error messages to be logged.   [PR#3640](http://archive.apache.org/gnats/3640) * Apache on Windows was making assumptions about the default   shell (`cmd.exe` for NT,   `command.com` for others). Instead it should use   the `COMSPEC` environment variable. | | --- | | --- | |  |
