Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities in Poll It v2.0:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Pipe Injection in `open()` Function:** The primary vulnerability lies in the use of the `open()` function in line 94 of the `pollit.cgi` script: `open(COPTIONS,"$poll_options");`. The filename `$poll_options` is not sanitized and can be controlled by an attacker. Because the filename isn't prefixed with `<` or `>`, appending a pipe character `|` allows execution of shell commands.

*   **CGI Variable Overwriting:** In Poll It v2.0, the script uses the `ReadForm` function to convert CGI variables into Perl variables *after* some internal variables have been defined. This enables attackers to overwrite variables like `$poll_options`, `$admin_password` using CGI parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Command Injection via Pipe:** The `open()` call without proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject and execute shell commands by manipulating the `$poll_options` variable.

2.  **Administrative Access Bypass:** The `$admin_password` variable is defined before the `ReadForm()` function, which means the attacker can bypass authentication by setting `$admin_password` and `$entered_password` to the same value in the URL parameters.

3.  **Information Disclosure (IP addresses):** The `/pollit_files/ips.txt` file contains a list of IP addresses of voters, and it is directly accessible via a URL request, leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The pipe injection vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
*   **Administrative Control:** By bypassing the password check, attackers can access and potentially manipulate administrative functions of the Poll It script.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (voter IP addresses) can be accessed via the web.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers are using the command injection vulnerability to deface web pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited by crafting a specific HTTP GET request to the `pollit.cgi` script, including malicious parameters in the URL.

    *   **Command Injection:**  `http://www.example.com/<cgi-dir>/pollit.cgi?admin_password=foo&entered_password=foo&action=add_option&add_option=1&=poll_options=echo+0wned>/tmp/hacked|`
    *   **Admin Bypass:** `http://www.example.com/<cgi dir>/pollit.cgi?load=admin&entered_password=foo&admin_password=foo`
    *   **IP Disclosure:** `http://www.example.com/<dir of pollit cgi>/pollit_files/ips.txt`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server running the vulnerable Poll It script.
*   **Understanding of CGI Parameters:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to manipulate CGI parameters in the URL to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need prior authentication to exploit the command injection and admin bypass vulnerabilities.
*   **Knowledge of Script Path:** The attacker needs to know the location of the `pollit.cgi` script, and the `pollit_files` directory.
