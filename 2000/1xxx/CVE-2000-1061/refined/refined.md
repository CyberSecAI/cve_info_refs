Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2000-1061:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Microsoft Virtual Machine (VM) for Java has a flaw in how it handles ActiveX controls.  Normally, only digitally signed Java applets should be able to create and manipulate ActiveX controls. However, this vulnerability allows *unsigned* Java applets to do the same.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The VM fails to properly restrict access to ActiveX control creation and manipulation, allowing unsigned Java applets to bypass intended security restrictions.
*   **Unsafe ActiveX Control Execution:** The vulnerability enables execution of ActiveX controls, even those marked as "unsafe for scripting," which are normally restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute any ActiveX control present on the user's machine or hosted on the attacker's site, allowing them to perform any action the user could, potentially including:
    *   Creating, changing, or deleting data.
    *   Sending or receiving data from a website.
    *   Reformatting the hard drive.
    *   Gaining complete control over the machine (if the user has administrative privileges).
*   **Bypassing Security Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows malicious code to bypass standard security measures for ActiveX controls and Java applets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker can host a malicious Java applet on a website. If a user visits this page, the applet can exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary ActiveX controls.
*   **HTML Email:** An attacker can embed a malicious Java applet in an HTML-formatted email. If the email is previewed, the applet could be triggered, executing malicious ActiveX controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Website Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a website with a malicious Java applet.
*   **Email Sending:** The attacker could send an HTML email containing the malicious applet.
*   **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious website or previewing a malicious email.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attacker doesn't need any special privileges on the victim's machine. The vulnerability is exploited by the malicious code that is executed in the context of the victim's user account.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Placing a web site within the Restricted Sites zone in Internet Explorer will prevent this vulnerability.
*   Disabling Active Scripting or Scripting of Java applets will prevent exploitation.
*   The vulnerability resides within the Microsoft VM and not with any particular ActiveX control or ActiveX technology itself.
*   The vulnerability affects specific builds of the Microsoft VM, particularly those in the 3000 series numbered 3317 or earlier.
*   The patch restores security restrictions to prevent the vulnerability.
