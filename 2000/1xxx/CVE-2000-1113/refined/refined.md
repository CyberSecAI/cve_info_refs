The content is related to CVE-2000-1113.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is an unchecked buffer in the code that parses .ASX files within Windows Media Player. This allows for a buffer overflow by inserting malformed data into an .ASX file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow vulnerability.
- Lack of proper bounds checking when parsing .ASX files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows a malicious user to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer.
- The code runs with the same privileges as the user, potentially leading to data compromise, software misuse, downloading of additional software, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious .ASX file to a victim and enticing them to open or preview it.
- Hosting a malicious .ASX file on a website, which can be automatically launched when a user visits the site (though this can be mitigated by browser security settings).
- Sending an HTML email that, when opened, opens a browser window to the website hosting the malicious .ASX file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malformed .ASX file.
- They need to be able to deliver the file to the victim, either by direct transfer or by hosting it on a website.
- Some level of social engineering or trickery might be needed to make the victim open the file or visit the malicious website.
