| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:27:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the default error response for status code 400.  This could be used by an attacker to expose "httpOnly" cookies, when no custom ErrorDocument was specified.  This affects all versions of Apache from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21.  It will be fixed upstream in 2.2.22 (via r1235454 [1]).  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235454>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:33:29 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785070](show_bug.cgi?id=785070 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2012-0053 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0021 CVE-2011-3607 httpd: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:41 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0053](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0053)  protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 14:52:53 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)) changes the amount of information sent back to an HTTP client when httpd detects one of the following problems:  1) HTTP request header line is longer than configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds the line (actually, a prefix of it read before reaching the limit) to its default 400 error page.  2) HTTP request header line is continuation of the previous line and both lines combined together exceed configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds previous line to its default 400 error page.  Note: previous line here may refer to a concatenation of more than one line, if previous lines were continuations too.  3) HTTP request header line does not contain : , which is a separator between the header name and its value.  Case 1) is the one that can be used by malicious javascript to gain access to httpOnly cookies.  A script can set additional cookies to make Cookie: request header line length exceed LimitRequestFieldSize and read values of a httpOnly protected cookies from the httpd's error page.  This may allow a script injected via some XSS flaw to gain access to cookies it can not access directly.  Upstream fix ensures that error page only contains header name, or 80 character prefix of the header name, if the name exceeds that limit.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-01 08:20:33 UTC  ``` Write up of the issue for the original reporter:   <http://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php>  It confirms the analysis above ([comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c10)  Denis    2012-02-20 14:29:13 UTC  ``` Is httpd-2.2.3-53  impacted by the issue httpd-2.2.3-53 ?

John, it has been resolved now via RHSA-2012:0323.  Previously it was vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c15)  bmorriso    2012-02-27 16:34:48 UTC  ``` Hi,  Any information on that status of the EWS fixes for this CVE?   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c17)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-03-07 15:50:42 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c15)) > Hi, >  > Any information on that status of the EWS fixes for this CVE?  Hi Blair,   We are working towards addressing of this issue in various versions of JBoss Enterprise Web Server too. But unfortunately as of right now we are unable to provide exact release date, when the updates can be expected (as the final date is subject of change depending on couple of internal conditions).  Hope the above being sufficient and helpful. Apologize, but can't provide more exact information.  Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2012-03-09 15:28:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue affects httpd packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, which are now in the Extended Life Phase of their life cycle. Therefore this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c24)  Mark J. Cox    2012-04-05 08:45:37 UTC  ``` Note that this issue does affect Apache 2.0 despite the Mitre CVE description.  Verification: <https://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.0.x/STATUS?view=diff&r1=1237164&r2=1237165&pathrev=1237165>   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c27)  Coty Sutherland    2012-05-01 16:43:10 UTC  ``` Are we making any kind of progress on this for EWS 1.0.2 (tomcat 6.0.32)?   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c28)  Coty Sutherland    2012-05-01 16:47:20 UTC  ``` Sorry, this isn't a tomcat issue, I meant to inquire about EWS 1.0.2's Apache (2.2.17)...   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c30)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:51:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 31](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c31)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c32)  Tomas Hoger    2012-07-27 07:15:59 UTC  ``` Mitigation instructions:  As noted in the original reporter's advisory (see [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)), this issue can be mitigated by using a custom ErrorDocument setting, such as:    ErrorDocument 400 "Bad Request"    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#errordocument>  It should be noted that ErrorDocument setting using path or external URL does not mitigate this issue.   It should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-22 13:44:51 UTC  ``` Vincent Danen 2011-11-02 17:14:55 EDT  It was reported [1] that an integer overflow was found in Apache in the ap_pregsub() function called from mod-setenvif.  When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field.  This would cause ap_pregsub() to overflow the length value in buffer size calculations, leading to the subsequent allocation call of a too-small buffer.  Filling this buffer with user-supplied data will lead to a buffer overflow.  Depending on the input data, this can lead to excessive allocation of server memory (resulting in killed processes due to out-of-memory conditions), invalid memory access when copying large amounts of data (which can lead to a termination of the httpd process), or possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  To trigger this flaw, mod_setenvif must be enabled (the default) and the attacker needs to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server (which, in most cases, would require local access to the file system or some web interface that allows for writing arbitrary files to the local file system, such as for custom .htaccess files).  There is currently no upstream fix, however to work around the problem, disable mod_setenvif.  [1] <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-12 10:06:25 UTC  ``` This issue was originally tracked with [CVE-2011-4415](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4415) via [bug #750935](show_bug.cgi?id=750935 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2011-4415 httpd: SetEnvIf resource exhaustion").  Patch for this issue was added upstream to trunk (future 2.4.x httpd versions) via following commit:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1198940>  That fix is not applicable to older httpd versions, such as 2.2.x.  There still on-going upstream discussion on how to address this in older httpd versions:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46260>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c2)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-24 14:49:21 UTC  ``` There are still no follow up on this discussion.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-26 14:46:10 UTC  ``` Following fix is already committed in upstream SVN for 2.2.x:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1227280>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c4)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-27 09:02:09 UTC  ``` Theese are the only exploits/reproducers currently available/released for this: <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 21:58:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0323 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0323.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:48:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-20 19:13:37 UTC  ``` RMDG partner and independent security consultancy, "Context Information  Security" has made CPNI Response aware of a security vulnerability which  could potentially allow an attacker to gain full internal access to a  network from the internet.  The technique exploits insecurely configured reverse web proxies to gain  access to internal/DMZ systems.  This attack is based on an Apache web server which is using "mod_rewrite"  to proxy web requests internally. Other proxies may suffer from this  issue.  The vulnerability occurs if the Apache configuration file is configured  like this:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) <http://internalserver:80$1> [P]  As opposed to:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) [http://internalserver:80/$1](http://internalserver:80/%241) [P]   It is important for readers to review their reverse proxy configurations  to ensure that the rewrite rules are securely configured and cannot be  abused in such a way that they can be used to compromise internal systems.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-26 11:54:29 UTC  ``` Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p>   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:10:49 UTC  ``` This flaw is now public, and has been fixed in svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  The full upstream advisory is as follows (noted because it contains mitigation information):  Apache HTTP Server Security Advisory ====================================  Title:       mod_proxy reverse proxy exposure  CVE:         [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) Date:        20111005 Product:     Apache HTTP Server Versions:    httpd 1.3 all versions, httpd 2.x all versions  Description: ============  An exposure was reported affecting the use of Apache HTTP Server in reverse proxy mode.  We would like to thank Context Information Security Ltd for reporting this issue to us.  When using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a reverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently expose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted requests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern match was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an unintended target URL.  For future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will validate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The documentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.  Details: ======== A configuration like one of the following examples:    RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ProxyPassMatch (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2>  could result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:    GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1  would get translated to a target of:    <http://images.example.com@other.example.com/something.png>  This will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname "other.example.com", as the "images.example.com@" segment would be treated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a remote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those expected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.  The request-URI string in this example, "@other.example.com/something.png", is not valid according to the HTTP specification, since it neither an absolute URI ("<http://example.com/path>") nor an absolute path ("/path").  For future releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests, instead returning a "400 Bad Request" error.  Actions: ========  Apache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine if they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying. Affected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:     <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>  For example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:    RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  to ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading "/".   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:12:39 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 743653](show_bug.cgi?id=743653 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2011-3368 httpd: reverse web proxy vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-06 09:21:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)) > Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that > is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases: >  >   <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p> >   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]  The example was changed to:   RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  via:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179283>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 15:05:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/reverseproxybypass/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-11 13:40:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:56:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1392 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1392.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:57:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1391 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1391.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c20)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-15 20:31:34 UTC  ``` The upstream fix for this issue is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  However that fix is insufficient as it does not handle HTTP 0.9 style requests (as noted via <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722545#c15>).

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2012

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2012

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or proof of concept code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1455387.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70267263072071&id=1455387.1 ).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70335995559268&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2012 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1455387.1](//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?_afrLoop=70267263072071&id=1455387.1 ) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

### Appendix - Oracle Database Server

#### Oracle Database Server Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security fixes for the Oracle Database Server divided as follows:

* 4 new security fixes for the Oracle Database Server.  3 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  None of these fixes are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have the Oracle Database Server installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle-Database-Server).
* 1 new security fix for Oracle Application Express Listener.  This vulnerability is remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle Application Express Listener).
* 2 new security fixes for Oracle Secure Backup.  Both of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2012verbose.html#Oracle Secure Backup).

Please note that on April 30, 2012, Oracle released [Security Alert CVE-2012-1675](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2012-1675.html). This Security Alert provides mitigation instructions against the publicly disclosed "TNS Listener Poison Attack." Because of the nature of this issue (amount of code change required, potential for significant regression issues, and inability to automate the application of a fix), Oracle does not plan to backport a permanent fix for this vulnerability in any upcoming Critical Patch Update. Customers are therefore strongly advised to implement the recommendations set forth in the [Security Alert](/security-alerts/alert-cve-2012-1675.html).

# Nmap Network Scanning

[![Cover of Nmap Network Scanning](https://nmap.org/book/cover/nns-whole-cover-326x200.jpg)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20)

*Nmap Network Scanning* is
the official guide to the [Nmap Security Scanner](https://nmap.org/),
a free and open source utility used by millions of people for
network discovery, administration, and security auditing. From
explaining port scanning basics for novices to detailing
low-level packet crafting methods used by advanced hackers, this book suits
all levels of security and networking professionals. A 42-page reference
guide documents every Nmap feature and option, while the rest of the
book demonstrates how to apply those features to quickly solve
real-world tasks. Examples and diagrams show actual communication on
the wire.

Topics include subverting firewalls and intrusion detection systems,
optimizing Nmap performance, and automating common networking tasks
with the Nmap Scripting Engine. Hints and instructions are provided
for common uses such as taking network inventory, penetration testing,
detecting rogue wireless access points, and quashing network worm
outbreaks. Nmap runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Nmap's original author, Gordon “Fyodor” Lyon, wrote
this book to share everything he has learned about network scanning
during more than a decade of Nmap development. It was briefly the #1
selling computer book on Amazon
([screenshot](https://nmap.org/book/img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).
The book is in English, though [several translations](#translations) are in the works.

Key facts: The ISBN is 978-0-9799587-1-7 (ISBN-10 is 0-9799587-1-7)
and suggested retail prices are $49.95 in the U.S., £34.95 in
the U.K., and €39.95 in Europe. Like most books, it costs less
online (as little as $32.97 - see [purchasing
options](#purchase)). It is 468 pages long. The official release date was
January 1, 2009, though Amazon managed to beat that by a couple weeks.

About half of the content is [available in the
free online edition](toc.html). Chapters exclusive to the print edition
include “Detecting and Subverting Firewalls and Intrusion
Detection Systems”, “Optimizing Nmap Performance”,
“Port Scanning Techniques and Algorithms”, “Host
Discovery (Ping Scanning)”, and more.
The *solution* selections which provide detailed
instructions on the best way to solve common networking tasks are also
exclusive to the printed book. The
[final table of contents](toc.pdf) and [cover art](cover/) are available.

  the book](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) for $32.97, which includes domestic shipping. It is

    on the right hand side for a list of nearby stores which carry it.
    You can
    also [order
    it online](http://search.barnesandnoble.com/nmap-network-scanning//e/9780979958717/) from that page, though it

## Updates

Several people asked whether Nmap Network Scanning
is still up to date, particularly after the release of [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/). The good news is that virtually all of the
content remains accurate. But we have added some new features and
NSE scripts which aren't yet documented in NNS.

For a comprehensive and completely current view of Nmap, I
recommend reading Nmap Network Scanning first, then read all the
changelog entries we've produced since the book was finished. The
book is completely up-to-date with Nmap 4.76. So after (or before)
you're done reading Nmap Network Scanning, visit
the [Nmap changelog](https://nmap.org/changelog.html) and search
in the file for “Nmap 4.76”. Read each item upward from there
(scrolling backward) until you get to the top.
## Translations

We would love to make the Nmap book more accessible by working with foreign publishers who will translate and distribute it in their markets. If you are such a publisher or know a good one to suggest, please let me know. Here are the current or in-progress translations:

* [![Cover of 'Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern'](xlate/nmap-opensourcepress-de-cover-95x125.jpg)](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270)
  [Nmap - Netzwerke scannen, analysieren und absichern](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270) is the German translation by Open Source Press, released in June 2009 at a list price of €39.90. Translation was performed expertly by Dinu Gherman. They have contributed back their [Nmap Reference Guide German translation](/man/de/).* [![Cover of 'Exame de Redes com NMAP'](xlate/nmap-ciencia-moderna-cover-95x125.jpg)](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778)
    [Exame de Redes com NMAP](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) is the Brazilian Portuguese translation by Editora Ciência Moderna. Translation was done by [Angico](http://www.angico.org) and release was August 26, 2009. You can [buy it directly from the publisher](http://www.lcm.com.br/index.php?Escolha=20&Livro=L00778) for R$95.20.* [![Cover of '엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝'](xlate/nmap-acornpub-ko-cover-95x125.png)](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap)
      The official Korean translation, entitled [엔맵 네트워크 스캐닝](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/book/nmap), has been created by [Acorn Publishing Co](http://www.acornpub.co.kr/). The release date was November 16, 2009 at a list price of KRW 35,000.

## Current status

**August 26:** Many Barnes & Noble stores now stock NNS, as described in the [purchasing section](#purchase).

**August 26:** Editora Ciência Moderna released the Brazilian Portuguese translation. See [translations](#translations).

**July 31:** Held a [book signing](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2009/q3/0426.html) at Defcon. All copies sold out in 3 hours.

**July 17:** Added [Updates](#updates) section.

**July 16:** [Nmap 5.00](https://nmap.org/5/) released!

**June 11:** The German translation from Open Source Press is [now available](https://www.opensourcepress.de/index.php?26&backPID=178&tt_products=270). They also contributed back a [German translation of the Nmap Reference Guide.](/man/de/)

**January 30:** Today the Amazon price is back to $32.97 after several days at $37.96. I hope they keep it at this price!

**January 23:** Amazon has raised their prices, so I've added [more purchase options](#purchase), though the cheapest is still only about $4.50 less than Amazon when domestic shipping is taken into account.

**January 21:** NNS receives a [glowing review](http://netsecurity.about.com/od/14/gr/NMapBook.htm) from About.Com.

**January 19:** Translation contracts have been signed for Korean and Brazilian Portuguese editions of Nmap Network Scanning! See the new [Translations](#translations) section for details.

**January 5:** [Acorn Publishing Co.](http://www.acornpub.co.kr) will be publishing the official Korean translation of Nmap Network Scanning! Release is expected in August.

**January 4:** NNS is finally in stock at [Amazon U.K.](http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0979958717) and [Amazon Germany](http://www.amazon.de/dp/0979958717). Amazon Canada currently still has a [1-3 week backlog](http://www.amazon.ca/dp/0979958717).

**December 31, 2008:** NNS makes Richard Bejtlich's TaoSecurity [Top Books of 2008](http://taosecurity.blogspot.com/2008/12/best-book-bejtlich-read-in-2008.html) list.

**December 29, 2008:** A new [Information Week review](http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2008/12/nmap_network_sc.html) is one of the best so far!

**December 19, 2008:** The book is [back in stock on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) after a 10 day dry spell!

**December 10, 2008:** Amazon has now indexed this book as part of
their “Search Inside” program. While Amazon intends this
as a marketing tool for prospective buyers, it can be even more useful
for folks who already own the book. While we're proud of our index,
Search Inside can help find more obscure terms or combinations of them. You can try this out by visiting
the [Amazon
NNS page](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20), scrolling down to the Search Inside box, and typing in a
term such as Trinity or Microsoft.

**December 9, 2008:** Sales were so high that Amazon ran out of stock in the US, UK, and Germany. They say it may take a week or more to ship. Amazon still offers a great price, but for those who can't wait, I've added a [purchasing options](#purchase) section. It includes vendor such as A1Books and Barnes & Noble with NNS in stock now.

**December 9, 2008:** Nmap Network Scanning sales surge further to become #1 on [Amazon's computer book best seller list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20)! Since we can't keep that rank forever, I took a [screenshot](img/nns-top-seller-471x512.png) ([larger version](img/nns-top-seller-942x1024.png)).

**December 8, 2008:**
An [excellent
Slashdot review](http://books.slashdot.org/books/08/12/08/1443223.shtml) causes NNS to rocket into [Amazon's top 10 computer books](http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books/5/ref%3Dpd_zg_hrsr_b_1_2%26tag%3Dsecbks-20).

**December 6, 2008:** Amazon has [fixed the price](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20) so it is now $33.71 rather than $49.95. NNS is **in stock and shipping**!

**December 2, 2008:** The book has [an initial page on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0979958717?tag=secbks-20). You can pre-order it now, but Amazon is showing a pre-order price of $49.95. I expect the price to be about $33 when Amazon starts shipping it within a week or two. Amazon will probably refund the difference per their "Pre-order price guarantee", but it might be safer to wait. Book seller BOOKSPLUSMORESTUFF claims to have the book "in stock" on Amazon for $53.94 including shipping. That may or may not be true.

**November 14, 2008:** The book is finished and submitted to the
printer! The official release date is January 1, 2009, though our
goal is to make it available on Amazon and other retailers by
mid-December. To be notified upon publication, join the
low-traffic [nmap-hackers
announcement mailing list](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce).

**September 15, 2008:** The Black Hat/Defcon pre-release was a huge
success! All of the Defcon copies were snapped up as soon as the
vendor room opened, and the Black Hat copies also sold out in the
first morning of the conference. Thanks to Bill Pollock of No Starch
Press and Dave Hemsath of BreakPoint Books for handling sales. My
conference presentation video and audio have
been [posted
online](http://insecure.org/presentations/) just in time for
the [Nmap
4.75 release](http://seclists.org/nmap-hackers/2008/0004.html) which includes the new features discussed in that
presentation.

**July 25, 2008**: Defcon Pre-Release announced! We have decided to
launch the book with a limited pre-release version at Defcon 16.

**July 1, 2008**: After years of work, Nmap Network Scanning is nearing completion. You can browse the [current table of contents](toc.pdf) to see what is coming. We recently conducted a test-printing of some prepublication copies:

[![Prepublication test-print of Nmap Network Scanning](images/nns-preprint3-750w.jpg)](images/nns-preprint3-1224x1466.jpg)

Apache HTTP Server Security Advisory
====================================

Title:       mod_proxy reverse proxy exposure

CVE:         CVE-2011-3368
Date:        20111005
Product:     Apache HTTP Server
Versions:    httpd 1.3 all versions, httpd 2.x all versions

Description:
============

An exposure was reported affecting the use of Apache HTTP Server in
reverse proxy mode.  We would like to thank Context Information
Security Ltd for reporting this issue to us.

When using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a
reverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently
expose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted
requests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern
match was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an
unintended target URL.

For future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will
validate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The
documentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with
pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.

Details:
========

A configuration like one of the following examples:

  RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]
  ProxyPassMatch (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2>

could result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:

  GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1

would get translated to a target of:

  <http://images.example.com> () other example com/something.png

This will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname
"other.example.com", as the "images.example.com@" segment would be
treated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a
remote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those
expected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.

The request-URI string in this example,
"@other.example.com/something.png", is not valid according to the HTTP
specification, since it neither an absolute URI
("[http://example.com/path"](http://example.com/path%22);) nor an absolute path ("/path").  For
future releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests,
instead returning a "400 Bad Request" error.

Actions:
========

Apache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine
if they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying.
Affected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:

   <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>

For example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:

  RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]

to ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading "/".

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2015

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released fixes. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore *strongly* recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update fixes *without* delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 169 new security fixes across the product families listed below. Please note that a blog entry summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at <https://blogs.oracle.com/security>.

Please note that on October 16, 2014, Oracle released information for  [CVE-2014-3566 "POODLE"](/security-alerts/poodlecve-2014-3566.html) .Customers of affected Oracle products are strongly advised to apply the fixes and/or configuration steps that were announced for CVE-2014-3566 in addition to the fixes announced in this CPU.

This Critical Patch Update advisory is also available in an XML format that conforms to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Format (CVRF) version 1.1. More information about Oracle's use of CVRF is available at:  [https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF](/security-alerts/cpufaq.html#CVRF).

### Affected Products and Components

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. The product area of the patches for the listed versions is shown in the Patch Availability column corresponding to the specified Products and Versions column. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column below or in the  [Patch Availability Table](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015.html#PIN) to access the documentation for those patches.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](//cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same**CVE#** in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see  [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the only variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review  [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and how to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update January 2015 Availability Document,  [My Oracle Support Note 1942215.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1942215.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in  [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1) .Please review the  [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available to customers who have Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/) . Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download patches released through the Critical Patch Update program for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 19 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE. 14 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found  [here](https:///security-alerts/cpujan2015verbose.html#JAVA).

The CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). When the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", lowering the CVSS Base Score. For example, a Base Score of 10.0 becomes 7.5.

Users should only use the default Java Plug-in and Java Web Start from the latest JDK or JRE 7 and 8 releases.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https:///https%3A//support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-05-07
Updated:
2012-05-07
# RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache HTTP Server component for JBoss Enterprise Web
Server 1.0.2 that fixes multiple security issues and one bug is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1330 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server must be restarted for this update to take effect.

# Context IS Advisory - Apache Reverse Proxy Bypass Vulnerability

---

*From*: Context IS - Disclosure <disclosure () contextis co uk>

*Date*: Wed, 5 Oct 2011 18:15:58 +0100

---

```
===============================ADVISORY==============================
Systems Affected:    Apache httpd
Severity:            High
Category:            Proxy Bypass
Author:              Context Information Security Ltd
Reported to vendor:  16th November 2011
Advisory Issued:     5th October 2011
Reference:           CVE-2011-3368
===============================ADVISORY==============================

Description
-----------
Context discovered a security vulnerability which allows for Apache in reverse proxy mode to be used to access
internal/DMZ systems due to a weakness in its handling of URLs being processed by mod_rewrite.

Analysis
--------
If the Apache configuration file is configured as follows (as previously recommended by Apache):

RewriteRule ^(.*) <http://internalserver$1> [P]

And not with a trailing slash:

RewriteRule ^(.*) [http://internalserver/$1](http://internalserver/%241) [P]

Then a request can be made to the proxy server to alter the URL using the user authentication URI syntax, such as:

GET @InternalNotAccessibleServer/console HTTP/1.0

Causing the proxy to rewrite the URL to:

<http://internalserver@InternalNotAccessibleServer/console>

And provide access to the internal server which is not externally accessible.

For an in-depth analysis of this security issue read Context’s blog at:
<http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/reverseproxybypass/>

Technologies Affected
---------------------

Apache httpd 1.3 all versions
Apache httpd 2.x all versions

Vendor Response
---------------
Apache have released a patch for this issue but recommend configuration files are reviewed.
Patch available from:
<http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>

Disclosure Timeline
-------------------
16th November 2011 – Vendor Notification
5th October 2011 – Patch Released by Apache

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-20 19:13:37 UTC  ``` RMDG partner and independent security consultancy, "Context Information  Security" has made CPNI Response aware of a security vulnerability which  could potentially allow an attacker to gain full internal access to a  network from the internet.  The technique exploits insecurely configured reverse web proxies to gain  access to internal/DMZ systems.  This attack is based on an Apache web server which is using "mod_rewrite"  to proxy web requests internally. Other proxies may suffer from this  issue.  The vulnerability occurs if the Apache configuration file is configured  like this:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) <http://internalserver:80$1> [P]  As opposed to:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) [http://internalserver:80/$1](http://internalserver:80/%241) [P]   It is important for readers to review their reverse proxy configurations  to ensure that the rewrite rules are securely configured and cannot be  abused in such a way that they can be used to compromise internal systems.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-26 11:54:29 UTC  ``` Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p>   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:10:49 UTC  ``` This flaw is now public, and has been fixed in svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  The full upstream advisory is as follows (noted because it contains mitigation information):  Apache HTTP Server Security Advisory ====================================  Title:       mod_proxy reverse proxy exposure  CVE:         [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) Date:        20111005 Product:     Apache HTTP Server Versions:    httpd 1.3 all versions, httpd 2.x all versions  Description: ============  An exposure was reported affecting the use of Apache HTTP Server in reverse proxy mode.  We would like to thank Context Information Security Ltd for reporting this issue to us.  When using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a reverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently expose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted requests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern match was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an unintended target URL.  For future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will validate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The documentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.  Details: ======== A configuration like one of the following examples:    RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ProxyPassMatch (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2>  could result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:    GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1  would get translated to a target of:    <http://images.example.com@other.example.com/something.png>  This will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname "other.example.com", as the "images.example.com@" segment would be treated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a remote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those expected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.  The request-URI string in this example, "@other.example.com/something.png", is not valid according to the HTTP specification, since it neither an absolute URI ("<http://example.com/path>") nor an absolute path ("/path").  For future releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests, instead returning a "400 Bad Request" error.  Actions: ========  Apache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine if they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying. Affected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:     <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>  For example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:    RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  to ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading "/".   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:12:39 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 743653](show_bug.cgi?id=743653 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2011-3368 httpd: reverse web proxy vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-06 09:21:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)) > Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that > is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases: >  >   <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p> >   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]  The example was changed to:   RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  via:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179283>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 15:05:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/reverseproxybypass/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-11 13:40:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:56:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1392 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1392.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:57:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1391 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1391.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c20)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-15 20:31:34 UTC  ``` The upstream fix for this issue is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  However that fix is insufficient as it does not handle HTTP 0.9 style requests (as noted via <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722545#c15>).  The additional fix to handle HTTP 0.9 requests is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1188745>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c21)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-15 20:32:47 UTC  ``` Sorry, I didn't realize we had already filed a bug for the incomplete fix ([bug #752080](show_bug.cgi?id=752080 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3639 httpd: http 0.9 request bypass of the reverse proxy vulnerability CVE-2011-3368 fix")).   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:48:37 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:02:58 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2405-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3607 CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317
                 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0053

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2011-3607:

  An integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
  files.

CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317:

  The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
  arbitrary server. The could allow the attacker to access internal
  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.

  The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
  issue.

  Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
  configuration

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  <http://internal-host$1>

  is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
  configurations:

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  <http://internal-host$1>
    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  [http://internal-host/$1](http://internal-host/%241)

CVE-2012-0031:

  An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
  the impact of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-0053:

  The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
  expose "httpOnly" cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0542)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1329 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
After installing the updated packages, users must restart the httpd
service for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

openSUSE Security Update: update for apache2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2013:0248-1
Rating: moderate
References:
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be installed.
Description:
- ignore case when checking against SNI server names.
[bnc#798733] httpd-2.2.x-bnc798733-SNI\_ignorecase.diff
- better cleanup of busy count after recovering from
failure [bnc#789828]
httpd-2.2.x-bnc789828-mod\_balancer.diff
-
httpd-2.2.x-bnc788121-CVE-2012-4557-mod\_proxy\_ajp\_timeout.di
ff: backend timeouts should not affect the entire worker.
[bnc#788121]
- httpd-2.2.x-envvars.diff obsoletes
httpd-2.0.54-envvars.dif: Fix for low profile bug
CVE-2012-0883 about improper LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH handling.
[bnc#757710]
-
httpd-2.2.x-bnc777260-CVE-2012-2687-mod\_negotiation\_filename
\_xss.diff Escape filename for the case that uploads are
allowed with untrusted user's control over filenames and
mod\_negotiation enabled on the same directory.
CVE-2012-2687 [bnc#777260]
- httpd-2.2.x-CVE-2011-3368\_CVE-2011-4317-bnc722545.diff
reworked to reflect the upstream changes. This will
prevent the "Invalid URI in request OPTIONS \*" messages
in the error log. [bnc#722545]
- /etc/init.d/apache2: new argument "check-reload". Exits 1
if httpd2 runs on deleted binaries such as after package
update, else 0. This is used by equally modified
/etc/logrotate.d/apache2, which uses "/etc/init.d/apache2
check-reload" in its prerotate script. These changes
prevent httpd2 from being (gracefully) reloaded by
logrotate, executed by cron, if new binaries have been
installed. Instead, a warning is printed on stdout and is
being logged to the syslogs. If this happens, apache's
logs are NOT rotated, and the running processes are left
untouched. This limits the maximum damage of log rotation
to unrotated logs. "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart" (or
"rcapache2 restart") must be executed manually in such a
case. [bnc#728876]
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use YaST online\_update.
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
- openSUSE 11.4:
zypper in -t patch 2013-17
