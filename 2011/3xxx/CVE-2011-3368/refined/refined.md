  "CVE-2011-3368": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way the Apache HTTP Server handled proxied requests using mod_rewrite or ProxyPassMatch. A remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an arbitrary server, potentially disclosing sensitive information from internal web servers not directly accessible.",
    "root_cause": "The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI when using mod_rewrite or ProxyPassMatch in reverse proxy configurations, allowing a crafted URI to bypass intended proxy restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
       "Insecure reverse proxy configuration"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could bypass reverse proxy restrictions, potentially gaining access to internal web servers and sensitive data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP request containing a malformed URI."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by configurations using the `RewriteRule` or `ProxyPassMatch` directives with a pattern match, where the server doesn't validate the request URI. This allows a pattern to expand to unintended target URLs. The documentation for httpd was updated to reflect the more general risks with pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration."
