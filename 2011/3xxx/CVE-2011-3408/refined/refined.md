Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-3408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) improperly validating permissions when a lower-integrity process sends a device event message to a higher-integrity process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** CSRSS does not properly check the permissions associated with inter-process device event messages. This allows a lower-integrity process to potentially influence or control a higher-integrity process, which is a privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of another process.
- **System Compromise:** If the target process runs with administrator privileges, the attacker could:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to the affected system.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application designed to send a malicious device event message to a higher-integrity process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid local logon credentials.
- Ability to execute code on the target system.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is located in the `csrsrv.dll` component.
- Microsoft's Exploitability Index for this vulnerability was rated as "Important," suggesting that exploitation was likely.
- The security update addresses the issue by modifying how CSRSS evaluates inter-process device event message permissions.
- The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security patch, and there were no reports of active exploitation at the time of the patch's release.
- The vulnerability affects Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
