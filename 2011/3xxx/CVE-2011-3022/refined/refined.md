Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3022:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the inappropriate use of HTTP instead of HTTPS when fetching a translation script.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is the usage of an insecure protocol (HTTP) for retrieving translation scripts. This exposes the communication channel to potential eavesdropping or manipulation by a man-in-the-middle attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the translation script. This could potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where the injected script executes in the context of the victim's browser, enabling a wide range of malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. An attacker positioned between the user and the server providing the translation script could intercept the HTTP request and respond with a modified script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server hosting the translation script. This could be achieved through various means like compromising a network device, using a rogue Wi-Fi access point, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the user's network infrastructure.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is categorized as "Medium" severity.
- The vulnerability was identified by Google Chrome Security Team (Jorge Obes).
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Chrome stable version 17.0.963.56.
