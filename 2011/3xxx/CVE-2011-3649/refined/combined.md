## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Steps to Reproduce:
1. have a canvasA which is inserted into DOM tree and visible
2. draw green rect onto canvasA
3. have canvasB, which is not inserted into DOM tree
4. draw canvasA onto canvasB
5. draw red rect and different-origin image onto canvasA
A repro implementation is attached.
Actual Results:
Red rect and different-origin image on canvasB (which has origin-clean flag true) if accessed 'later than immediately'
Expected Results:
Green rect and no different-origin image on canvasB (which has origin-clean flag true)
- GPU: GeForce 9650M GT, Driver Version 270.61
- also reproducable in FF4.0
- bug does not occurs when canvasA meets any of the following conditions:
. is not in DOM tree
. has css display: none
. has css visible: hidden
. has css opacity less than 1 and the canvasA is not (fully?)
overlayed by another element

'later than immediately' as mentioned in the repro steps can mean up to several seconds later. It appears, that the higher the system load, the longer has to be waited. In the repro attachement, I used a timeout of 1000ms, which in some cases might be to short.

I can't reproduce this (but I'm not on Windows). I end up with a picture of monkeys (canvasA) and a green rectangle (img made from canvasB) which is what I'd expect and what I see in other browsers. When you create canvasB with canvasA as a source that's a snapshot, it should not be affected by future changes to canvasA; since it should never be "dirty" you're allowed to get a dataURL out of it.
If this can be reproduced on Windows I wonder if hardware acceleration has anything to do with it. Or is there some "layers" optimization where the two canvases share a copy-on-write surface and we forget to unhook them when one of them changes?

On Windows, it only shows up when you're using D2D. I think this is a bug in our D2D backend, presumably some kind of issue with synchronization and snapshotting like dveditz said. Should be fairly easy to analyze.Assignee: nobody → bas.schouten

So, the reason for this bug is as follows:
Canvas A receives a drawing command, it executed it.
Canvas A is drawn to Canvas B, Canvas B flushed canvas A and puts a command in the D2D pipeline to draw Canvas A to it.
Canvas A received another drawing command.
Canvas A gets flushed.
Canvas B gets flushed.
When Canvas B gets flushed and the draw of Canvas A to Canvas B actually gets executed, Canvas A's contents will have changed.
There's a couple of things that can be done:
Option A. Flush Canvas B after having executed the Fill call inside the D2D backend from Canvas A. This is super-easy but not great performance wise.
Option B. Create a copy of Canvas A in the D2D backend and draw that to Canvas B. This is also easy, but again not great performance wise.
Option C. Create two lists on each cairo surface, one with surfaces currently having a draw call queued depending on it, and not having flushed. And one list of surfaces it currently has a draw call enqueued for that haven't been flushed yet.
If Canvas A depends on Canvas B for a draw call and Canvas B gets a new drawing call it will flush any surfaces that depend on it (that will include Canvas A). If Canvas A gets flushed first it will tell Canvas B that it no longer needs to flush Canvas A if it gets a drawing call.
Option C is the best for performance, but the hardest to implement.

Bas, I'm having a bit of trouble understanding your example. Can you lay it out a little more concretely using the D2D api?

Imagine I have rt1 and rt2 (render target one and two), backed by bm1 and bm2 (bm1 and bm2). Now think of the following scenario:
rt1->FillRect()
rt1->Flush()
rt2->DrawBitmap(bm1);
rt1->FillRect();
rt1->Flush();
rt2->Flush();
When the DrawBitmap is placed in the command queue, bm1 looks the way we want it. When it is -executed- however (on rt2->Flush()), bm1 has been updated with the second FillRect, so different contents will be drawn than when the DrawBitmap was enqueued.

I'm surprised D2D doesn't take care of this for us, I can't see a use case for the semantics it gives.
Anyways, I think something like option C is going to be the best thing here. I don't yet understand why we need two lists, but the premise of flushing when things change and someone depends on the old version is good.

It seems like we should be able to solve this by having a single list on surfaces that lists their users. (surf1->drawImage(surf2) will add surf1 as a user to surf2). Before surf2 is dirtied it flushes all of it's users and removes them from the list of users.
Is there a scenario this doesn't handle?

Yes, the downside is if surf2 is dirtied, it doesn't need to flush users that have already flushed. (i.e. if surf1 is flushed, we want it to remove itself from surf2).

If an attacker were to use delayed getImageData on canvasB they would presumably get the pixels the user sees, i.e. the different-origin image.

I considered pushing this to aurora, but it doesn't apply cleanly:
patching file gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo-d2d-private.h
Hunk #1 FAILED at 43
Hunk #2 FAILED at 75
Hunk #3 FAILED at 133
3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo-d2d-private.h.rej
patching file gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo-d2d-surface.cpp
Hunk #3 FAILED at 2344
1 out of 6 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file gfx/cairo/cairo/src/cairo-d2d-surface.cpp.rej
The merge doesn't look difficult, but I think it'd better be done by someone who knows this code, in case there are interactions/dependencies on other changes that have been happening in there.

Likely due to the cairo merge. I'm checking out aurora (takes a while) and will have a look.

Why is the bug still open? Looks like we've got a trunk checkin in the Firefox 7 timeframe ([comment 31](/show_bug.cgi?id=655836#c31 "VERIFIED FIXED - Information leakage between canvases and origins [Windows D2D]")) and an aurora checkin during the Firefox 6 cycle ([comment 37](/show_bug.cgi?id=655836#c37 "VERIFIED FIXED - Information leakage between canvases and origins [Windows D2D]")) and I don't see any sign of a reopen -- assuming it just got missed.Status: ASSIGNED → RESOLVEDClosed: 13 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

This is the fix for the reintroduction in Azure. I'll add a reftest to the bug later today, as this issue reoccuring has proven how important it was for this bug to get a reftest!

Well, I figured otherwise the AtIndex function might go bad? Just safety really, do you think it doesn't matter?

Actually never mind, it's OK because you don't set srcSurf if that check fails. Carry on!

The symptoms of the bug remained identical, the reduced testcase is still valid.
