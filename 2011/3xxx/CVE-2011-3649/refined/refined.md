Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3649:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2011-3649.  Specifically, the Mozilla Security Advisory 2011-50 and Bugzilla bug 655836, explicitly mention CVE-2011-3649. Bug 655836 is marked as blocking this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an information leakage issue within the canvas element when using the "Azure" graphics backend on Windows, which leverages Direct2D (D2D).  Specifically, when drawing one canvas onto another, changes to the source canvas were not being correctly reflected or isolated. This allowed a canvas from one origin to potentially read pixel data from a canvas belonging to another origin. The vulnerability was introduced because the `Snapshot()` API wasn't being used when drawing one Azure surface to another.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Origin Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is that a malicious website could use the canvas element to read data (pixels) from canvases belonging to a different origin, thus bypassing the same-origin policy.
*   **Improper Surface Handling:** The D2D backend was not correctly handling dependencies between surfaces (canvases) that were drawn onto each other. Changes to a source surface were not properly flushed or reflected on surfaces that had already drawn from it, leading to the information leakage.
*   **Reintroduction of Issue:** The issue was originally fixed, but reintroduced when changes were made to not use the Snapshot API.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Theft:**  A malicious web page could steal sensitive information, like images or other graphical data from a different website.  This could lead to potential information disclosure or compromise of user privacy.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker would need to create a web page containing malicious JavaScript code that uses the canvas API to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Cross-Origin Drawing:** The malicious code would draw from a source canvas from a different origin, leveraging the flaw in how D2D was handling surface updates.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Content:** An attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious web page or inject code into a website.
*   **Target User using D2D on Windows:** The target user needs to be using a vulnerable version of Firefox or SeaMonkey or Thunderbird on Windows with D2D enabled.

**Additional Details from the Content (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   **Specific Graphics Backend:** The vulnerability is specific to the "Azure" graphics backend on Windows, which uses Direct2D. This makes it platform-specific.
*   **Timing Issue:** The bug manifested itself when changes on canvas A were not immediately reflected on canvas B.
*   **Mitigation Complexity:** Initial attempts to solve the issue considered approaches ranging from simple flushes, to more complex dependency tracking, ultimately requiring a fix to use the Snapshot API.
*   **Reintroduction:** The vulnerability was initially fixed, but reintroduced in a later version. This highlights the complexities of maintaining security in a large project.
*   **Test Case:** A specific test case was developed to reproduce and verify the fix.
*   **Fix involved:** Use of the `Snapshot()` API when drawing one Azure surface to another.
*   **Multiple Fixes and Versions:** The content shows that there were multiple attempts to fix the issue and that it needed to be addressed in multiple release channels of Firefox.
*   **Bug Bounty:** The reporter was given a bug bounty.

In summary, CVE-2011-3649 was a critical security vulnerability stemming from how canvas drawing operations were handled in Firefox, SeaMonkey and Thunderbird when using the D2D backend on Windows. The vulnerability allowed cross-origin data leakage due to inconsistent updates of canvas contents in the graphics pipeline. The fix involved ensuring proper isolation and snapshotting of canvas contents when being used as a source for drawing to another canvas.
