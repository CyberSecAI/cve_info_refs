Based on the provided information, here's an analysis:

**CVE-2011-3726:** This CVE is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content. However, the content discusses path disclosure vulnerabilities in Joomla!, specifically mentioning Joomla! 1.6.1, and other PHP CMS applications. While a specific CVE ID is not given in relation to the mentioned path disclosure issue,  it does mention that Joomla prior to 1.5.23 contains a flaw that may lead to an unauthorized information disclosure, and it was assigned CVE-2011-2488.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a path disclosure issue. The content doesn't provide specific technical details of the root cause. However, path disclosure vulnerabilities generally arise from errors in how an application handles file paths, leading to the exposure of internal file structure and potentially sensitive information.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Path disclosure, meaning the web server reveals the full path of the files, which can be used to help attackers discover configuration or other critical system files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The disclosure of file paths can provide an attacker with valuable information about the server's internal structure, potentially enabling further attacks and unauthorized access, if combined with other flaws.
*  **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by sending crafted requests to the web server that cause it to reveal the full path of files, which can be done by triggering error messages or by sending requests designed to expose server details.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance. They would also need to have some knowledge that could allow them to send requests that could reveal server file paths, such as triggering an error.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions that path disclosure issues are common in many PHP CMS applications, and provides a link to a list of vulnerable paths in various applications.
*   The email thread indicates the issue was reported in 2010 but was assigned a 2011 CVE ID because the public disclosure was in 2011.
*   The provided content does not offer specific details on how to exploit the vulnerability in Joomla 1.6.1.

**In summary:** The provided content relates to path disclosure vulnerabilities in Joomla and other PHP CMS applications, which is a common issue that is related to, but not the primary subject of CVE-2011-3726.
