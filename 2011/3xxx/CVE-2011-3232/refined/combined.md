How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# About the security content of Apple TV Software Update 4.4

This document describes the security content of Apple TV Software Update 4.4.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see " [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

#### Apple TV Software Update 4.4

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other authorities, are not trusted.

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve

  Description: Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses. Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509 certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root certificate.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3427

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection

  Description: Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some information about the previous data. If the same connection was attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3389

* **Apple TV**

  Impact: Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve

  Description: Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses. Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509 certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root certificate.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3427

* **Data Security**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection

  Description: Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some information about the previous data. If the same connection was attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3389

* **Home screen**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: Switching between applications may lead to the disclosure of sensitive application information

  Description: When switching between applications with the four-finger app switching gesture, the display could have revealed the previous application state. This issue is addressed by ensuring that the system properly calls the applicationWillResignActive: method when transitioning between applications.

Not holding 5 for this, but we should see what we can do for 6. The fix on the table is a large change that may or may not make it for 6, but in the event that it doesn't we should look into fixing the security problem here with a smaller safer patch for 6.

Assigning to dmandelin because he's got [bug 625600](/show_bug.cgi?id=625600 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update Yarr import").
That bug is basically "upgrade YARR". Does that mean you know that this bug is already fixed in the upstream YARR (therefore it's a sort of dupe/previously reported bug)? Are you simply hoping that it is? Or were simply going to wait until after that big change to figure out how to merge a fix in?
I'm concerned that the bug this depends on is blocked on a legal bug due to potential license incompatibility. This security bug exists in our current codebase and should absolutely not be blocked on a legal opinion about incorporating some other code.Assignee: general → dmandelin

For now, hoping. I figured that refreshing is required before we would really try to fix additional bugs in Yarr, so I might as well get that done, then see if those other bugs are taken care of them and then deal with if not.

The legal opinion doesn't block current progress. I worked around those libraries, by not using reference counting. The legal bug may tell us that we can use some actual replacements for the refcounting classes, which would keep us closer to Apple's code, which makes merges easier. But we are good to go with the current patch.

Attached patch

[Patch](attachment.cgi?id=535503&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=535503&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=653672&attachment=535503)

This stops the crash. The proximate bug is that Yarr computes a length delta for two adjacent disjuncts as
[int] delta = [unsigned] minSize1 - [unsigned] minSize2
They need to check if at the end of the string only if delta > 0. But the computation above can return a positive number that overflows to negative when converted to an int. The wider type makes this not happen.

Patch
r+ (for non-SPARC systems) on this one test, but I'm not sure we want to commit this without a full audit.
One thing of note is that int64 won't be wider than int on ILP64 systems (like SPARC), but there are also a number of other cases where YARR-JIT subtracts unchecked-value unsigned offsets from each other and sticks them into an int. Most of the places where you see the pattern |int result = thing - other;| in this file is a potential candidate for overflow. Maybe instead of committing this we should perform a full audit? Things like setupAlternative/DisjunctionOffsets and backtrack have similar errors. IMO we should try to go through and construct a test case to demonstrate each one to prevent further regressions.

CC'ing Chris Evans so he can check and make sure Chrome's version of YARR gets fixed or is unaffected.

Chrome uses irregexp, AFAIK... Aki, this doesn't affect Chrome does it?

Chris, irregexp isn't affected, so Chrome is safe. The JavaScriptCore of WebKit has a similar YARR though (<http://trac.webkit.org/browser/trunk/Source/JavaScriptCore/yarr/YarrJIT.cpp#L1211>), so it might be a good idea to send the patch also upstream to WebKit after the other overflow candidates have been checked.

@Aki: Yeah, I don't think YARR is exposed to web pages in Chrome. Although you never know if someone might add regex support to CSS or something else tedious, and suddenly expose it. Let us know if you find anything.
Perhaps Safari's JavaScript engine uses YARR?

Webkit bug has been filed ([comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=653672#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Reproducible crash at js::RegExp::executeInternal")). I can't access it so hopefully that means their security team is aware of the problem.

Gavin Barraclough has created a much better, more comprehensive fix over in the WebKit bug, so we should take this instead (his fix rebased to our tree). The plan is still synchronized landing on Thursday.

Didn't get an answer in the webkit bug, maybe will here:
If m\_alternative can be large enough to cause this bug aren't lines like
m\_checked += alternative->m\_minimumSize;
equally problematic (m\_checked is an int)?

Fx 6 has a much older import of Yarr, so the patch doesn't apply.

David, what do you think of fixing this for 6? Are the differences large, is there significant risk involved in porting here? If we do take this for 6 we should do it asap.

None of the code affected by the patch from Apple even exists in 6. I don't even know the cause of the bug in 6. We'd have to start from scratch. I recommend not fixing for 6.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.1.14, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products.
Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 6. (CVE-2011-2995)
Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight, Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor
Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and Marcia Knous
reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 6,
fixed in Firefox 7. (CVE-2011-2997)
MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that
a frame named "location" could shadow the window.location
object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. Because some
plugins use the value of window.location to determine the
page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the
plugin content access to another site or the local file
system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
(CVE-2011-2999)
MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that
when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect
response Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers:
Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome
and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of
this header with different values could be a symptom of a
CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most
commonly it is the Location header itself that is
vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy
preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious
one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server
vulnerability.
The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two
copies of this header with different values as an error
condition. The same has been done with the headers
Content-Length and Content-Disposition. (CVE-2011-3000)
MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could
convince a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a
game or test, perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a
download dialog where the held key would then activate the
default Open action. For some file types this would be
merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a
vulnerability in applications not normally exposed to
potentially hostile internet content.
Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin
installation using the PLUGINSPAGE attribute. It was
possible to create an internal error that suppressed a
confirmation dialog, such that holding enter would lead to
the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant did
not affect Firefox 3.6)
Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to
Download Manager (CVE-2011-2372)
Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation
(CVE-2011-3001)
MFSA 2011-42: Security researcher Aki Helin reported a
potentially exploitable crash in the YARR regular
expression library used by JavaScript. (CVE-2011-3232)
MFSA 2011-44: sczimmer reported that Firefox crashed when
loading a particular .ogg file. This was due to a
use-after-free condition and could potentially be exploited
to install malware. (CVE-2011-3005)
This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6 or earlier.
