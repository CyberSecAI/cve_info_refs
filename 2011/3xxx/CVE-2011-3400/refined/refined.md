CVE-2011-3400:

- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability is caused by incorrect handling of OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects in memory.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of OLE objects in memory
- Impact of exploitation: Remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain the same user rights as the local user, potentially taking complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative privileges. This could lead to the installation of programs; viewing, changing, or deleting data; or creating new accounts with full user rights.
- Attack vectors: User interaction is required. The vulnerability can be exploited when a user opens a file (e.g., email attachment) containing a specially crafted OLE object. Various file types, including Office documents and third-party files, can contain malicious OLE objects.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to create a malicious file with a specially crafted OLE object and get the victim to open it. They do not need to be on the same network.
