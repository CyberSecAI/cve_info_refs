Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3666

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect fix in Firefox 3.6 for Mac OS X regarding how it handles .jar files. The initial fix, intended to treat .jar files as executables (due to Java treating them as "Applications"), was not correctly implemented on Mac, leaving them vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Firefox 3.6 on Mac OS X was not correctly treating downloaded .jar files as executables, as intended by the fix for MFSA 2011-40. This meant that the browser did not restrict the permissions of .jar files, allowing them to run with more privileges than intended for in-browser "Applets."
- The core issue was that the logic for handling executable files was not consistently applied across platforms, specifically within the `nsLocalFileOSX.mm` component for Mac OS X in the 1.9.2 branch, which was not yet merged into `nsLocalFileUnix.cpp`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By not correctly identifying .jar files as executables and not applying appropriate restrictions, an attacker could potentially run malicious Java code with the privileges of a full application rather than a limited applet. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on a user's system by downloading a crafted .jar file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A user would have to download a malicious `.jar` file.
- The user does not need to "open" the downloaded file, it would be enough to simply download it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to craft a malicious `.jar` file.
- The attacker needs to lure the victim into downloading the crafted `.jar` file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved copying the logic for checking executable file extensions from `nsLocalFileUnix.cpp` to `nsLocalFileOSX.mm` on the 1.9.2 branch.
*   The issue was specific to the 1.9.2 branch of Firefox (Firefox 3.6) on Mac OS X, as the fix for the main branch had addressed it correctly.
* The bug was also present in Thunderbird 3.1
*   The fix was released in Firefox 3.6.25 and Thunderbird 3.1.17.
