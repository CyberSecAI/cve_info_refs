### Bug Description

Hey,

as you were on CC: I guess you're already aware, but reporting so it can be tracked upstream.

Short version: <http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q3/393>

Long version: .dmrc and Xauthority files are written by lightdm running as root while they're in user controlled folders. An user can, via a symlink, overwrite root-owned files. It doesn't look like it can achieve easily privilege-escalation (since the content is quite fixed) but it's still bad.

Basically the correct fix seems to have workers process which would setuid() to the user before writing content to those files.

CVE-2011-3349

I can replicate the bug with creating a root owned /rootfile and ln -s /rootfile ~/.Xauthority. lightdm changes /rootfile then.

Writing ~/.dmrc uses g\_file\_set\_contents() which is safe against symlink attacks. However, it's still more robust to drop privileges instead of chown()ing.

Subject: [oss-security] lightdm issues

Hi,

lightdm (0.9.2) which aims to be a xdm replacement seems to
fall into the same pitfalls like kdm and gdm recently. There is
a lot of uid 0 code creating and chown()ing files in user dirs such as
for ~/.dmrc and ~/.Xauthority. Probably more, depending on
how the permissions of cache and log directories are set up. For example
process_start() also creates and chown()s logfiles on users behalf.

There is also one thing that I dont understand about the lightdm
user itself and why pam sessions seem to be started for it inside
the greeter session code.

The xdmcp code seems to be OK so far, after a quick review.

Cheers,
        Moritz

Yup, I'm on oss-sec so I've seen this and am waiting for Robert answer.

I guess the proper way to do it would be to move all the user-related
work *after* the setuid() call and before exec()ing the session
wrapper.
Not sure how gdm3/xdm/slim handle that but there might be inspiration
there too.

And, out of curiosity, how would you achieve privilege escalation? You
should be able to erase/rewrite arbitrary files, including /etc/shadow,
but you don't really have control on what's written there.

In gdm ([CVE-2011-0727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0727) I guess) the issue was that a g_file_copy() was
run as root from files under user control (.dmrc and the avatar), to a
cache dir with write permissions (afaict). So it was easy to put
whatever stuff you need in the original file and make a symlink
to /etc/shadow in the destination folder so the g_file_copy() would
erase that:

                 res = g_file_copy (src_file,
                                    dst_file,
                                    G_FILE_COPY_OVERWRITE |
                                    G_FILE_COPY_NOFOLLOW_SYMLINKS,
                                    NULL,
                                    NULL,
                                    NULL,
                                    &error);

I'm not too sure what G_FILE_COPY_OVERWRITE means, if it truncate()s and
write over of if it unlink()s and start fresh (digging in glib to find
out). Apparenlty in the fallback case (not sure if it's the case here)
it ends up doing a g_file_replace()).

In any case, in lightdm case, for .Xauthority file it uses
g_file_replace() which creates a temporary file and then rename over the
new file, so in the worst case you overwrite a system file with
xauthority data.

Same thing for .dmrc, you can overwrite system files but with dmrc data
which look like

[Desktop]
Session=xfce
Lang=fr_FR.UTF-8

so it doesn't look easy to gain root access with that.

LightDM maintains a cache for dmrc files in /var/cache/lightdm but the
folder is created 0700 so it doesn't look like one can put symlinks
there and have it use a user-controled .dmrc.

All in all, I'm not too sure there's a privilege escalation for
Xauthority/.dmrc files (but if one exists, I'm interested in how to do
it, by curiosity). But you still damage pretty much any arbitrary file,
which is still an easy DoS.

Hi,

You probably dont take into account the chown() that happens in lightdm.
Just unlink the created ~/.dmrc or ~/.Xauthority files after creation and make a symlink
to /etc/passwd to chown it to yourself.
However I didnt dig deep enough into it to write an exploit as I dont have
a working lightdm setup. The correct behavior is to temporarily drop euid/fsuid
to that of the user if doing anything with his files.

The PAM issue that I was curious about was that a pam_start() etc is done
for the greeter-user (which I expect to be some "lightdm" user)?

I would expect all pam_ calls are only done for the user who is actually
about to login. The question that came up to me was whether pam_environment
from the user would have impact on uid-0 called programs/scripts since
you transfer the PAM env to the process env.

The chown will be applied to the symlink, not the target. I've tried to
make .Xauthority a symlink to a root-owned file and the destination was
indeed destroyed, but it's still root-owned.

Yeah, I'm currently cooking patches doing that, though they'll need
review before apply.

Yeah, that looks fishy, though I have no idea how it's exactly cooked
that way, we'll have to wait for an answer from Robert.

Ok that's wrong, chown() is supposed to dereference symlinks, so I'm not
sure why the target file wasn't chown()ed in my case.

I've tried replacing .dmrc by a symlink to a root-owned file and, in
that case:

* the target file disappeared
* the symlink disappeared
* a new .dmrc file was written, belonging to my user

so the net result is that you can simply erase any root-owned file in
that case (but not overwrite it with arbitrary content, afaict).

You also need to switch gid and groups, and you do not have to fork() if
you only switch euid/egid/groups or fsuid/fsgid/groups.  The latter may
be less portable, but at least on Linux it affects only the current
thread in a multi-threaded process.  Probably this difference is
irrelevant in your case, though.

Here's an example:

<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=pam_modutil_priv>

A tricky part is what to do when you have partially switched credentials
and one of the syscalls fails (e.g., you've switched the gid but not yet
the uid).  The code referenced above (Linux-PAM commit) tries to restore
the old credentials, but ignores possible failure to do so.  A better
action might be to terminate the current process on failure to restore
old credentials.

>          path = g_build_filename (user_get_home_directory (user), ".dmrc", NULL);
>          g_file_set_contents (path, data, length, NULL);
> -        if (getuid () == 0 && chown (path, user_get_uid (user), user_get_gid (user)) < 0)
> -            g_warning ("Error setting ownership on %s: %s", path, strerror (errno));
>          g_free (path);
> +        _exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
> +
> +      }
> +      if (pid > 0)
> +        wait(NULL);
>      }

You're lucky that you don't seem to need to pass the result of
g_file_set_contents() back to the parent process.  If you were reading
rather than writing a file, you'd have difficulty using the fork()
approach.  However, in your case fork() may actually be fine (but you do
need to drop gid and groups as well).

I hope this helps.

Changes:
 lightdm (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream release:
     - don't write user files as root to prevent symlinks attacks
       [[CVE-2011-3349](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3349)]                                           closes: #[639151](bugreport.cgi?bug=639151)
   * debian/patches:
     - 01_set-default-path, 02_default-config, 03_quit-plymouth,
       04_default-gtk-greeter-config refreshed.
     - 05_always-export-XAUTHORITY dropped, included upstream.
     - 05_dont-add-pkglibexecdir-path added, don't add /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm
       to the PATH, it's ugly.
   * debian/rules:
     - don't install gdmflexiserver script for now until the PATH issue is
       solved.
   * debian/lightdm.install
     - install lightdm-set-default and dm-tool there.
   * debian/lightdm-{gtk,qt}-greeter.{config,templates,postinst,prerm}:
     - provide a way to select the current greeter through debconf. Other
       packages providing a greeter use the same templates/config to register
       themselves in debconf.
   * debian/control:
     - add suggests on accountsservice.

lightdm before 0.9.6 writes in .dmrc and Xauthority files using root
permissions while the files are in user controlled folders. A local user
can overwrite root-owned files via a symlink, which can allow possible
privilege escalation.

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Subject: [oss-security] lightdm issues

Hi,

lightdm (0.9.2) which aims to be a xdm replacement seems to
fall into the same pitfalls like kdm and gdm recently. There is
a lot of uid 0 code creating and chown()ing files in user dirs such as
for ~/.dmrc and ~/.Xauthority. Probably more, depending on
how the permissions of cache and log directories are set up. For example
process_start() also creates and chown()s logfiles on users behalf.

There is also one thing that I dont understand about the lightdm
user itself and why pam sessions seem to be started for it inside
the greeter session code.

The xdmcp code seems to be OK so far, after a quick review.

---

Cheers,
        Moritz

Yup, I'm on oss-sec so I've seen this and am waiting for Robert answer.

I guess the proper way to do it would be to move all the user-related
work *after* the setuid() call and before exec()ing the session
wrapper.
Not sure how gdm3/xdm/slim handle that but there might be inspiration
there too.

And, out of curiosity, how would you achieve privilege escalation? You
should be able to erase/rewrite arbitrary files, including /etc/shadow,
but you don't really have control on what's written there.

In gdm ([CVE-2011-0727](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0727) I guess) the issue was that a g_file_copy() was
run as root from files under user control (.dmrc and the avatar), to a
cache dir with write permissions (afaict). So it was easy to put
whatever stuff you need in the original file and make a symlink
to /etc/shadow in the destination folder so the g_file_copy() would
erase that:

                 res = g_file_copy (src_file,
                                    dst_file,
                                    G_FILE_COPY_OVERWRITE |
                                    G_FILE_COPY_NOFOLLOW_SYMLINKS,
                                    NULL,
                                    NULL,
                                    NULL,
                                    &error);

I'm not too sure what G_FILE_COPY_OVERWRITE means, if it truncate()s and
write over of if it unlink()s and start fresh (digging in glib to find
out). Apparenlty in the fallback case (not sure if it's the case here)
it ends up doing a g_file_replace()).

In any case, in lightdm case, for .Xauthority file it uses
g_file_replace() which creates a temporary file and then rename over the
new file, so in the worst case you overwrite a system file with
xauthority data.

Same thing for .dmrc, you can overwrite system files but with dmrc data
which look like

[Desktop]
Session=xfce
Lang=fr_FR.UTF-8

so it doesn't look easy to gain root access with that.

LightDM maintains a cache for dmrc files in /var/cache/lightdm but the
folder is created 0700 so it doesn't look like one can put symlinks
there and have it use a user-controled .dmrc.

All in all, I'm not too sure there's a privilege escalation for
Xauthority/.dmrc files (but if one exists, I'm interested in how to do
it, by curiosity). But you still damage pretty much any arbitrary file,
which is still an easy DoS.

Hi,

You probably dont take into account the chown() that happens in lightdm.
Just unlink the created ~/.dmrc or ~/.Xauthority files after creation and make a symlink
to /etc/passwd to chown it to yourself.
However I didnt dig deep enough into it to write an exploit as I dont have
a working lightdm setup. The correct behavior is to temporarily drop euid/fsuid
to that of the user if doing anything with his files.

The PAM issue that I was curious about was that a pam_start() etc is done
for the greeter-user (which I expect to be some "lightdm" user)?

I would expect all pam_ calls are only done for the user who is actually
about to login. The question that came up to me was whether pam_environment
from the user would have impact on uid-0 called programs/scripts since
you transfer the PAM env to the process env.

The chown will be applied to the symlink, not the target. I've tried to
make .Xauthority a symlink to a root-owned file and the destination was
indeed destroyed, but it's still root-owned.

Yeah, I'm currently cooking patches doing that, though they'll need
review before apply.

Yeah, that looks fishy, though I have no idea how it's exactly cooked
that way, we'll have to wait for an answer from Robert.

Ok that's wrong, chown() is supposed to dereference symlinks, so I'm not
sure why the target file wasn't chown()ed in my case.

I've tried replacing .dmrc by a symlink to a root-owned file and, in
that case:

* the target file disappeared
* the symlink disappeared
* a new .dmrc file was written, belonging to my user

so the net result is that you can simply erase any root-owned file in
that case (but not overwrite it with arbitrary content, afaict).

Hi,

I haven't been watching this discussion closely, but here are some
comments that might be of help:

You also need to switch gid and groups, and you do not have to fork() if
you only switch euid/egid/groups or fsuid/fsgid/groups.  The latter may
be less portable, but at least on Linux it affects only the current
thread in a multi-threaded process.  Probably this difference is
irrelevant in your case, though.

Here's an example:

<http://git.altlinux.org/people/ldv/packages/?p=pam.git;a=commitdiff;h=pam_modutil_priv>

A tricky part is what to do when you have partially switched credentials
and one of the syscalls fails (e.g., you've switched the gid but not yet
the uid).  The code referenced above (Linux-PAM commit) tries to restore
the old credentials, but ignores possible failure to do so.  A better
action might be to terminate the current process on failure to restore
old credentials.

You're lucky that you don't seem to need to pass the result of
g_file_set_contents() back to the parent process.  If you were reading
rather than writing a file, you'd have difficulty using the fork()
approach.  However, in your case fork() may actually be fine (but you do
need to drop gid and groups as well).

I hope this helps.

Changes:
 lightdm (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low
 .
   * New upstream release:
     - don't write user files as root to prevent symlinks attacks
       [[CVE-2011-3349](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3349)]                                           closes: #[639151](bugreport.cgi?bug=639151)
   * debian/patches:
     - 01_set-default-path, 02_default-config, 03_quit-plymouth,
       04_default-gtk-greeter-config refreshed.
     - 05_always-export-XAUTHORITY dropped, included upstream.
     - 05_dont-add-pkglibexecdir-path added, don't add /usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm
       to the PATH, it's ugly.
   * debian/rules:
     - don't install gdmflexiserver script for now until the PATH issue is
       solved.
   * debian/lightdm.install
     - install lightdm-set-default and dm-tool there.
   * debian/lightdm-{gtk,qt}-greeter.{config,templates,postinst,prerm}:
     - provide a way to select the current greeter through debconf. Other
       packages providing a greeter use the same templates/config to register
       themselves in debconf.
   * debian/control:
     - add suggests on accountsservice.

# lightdm issues

---

*From*: Sebastian Krahmer <krahmer () suse de>

*Date*: Wed, 24 Aug 2011 16:08:27 +0200

```
Hi,

lightdm (0.9.2) which aims to be a xdm replacement seems to
fall into the same pitfalls like kdm and gdm recently. There is
a lot of uid 0 code creating and chown()ing files in user dirs such as
for ~/.dmrc and ~/.Xauthority. Probably more, depending on
how the permissions of cache and log directories are set up. For example
process_start() also creates and chown()s logfiles on users behalf.

There is also one thing that I dont understand about the lightdm
user itself and why pam sessions seem to be started for it inside
the greeter session code.

The xdmcp code seems to be OK so far, after a quick review.

l8er,
-s
