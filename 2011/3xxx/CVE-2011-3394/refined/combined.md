MYRE Real Estate Software Multiple XSS and SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
SecPod Technologies (www.secpod.com)
Author: Sooraj K.S
###############################################################################
SecPod ID: 1020 20/07/2011 Issue Discovered
03/08/2011 Vendor Notified
No Response from Vendor
07/09/2011 Advisory Released
Class: Cross-Site Scripting / SQL Injection Severity: High
Overview:
---------
MYRE Real Estate Software is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL
injection vulnerabilities.
Technical Description:
----------------------
MYRE Real Estate Software is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL
injection vulnerabilities because it fails to properly sanitise user-supplied
input.
1) Input passed to the 'page' parameter in findagent.php is not properly
sanitised before being used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate
SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code.
2) Input passed to the 'country1', 'state1', and 'city1' parameters in
findagent.php is not properly verified before it is returned to the user.
This can be exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's
browser session in the context of a vulnerable site. This may allow the
attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials and to launch
other attacks.
Impact:
--------
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal cookie-based
authentication credentials, compromise the application, access or modify
data, or exploit latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
Affected Software:
------------------
MYRE Real Estate Software
Reference:
---------
http://myrephp.com
http://secpod.org/blog/?p=346
http://secpod.org/advisories/SECPOD\_MRS\_SQL\_XSS\_Vuln.txt
Proof of Concept:
-----------------
1) SQL Injection
http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?page='
2) XSS
(a) http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?country1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
(b) http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?country1=&state1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
(c) http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?country1=&state1=&city1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>
Solution:
----------
Fix not available
Risk Factor:
-------------
CVSS Score Report:
ACCESS\_VECTOR = NETWORK
ACCESS\_COMPLEXITY = LOW
AUTHENTICATION = NONE
CONFIDENTIALITY\_IMPACT = PARTIAL
INTEGRITY\_IMPACT = PARTIAL
AVAILABILITY\_IMPACT = PARTIAL
EXPLOITABILITY = PROOF\_OF\_CONCEPT
REMEDIATION\_LEVEL = UNAVAILABLE
REPORT\_CONFIDENCE = CONFIRMED
CVSS Base Score = 7.5 (HIGH) (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)
