Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3394:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The MYRE Real Estate Software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `findagent.php` script. Specifically, the parameters `page`, `country1`, `state1`, and `city1` are not correctly validated or escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `page` parameter in `findagent.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection. This occurs because the input is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `country1`, `state1`, and `city1` parameters in `findagent.php` are vulnerable to XSS. The application echoes these parameters back to the user without proper sanitization, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:**
    - An attacker can manipulate SQL queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data, modification of data, or exploitation of latent vulnerabilities in the underlying database.
- **XSS:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary HTML and script code in the victim's browser session, within the context of the vulnerable site.
    - This could enable the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.
    - This could also be used to launch other attacks against the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SQL Injection:** By crafting malicious SQL code within the `page` parameter of the `findagent.php` script. For example, `http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?page='`
- **XSS:** By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the `country1`, `state1`, or `city1` parameters of the `findagent.php` script. For example:
  - `http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?country1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`
  - `http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?country1=&state1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`
  - `http://myrephp.com/realestate/findagent.php?country1=&state1=&city1=<script>alert(/XSS/)</script>`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** The vulnerabilities are accessible remotely and do not require prior authentication.
- Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Sooraj K.S of SecPod Technologies.
- The vendor was notified but did not respond.
- CVSS score is 7.5 (High) with an attack vector of Network, Low attack complexity, no authentication and Partial impact for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

**Affected Software:**
- MYRE Real Estate Software
