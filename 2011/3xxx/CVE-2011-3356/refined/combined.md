How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hi team,

A security update is needed for current mantis stable version
(1.1.8+dfsg-10). (The CVE is not yet published)

I have prepared new version (1.1.8+dfsg-10squeeze1).

A multiple XSS/LFI and remote arbitrary code execution vulnerabilites
have been discovered which will work against all 1.2.x releases of MantisBT

1) XSS injection via PHP_SELF
2) LFI and XSS via bug_actiongroup pages
3) XSS issues with unescaped os, os_build and platform parameters on
bug_report_page.php and bug_update_advanced_page.php

Details of these vulnerabilities are provided at [1], [2] and [3]. CVE
requests have been submitted to the oss-security mailing list as per
[1].

*About debian versions*

mantis | 1.2.6-1            | wheezy
mantis | 1.2.7-1            | sid

1.2.7-1 includes all needed fixes for these vulnerabilites.
wheezy update is ongoing and tomorrow will be completed.

mantis | 1.1.8+dfsg-10      | squeeze
Is only affected by 2) LFI and XSS via bug_actiongroup pages

mantis | 1.1.6+dfsg-2lenny4 | lenny
Is only affected by 1) XSS injection via PHP_SELF

I've just prepared the new security package
(mantis_1.1.8+dfsg-10squeeze1) and your revision and confirmation to
upload is needed. A debdiff file is attached to this message.

Now I'm working in 1.1.6 security version to solved these issues, in
colaboration with MantisBT Team. Within a few days I will send the
security update for old-stable.

Please advise if assistance is required or you need more information.

Thanks in advance for your time.

Best regards,

Sils

# MantisBT: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201211-01**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in MantisBT, the worst of
which allowing for local file inclusion.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/mantisbt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.11** |

### Background

MantisBT is a PHP/MySQL/Web based bugtracking system.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MantisBT. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct
directory traversal attacks, disclose the contents of local files, inject
arbitrary web scripts, obtain sensitive information, bypass
authentication and intended access restrictions, or manipulate bugs and
attachments.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MantisBT users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-1.2.11"

```

Hi Sils and others,

Thank you for the quick response to bug #638321 (search.php multiple XSS
vulnerabilities in <mantisbt-1.2.7). Unfortunately a number of other
vulnerabilities have been discovered which will work against all 1.2.x
releases of MantisBT:

1) XSS injection via PHP_SELF
2) LFI and XSS via bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php
3) XSS issues with unescaped os, os_build and platform parameters on
bug_report_page.php and bug_update_advanced_page.php

Details of these vulnerabilities are provided at [1], [2] and [3]. CVE
requests have been submitted to the oss-security mailing list as per
[1].

The LFI vulnerability in bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php has the potential
to allow malicious users to upload arbitrary PHP scripts via MantisBT
bug attachments and then execute these malicious scripts. See
oss-security@lists.openwall.com and mantisbt-dev@lists.sourceforge.net
discussion threads for further information. Users would first need to
change the file upload method from storing attachments in the database
to storing them on the disk in order to be vulnerable to this extended
remote arbitrary code execution attack). However, if the same web server
uid/gid is used across multiple web applications, attachments stored on
the disk from another web application could be executed.

The minimum required patches to resolve these issues are available at
[4], [5], [6] and [7] and should apply cleanly to MantisBT 1.2.7
(probably 1.2.6 as well). The LFI patches ([4] and [5]) are a bit larger
than hoped for in a security fix. The do however aim to resolve the
issue in the most robust and future-proofed way possible.

Please advise if assistance is required in preparing alternative patches
for earlier versions of MantisBT. I'm able to help with resolving merge
conflicts, providing simpler bandaid patches, etc.

Thanks,

David Hicks

Subject: XSS vulnerability dues to usage of PHP\_SELF : Not fixed
Date: Mon, 05 Sep 2011 15:14:07 +0200
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=640297;msg=10) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Hi David,

Thanks a lot for the extended report about these issues [1] on debian BTS.

I took a look at code on github for the needed changes, I test them on
1.2.7 (which we are working on, instead of 1.2.6-1, which it would be
replace with 1.2.7). I create the patches from the minimum required code
to resolve these issues, and they were applied cleanly.

But the bugs were not fixed at all.

1) XSS injection via PHP_SELF ([2],[3])

The problem, sure, is related with PHP_SELF, but this patch [3] just fix
the setup/control of global variable $g_path. And do not solved the
problem in 1.2.6 or 1.2.7.

The XSS injection is continued producing, because of the function
"form_action_self". This function is used to generate a form action
value when forms are designed to be submitted to the same url.

core/form_api.php:function form_action_self()

This function affected to other functions as:
helper_ensure_confirmed()
auth_reauthenticate()

This function return:  basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);

In 1.2.7 release (1.2.6 too), this function is applied on this source:

core/authentication_api.php
core/helper_api.php
billing_inc.php
bugnote_stats_inc.php
manage_config_email_page.php
manage_config_workflow_page.php
manage_config_work_threshold_page.php

Then, all the pages which includes this function on 1.2.6/1.2.7 version
will be vulnerable.

I noticed, taking a look on github, that in master branch this function
had been deprecated (removed) from source code.

I could create a patch to solved this issue, but which one would be the
best solution?

a) remove the form_action_self() from all pages
b) change the form_action_self() in core/form_api.php

I don't know if we remove form_action_self() from all pages, would have
other implications or will crash something around the code. I just
compare 1.2.8 branch in github and I realized about it was removed.

I hope, this could help, and we wait for your reply, because we don't
want to spare much time with a open CVE issue in the package.

I offer me self to create this patch, don't worry about this, but I need
to know the implications or which is the best option.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Regards,

Sils

Hi Sils,

Thank you for debugging this issue further and discovering the
additional problem with form_action_self().

Agreed, good catch. I just grepped the source code and am troubled to
find PHP_SELF used in most of the libraries MantisBT 1.2.x depends upon:
JpGraph, NuSOAP and ADOdb. From my experience with these codebases I can
almost guarantee they will have issues with PHP_SELF usage. I'll have to
take a look at these in the following days to confirm.

> This function return:  basename($_SERVER['PHP_SELF']);

In this case, use of PHP_SELF is not really necessary because we're only
after the basename component (view_all_bugs.php, bug_report_page.php,
etc). While it's possible that users have setup rewrite rules within
their HTTP daemon to remap file names, this is an unlikely scenario and
is probably already broken with the use PHP_SELF.

> a) remove the form_action_self() from all pages

I think this would be hard to achieve because we'd have to change some
APIs within MantisBT 1.2.x (potentially breaking plugins) to pass
through form names.

> b) change the form_action_self() in core/form_api.php

This strikes me as being the easiest and safest approach (not breaking
anything else) for the 1.2.x branch.

I've created and committed a patch [1] that swaps PHP_SELF for
SCRIPT_NAME in this function. I've also gone through and applied proper
escaping to URLs in the action attribute where we use the return value
of form_action_self().

Agreed. Thank you very much for your help with these vulnerabilities.

Please let me know if I can be on any further assistance. Hopefully we
have all the patches needed in the master-1.2.x tree to resolve all
known outstanding vulnerabilities.

Regards,

David

Thanks David,

Everything works perfect. I apply all the patches, including the new one
(really appreciated), and all the issues are gone :-)

In a while I'm going to upload into the repo the 1.2.7-1 version to
close all these issues. No matter if tomorrow we have 1.2.8, I will push
it again :-)

BTW in debian package versions < 1.2.x (debian stable, old stable), all
these bugs are not applicable, I'm going to create the needed ones, If I
have some troubles I will ask for some help, if you don't mind, of course.

Thanks a lot, really.

Great job Team!

Cheers,

Sils

Subject: Re: CVE requests: <mantisbt-1.2.8 multiple
 vulnerabilities (1xLFI+XSS, 2xXSS)

Sorry this took so long.

----- Original Message -----
> Request #1: XSS injection via PHP_SELF
>
> Paulino Calderon from Websec reported an issue [2] against MantisBT 1.2.6
> whereby an attacker could craft URLs such that arbitrary HTML could be
> inserted into page output. Users running MantisBT on a vanilla nginx
> installation are unaffected because nginx will check to see whether the
> full URL path exists and is valid (with an XSS injection string, it won't
> be). Other web servers such as Apache won't perform these stringent
> checks and are therefore MantisBT is vulnerable to this attack when
> running on an Apache server. This attack does not require users to be
> authenticated or logged into a MantisBT installation to be impacted by
> this vulnerability.
>
> The same issue was identified by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab
> with their advisory #HTB23045 available at [1]. Paul Richards (MantisBT

Please use CVE-2011-3356 for the above.

>
> Request #2: LFI and XSS via bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php
>
> High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab reported an issue against MantisBT
> 1.2.7 whereby an attacker could include local system files via a
> directory traversal/local file inclusion vulnerability in
> bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php.
>
> Web server and/or PHP and/or operating system configuration will dictate
> whether this vulnerability can be exploited. MantisBT will prepend
> "bug_actiongroup_" prior to the attacker-supplied path. A suffix is
> appended, but can be stripped off using a null character (%00). Some
> environments (at least nginx and php-fpm 5.3) do not allow directory
> traversal from a file or invalid path/file. Other environments do allow
> directory traversal from file names (even invalid ones), for instance:
> "bug_actiongroup_page.php/../private_file" or
> "bug_actiongroup_/../private_file".
>
> This vulnerability can also allow an attacker to perform an XSS attack
> (no login/session required with the MantisBT attacker) if PHP is
> configured to display error messages. The error message from the
> require_once() call is not sanitised by PHP prior to displaying it to the
> user. Best (and therefore common) practice is to not display PHP error
> messages to the end user, severely limiting the applicability of this
> attack.
>
> Full details and patches are available at [3].

Please use CVE-2011-3357 for the above.

>
> Request #3: XSS issues with unescaped os, os_build and platform
> parameters on bug_report_page.php and bug_update_advanced_page.php
>
> High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab reported an issue against MantisBT
> 1.2.7 whereby an attacker could perform an XSS attack on users with
> access to either bug_report_page.php or bug_update_advanced_page.php. In
> default and typical MantisBT installations, this is limited to users that
> are currently logged in.
>
> The cause of this problem is with the use of the ancient Projax library
> (available at [4]) in the 1.2.x branch of MantisBT. Projax does not
> escape value attributes when printing input form elements. In some
> respects, this issue is also a bug with Projax however it may be a case
> that users of this library are expected to provide values that are
> already sanitised. MantisBT 1.3.x (master branch) uses jQuery instead of
> Projax and is therefore not impacted by this vulnerability.
>
> Full details and patches are available at [3].
>

Please use CVE-2011-3358 for the above.

>
>
> Additional information:
>
> A new release (mantisbt-1.2.8) is being put together and will be
> available shortly to download from mantisbt.org to resolve these 3

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Rework the bug action group api such that we can easily convert this …

…to an object in the future, and to validate calls to require once.

This leads to a security issue identified by IBM's Appscan program, whereby calls to require_once are not validated.
Depending on webserver configuration, this is a file inclusion vulnerability.

There will be a follow up commit to config api - probably:
-		if( $g_project_override != null ) {
+		if( $g_project_override != null && $p_project == null ) {

At the moment, the action group API calls config_get with a project parameter to use. This is ignored, due to project_override being set - so we either need to:
a) change project override within the command list function
b) modifify config api to only use the project override *if* it is attempting to look up information on the default project.

Backported from master-1.2.x branch. Note that this commit relies upon
commit [6dc3510](https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/6dc35105064e5a2533fb4e1de54426ea17d2ef36) from the master branch
(that hadn't been backported to 1.2.x).

I don't see any other way to do this safely, while taking into account the possibility for a HttpRewrite module within a web server translating paths outside of MantisBT's control.  I believe the issue is inside config\_defaults\_inc.php where we set path variables automatically based on PHP\_SELF. |

I'm not familiar with the matter but requiring administrators to manually set this configuration path would be a step backwards in usability. |

I've taken a closer look at the code in config\_defaults\_inc.php . The usage of $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF'] is limited to the calculation of $g\_short\_path.  I would suggest that we escape $\_SERVER['PHP\_SELF'], and add an upgrade / installation note regarding it. Administrators with special needs can simply set $g\_short\_path manually in config\_inc.php.  How does that sound? |

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab has also discovered and reported this issue in [0013281](/bugs/view.php?id=13281 "[closed] MantisBT Security Vulnerabilities Notification").

Message-ID: <1315113527.9806.54@d.hx.id.au>
Date: Sun, 04 Sep 2011 15:18:43 +1000
From: David Hicks <d@...id.au>

Subject: CVE requests: <mantisbt-1.2.8 multiple vulnerabilities (1xLFI+XSS,
 2xXSS)

Request #1: XSS injection via PHP_SELF

Paulino Calderon from Websec reported an issue [2] against MantisBT
1.2.6 whereby an attacker could craft URLs such that arbitrary HTML
could be inserted into page output. Users running MantisBT on a vanilla
nginx installation are unaffected because nginx will check to see
whether the full URL path exists and is valid (with an XSS injection
string, it won't be). Other web servers such as Apache won't perform
these stringent checks and are therefore MantisBT is vulnerable to this
attack when running on an Apache server. This attack does not require
users to be authenticated or logged into a MantisBT installation to be
impacted by this vulnerability.

The same issue was identified by High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab
with their advisory #HTB23045 available at [1]. Paul Richards (MantisBT
developer) also discovered this issue during a routine audit.

MantisBT bug reports with full details (including patches) are available
at [2] and [3].

Request #2: LFI and XSS via bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab reported an issue against
MantisBT 1.2.7 whereby an attacker could include local system files via
a directory traversal/local file inclusion vulnerability in
bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php.

Web server and/or PHP and/or operating system configuration will dictate
whether this vulnerability can be exploited. MantisBT will prepend
"bug_actiongroup_" prior to the attacker-supplied path. A suffix is
appended, but can be stripped off using a null character (%00). Some
environments (at least nginx and php-fpm 5.3) do not allow directory
traversal from a file or invalid path/file. Other environments do allow
directory traversal from file names (even invalid ones), for instance:
"bug_actiongroup_page.php/../private_file" or
"bug_actiongroup_/../private_file".

This vulnerability can also allow an attacker to perform an XSS attack
(no login/session required with the MantisBT attacker) if PHP is
configured to display error messages. The error message from the
require_once() call is not sanitised by PHP prior to displaying it to
the user. Best (and therefore common) practice is to not display PHP
error messages to the end user, severely limiting the applicability of
this attack.

Full details and patches are available at [3].

Request #3: XSS issues with unescaped os, os_build and platform
parameters on bug_report_page.php and bug_update_advanced_page.php

High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab reported an issue against
MantisBT 1.2.7 whereby an attacker could perform an XSS attack on users
with access to either bug_report_page.php or
bug_update_advanced_page.php. In default and typical MantisBT
installations, this is limited to users that are currently logged in.

The cause of this problem is with the use of the ancient Projax library
(available at [4]) in the 1.2.x branch of MantisBT. Projax does not
escape value attributes when printing input form elements. In some
respects, this issue is also a bug with Projax however it may be a case
that users of this library are expected to provide values that are
already sanitised. MantisBT 1.3.x (master branch) uses jQuery instead of
Projax and is therefore not impacted by this vulnerability.

Full details and patches are available at [3].

Additional information:

A new release (mantisbt-1.2.8) is being put together and will be
available shortly to download from mantisbt.org to resolve these 3
vulnerabilities. Announcements will be made to
mantisbt-announce@...ts.sourceforge.net, mantisbt.org/blog, #mantishelp
on irc.freenode.net and other usual channels. Major Linux distributions
shipping mantisbt-1.2.x will also be informed.

introduced previously by john attempting to fix symlinks. Since we now use php 5.2, we can make use of filter_var.

This is a simpler version of what we were trying to do previously aka <http://git.mantisforge.org/w/mantisbt.git?a=commitdiff;h=5ac1fdf32717d0c82cca7e7660dd4fd316a6a1b8>

Depending on server/mantis config this can lead to XSS issues

David: Backported from master branch and removed unreachable code branch.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-02 21:06:29 UTC  ``` A local file inclusion/path traversal vulnerability and XSS flaw was found in the Mantis bug tracker version 1.2.7 [1],[2].  [1] <https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/multiple_vulnerabilities_in_mantisbt.html> [2] <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/a7eacc181185eff1dd7bd8ceaa34a91cf86cc298>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-02 21:07:49 UTC  ``` Created mantis tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 731854](show_bug.cgi?id=731854 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - mantis various flaws [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 731855](show_bug.cgi?id=731855 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - mantis various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-06 22:28:49 UTC  ``` Version 1.2.8 has been released:  <http://www.mantisbt.org/blog/?p=146>  Also upgrading the severity based on the author's following comments:  I don't think my earlier message conveyed the severity of this bug well enough.  MantisBT allows users to upload attachments to bug reports. These attachments are commonly stored on the disk in an 'attachments' directory that should be stored outside the web root (but are still accessible to MantisBT for retrieval).  This LFI vulnerbility therefore allows arbitrary remote code execution on a target server (as the web user ID). This level of access could be used to connect to the MantisBT database and access files and configuration of other web applications operating under the same uid/gid as the MantisBT installation.  For example, this LFI vulnerability may allow an attacker to call: require_once('../var/www/example.com/data/mantisbt/attachments/123456-malicious_attachment.php')  Note that as per the earlier notice, some users (such as those using nginx) may not be impacted at all.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c3)  Gianluca Sforna    2011-09-07 08:45:28 UTC  ``` Starting the update process.  However, I need to note the impact of the flaw is not as severe for those using the default settings, that is, storing attachments in the database.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c4)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-09 23:22:15 UTC  ``` CVE assignments for flaws fixed in 1.2.8 are as follows:  CVE-2011-3356: XSS injection via PHP_SELF [1],[2] CVE-2011-3357: LFI and XSS via bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php [3] CVE-2011-3358: XSS issues with unescaped os, os_build and platform parameters on bug_report_page.php and bug_update_advanced_page.php [3]  [1] <https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/multiple_vulnerabilities_in_mantisbt.html> [2] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13191> [3] <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13281>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-21 19:28:24 UTC  ``` Another CVE assignment was made:   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-3578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3578) to the following vulnerability:  Name: [CVE-2011-3578](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3578) URL: <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3578> Assigned: 20110921 Reference: <http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/519547/100/0/threaded> Reference: <http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-tracker/2011/09/msg00012.html> Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/04/1> Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/04/2> Reference: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/09/9> Reference: <https://www.htbridge.ch/advisory/multiple_vulnerabilities_in_mantisbt.html> Reference: <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=640297> Reference: <http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=13281> Reference: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=735514](show_bug.cgi?id=735514 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-3356 CVE-2011-3357 CVE-2011-3358 CVE-2011-3578 mantis: multiple flaws fixed in 1.2.8") Reference: <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/5b93161f3ece2f73410c296fed8522f6475d273d> Reference: <https://github.com/mantisbt/mantisbt/commit/6ede60d3db9e202044f135001589cce941ff6f0f> Reference: <http://www.debian.org/security/2011/dsa-2308> Reference: <http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-September/066061.html> Reference: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/49448> Reference: <http://secunia.com/advisories/45961>  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php in MantisBT before 1.2.8 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the action parameter, related to bug_actiongroup_page.php, a different vulnerability than [CVE-2011-3357](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3357).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-08-10 19:00:52 UTC  ``` Currently supported Fedora versions have 1.2.8, which include the fix.  EPEL5's 1.1.8 may yet be affected by (or a subset of) these issues.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=735514#c7)  Vincent Danen    2013-03-15 04:17:51 UTC  ``` EPEL5 hasn't been touched since Dec 2010, and the package is technically orphaned.  As a result I'm closing this bug as this issue is fixed in Fedora.  The EPEL5 tracking [bug #800667](show_bug.cgi?id=800667 "CLOSED ERRATA - mantis: many security flaws [epel-5]") will remain open until either mantis is dropped from EPEL or it is fixed.   ``` |  |
