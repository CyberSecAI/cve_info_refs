{
  "CVE-2011-3356": {
    "Root cause": "Improper sanitization of the PHP_SELF variable.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could craft URLs that inject arbitrary HTML into page output, potentially leading to malicious code execution within the user's browser session.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafting malicious URLs.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated."
  },
  "CVE-2011-3357": {
    "Root cause": "Lack of proper input sanitization in `bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php` leading to local file inclusion.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Local file inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.",
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could include local system files via directory traversal. Additionally, if PHP error messages are displayed to the user, an XSS attack can be performed due to unsanitized error messages from `require_once()` function.",
    "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the 'action' GET parameter in `bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php`",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated. Successful exploitation may depend on server configuration."
  },
    "CVE-2011-3358": {
    "Root cause": "Use of the Projax library that does not escape value attributes in HTML form elements.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could perform an XSS attack on users with access to `bug_report_page.php` or `bug_update_advanced_page.php`, allowing for arbitrary HTML/script execution within a user's browser session.",
    "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the 'os', 'os_build' and 'platform' parameters in `bug_report_page.php` and `bug_update_advanced_page.php`.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a logged-in user with access to the vulnerable pages."
  },
   "CVE-2011-3578": {
    "Root cause": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in bug_actiongroup_ext_page.php",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the action parameter.",
