Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   HTC introduced a suite of logging tools (specifically, `HtcLoggers.apk`) in some of its devices' firmware. These tools collect a large amount of sensitive user data.
*   The collected data is exposed through a local port, accessible by any application with the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission. This permission is commonly requested by apps for internet access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Excessive Data Collection:** The `HtcLoggers.apk` collects an extensive amount of user data, including:
    *   List of user accounts, including email addresses and sync status.
    *   Last known network and GPS locations and limited history.
    *   Phone numbers from the phone log.
    *   SMS data (phone numbers and encoded text).
    *   System logs (kernel/dmesg and app/logcat).
    *   Active notifications, build, bootloader, radio, and kernel versions.
    *   Network info, full memory info, CPU info, file system info.
    *   Running processes, stack traces, list of installed apps with permissions, user IDs, versions.
    *   System properties/variables, active broadcast listeners, content providers, and battery information.
*   **Insecure Data Access:** The collected data is not properly secured and can be accessed by any application that requests the `android.permission.INTERNET` permission.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The HtcLogger application's interface doesn't require login credentials, allowing any app with internet access to communicate with it.
*   **Potential Root Exploitation:** The HtcLogger attempts to use root privileges to access more data and execute system commands.
*  **VNC Server:** The presence of `androidvncserver.apk` opens the door for potential remote access to the phone, although not active by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Breach:** Sensitive user data like email addresses, SMS messages, phone logs, and location history can be easily accessed and potentially leaked.
*   **Device Cloning:** A substantial amount of device data is exposed which could theoretically allow for device cloning.
*   **Remote Access:**  While not immediately exploitable, the presence of a VNC server could lead to remote access.
*   **Data Theft:** Malicious apps can silently capture the data and send it to remote servers without the user's knowledge.
*   **Further Compromise:** Once an attacker gains access, the sensitive system data can be used to further compromise the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** An attacker can create a seemingly harmless app (e.g. a game) and request the `android.permission.INTERNET`, which is often seen as normal and not suspicious.
*   **Compromised Application:** Existing, seemingly trustworthy apps could be updated with malicious code to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to publish an app to the app store or be able to get a user to sideload the application.**
*   **Basic understanding of Android permissions.**
*   **No need for root access:** the vulnerability is exploitable by a non-rooted application.
*   **No specific user interaction:** the data is passively collected and accessible.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was found in devices running stock HTC Sense firmware.
*   The article mentions that custom ROMs like CyanogenMod are not affected.
*   A proof-of-concept app was created to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   A list of affected devices was provided, which includes:
    *   EVO 4G
    *   EVO 3D
    *   Thunderbolt
    *   Possibly EVO Shift 4G, MyTouch 4G Slide, Vigor, some Sensations, View 4G, and the upcoming Kingdom devices.
*   The vulnerability was reported to HTC before the public disclosure, and HTC has acknowledged the issue and promised a patch.
