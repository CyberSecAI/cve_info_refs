**Content Analysis**

The email thread discusses a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla, specifically version 1.6.1 and lower, and also references similar issues across various PHP CMS applications.  The initial email requests a CVE for a Joomla information disclosure vulnerability, and the assigned CVE is CVE-2011-2488, not CVE-2011-3736. The email refers to a blog post and an SVN repository that details multiple path disclosure vulnerabilities, including Joomla.

**Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is related to insecure handling of file paths, likely in error handling or other areas where file paths are exposed to users.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Path Disclosure Vulnerability - the application exposes the full server-side file system path in certain requests/errors.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which can be used to aid further attacks by identifying sensitive files or directories.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered through web requests that reveal server-side paths within the application's response (e.g., in error messages or through predictable file access).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Joomla application.
