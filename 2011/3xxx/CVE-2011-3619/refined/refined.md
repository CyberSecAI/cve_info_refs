{
  "CVE-2011-3619": {
    "Root cause": "A NULL pointer dereference occurs within the AppArmor security framework when invalid parameters are passed to `apparmor_setprocattr` during an attempt to record an audit message, because the profile parameter for `aa_audit` is NULL.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local denial of service (DoS) vulnerability that can cause the system to halt due to the kernel oops.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local process attempts to write invalid formatted data to its own `/proc/<pid>/attr/current` file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to write to their own `/proc/<pid>/attr/current` file, which is normally within the capabilities of any user running a process."
