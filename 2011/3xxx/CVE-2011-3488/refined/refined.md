- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly handle invalid or malformed files, leading to a use-after-free condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malformed MetaStock chart, template, or layout file (mwc/mws, mwt, mwl).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create or modify a MetaStock file with a specific malformed structure. The user must open this file with the vulnerable application to trigger the exploit.
