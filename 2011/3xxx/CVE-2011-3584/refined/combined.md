... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

# TYPO3-SA-2011-003: SQL Injection vulnerabilities in extension "WEC Discussion Forum" (wec\_discussion)

It has been discovered that the extension WEC Discussion Forum (wec\_discussion) is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

**Release Date:** April 7, 2011

**Component Type:** Third party extension. This extension is not a part of the TYPO3 default installation.

**Affected Versions:** Version 2.1.0 and all versions below

**Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection

**Severity:** High

**Suggested CVSS v2.0:** [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C](http://jvnrss.ise.chuo-u.ac.jp/jtg/cvss/cvss2.cgi?vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C)&g=2&lang=en "CVSS calculator") ([What's that?](http://buzz.typo3.org/teams/security/article/use-of-common-vulnerability-scoring-system-in-typo3-security-advisories/ "Blog post on CVSS usage"))

**Problem Description:** Failing to properly sanitize user-supplied input the extension is open to SQL Injection attacks. The vulnerabilities allow website visitors to inject arbitrary code in database queries.

**Solution:** An updated version 2.1.1 is available from the TYPO3 extension manager and at[http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/wec\_discussion/2.1.1/](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/wec_discussion/2.1.1/ "Opens external link in new window"). Users of the extension are advised to update the extension as soon as possible.

**Note:** The vulnerabilities are being exploited in the wild. Please update the extension wec\_discussion immediately when being used!

**Credits:** Credits go to Matthias Hunstock who discovered and reported the issue and TYPO3 Security Team members Sebastian Böttger, Helmut Hummel und Marcus Krause for preparing the security fix.

**General advice:** Follow the recommendations that are given in the [TYPO3 Security Cookbook](http://typo3.org/fileadmin/security-team/typo3_security_cookbook_v-0.5.pdf). Please subscribe to the[typo3-announce mailing list](http://lists.typo3.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/typo3-announce) to receive future Security Bulletins via E-mail.

Package: typo3-src
Severity: critical
Tags: security

Component Type: TYPO3 Core

Affected Versions: 4.2.0-4.2.17, 4.3.0-4.3.13, 4.5.0-4.5.5
Release Date: September 14, 2011

Vulnerable subcomponent: Caching System

Vulnerability Type: Improper error handling
Severity: Medium
Suggested CVSS v2.0: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C
Problem Description: When configured to explicitly deny cache disabling
through an URL parameter
($TYPO3_CONF_VARS['FE']['disableNoCacheParameter']), TYPO3 fails to
disable caching when an invalid cache hash URL parameter (cHash) is
provided. This allows an attacker to easily flood the caching tables of
TYPO3.
