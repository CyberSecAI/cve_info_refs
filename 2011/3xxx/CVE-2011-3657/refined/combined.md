This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=697699#c0)â€¢ 13 years ago |
|  | |

RedTeam Pentesting discovered a Cross Site-Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
in Bugzilla's chart generator during a penetration test. If attackers
can persuade users to click on a prepared link or redirected them to
such a link from an attacker-controlled website, they are able to run
arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Bugzilla installation's
domain.
Details
=======
Product: Bugzilla
Affected Versions: 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, 4.1.3,
possibly all older versions that can generate charts
Vulnerability Type: Cross Site Scripting
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: <http://www.bugzilla.org>
Vendor Status: notified
Advisory Status: private
More Details
============
The chart-generating script chart.cgi contains a function plot(), which
creates a new chart:
sub plot {
validateWidthAndHeight();
$vars->{'chart'} = new Bugzilla::Chart($cgi);
my $format = $template->get\_format("reports/chart", "", scalar($cgi->param('ctype')));
# Debugging PNGs is a pain; we need to be able to see the error messages
if ($cgi->param('debug')) {
print $cgi->header();
$vars->{'chart'}->dump();
}
print $cgi->header($format->{'ctype'});
disable\_utf8() if ($format->{'ctype'} =~ /^image\//);
$template->process($format->{'template'}, $vars)
|| ThrowTemplateError($template->error());
}
The function's code shows that there is a "debug" parameter, that, if
set, will make the function print out the variables (and their contents)
representing the chart for debugging purposes. This includes
user-defined variables sent as parameters, especially "label0". As the
content of this variable is not checked for malicious input, it can be
used to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the debugging output. In
fact, any variable of the form "labelXXX", where "XXX" is an arbitrary
number, will work.
Proof of Concept
================
The following URL generates a new chart with debugging output enabled,
containing JavaScript code in the "label0" parameter:
<http://www.example.org/bugzilla/chart.cgi>
?category=-All-
&datefrom=
&dateto=
&label0=<script>alert("XSS")</script>
&line0=1
&name=1
&subcategory=-All-
&ctype=png
&action=plot
&width=600
&height=350
&debug=1
Security Risk
=============
The risk of this vulnerability is estimated to be high. Being able to
embed arbitrary JavaScript allows attackers to completely manipulate the
website, adding one's own content and tracking user interaction.
RedTeam Pentesting GmbH
=======================
RedTeam Pentesting offers individual penetration tests, short pentests,
performed by a team of specialised IT-security experts. Hereby, security
weaknesses in company networks or products are uncovered and can be
fixed immediately.
As there are only few experts in this field, RedTeam Pentesting wants to
share its knowledge and enhance the public knowledge with research in
security related areas. The results are made available as public
security advisories.

Hey guys,
Thanks for reporting this. I wrote that code, quite some time ago :-| We have various protections in place to detect possible XSS for output coming from templates, but obviously if you just write "print" in a CGI, then... <sigh>

Sure, glad to help.
Our client also suggested that it'd be great if the hardcoded debugging output (there's more in other places, as I guess you know) could be made optional, as it's normally not needed in a production system and might only lead to problems like this. We didn't find any other problems in the debugging code, but it's always good to reduce your attack surface.

I just did a quick audit of all calls to "print" and "say" in the current codebase, and I've found one more confirmed instance of this - in report.cgi, lines 288-294. Same type of code, put there for the same reason, by the same person, with the same bug. :-| You can trigger it in that case by updating your Real Name to have a <script> tag in it, making e.g. Assignee Real Name one of the chart parameters, and then putting debug=1 on the end of your chart URL.

By "quick audit", I of course mean "possibly incomplete and should be repeated more thoroughly". I also did a search for other uses of Data::Dumper but couldn't immediately find any vulnerabilities.

Thanks for reporting, fixing, and reviewing this, everybody. I'm a little pressed for time until after Wednesday, but I will start planning to do a sec release for this shortly after that. If anybody else wants to file the relevant release bugs and do the sec adv, it would definitely speed up the process.

Hi,
as the last update is almost a month old: what's your current time schedule for releasing the fix? Any idea when this'll be officially announced?

We have no hard release date as we are still tracking some other blockers, but this should happen within a few weeks (I would say mid-December at the lastest, without guarantee). The patches in this bug will be committed right before the releases.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# 4.1.3, 4.0.2, 3.6.6, and 3.4.12 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Dec 28th, 2011
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When viewing tabular or graphical reports as well as new charts,
  an XSS vulnerability is possible in debug mode.

* The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method lets you create
  a new user account even if the active authentication method forbids
  users to create an account.

* A CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi and in attachment.cgi could
  lead to the creation of unwanted bug reports and attachments.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
Fixed In:    3.4.13, 3.6.7, 4.0.3, 4.2rc1
Description: Tabular and graphical reports, as well as new charts have
             a debug mode which displays raw data as plain text. This
             text is not correctly escaped and a crafted URL could
             use this vulnerability to inject code leading to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697699
CVE Number:  CVE-2011-3657

Class:       Unauthorized Account Creation
Affected:    2.23.3 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
Fixed In:    3.4.13, 3.6.7, 4.0.3, 4.2rc1
Description: The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method ignores
             the user_can_create_account setting of the authentication
             method and generates an email with a token in it which the
             user can use to create an account. Depending on the
             authentication method being active, this could allow the
             user to log in using this account.
             Installations where the createemailregexp parameter is
             empty are not vulnerable to this issue.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=711714
CVE Number:  CVE-2011-3667

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    2.0 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
Fixed In:    4.2rc1
Description: The creation of bug reports and of attachments is not
             protected by a token and so they can be created without
             the consent of a user if the relevant code is embedded
             in an HTML page and the user visits this page. This
             behavior was intentional to let third-party applications
             submit new bug reports and attachments easily. But as this
             behavior can be abused by a malicious user, it has been
             decided to block submissions with no valid token starting
             from version 4.2rc1. Older branches are not patched to not
             break these third-party applications after the upgrade.

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=703983
CVE Number:  CVE-2011-3668, CVE-2011-3669

Vulnerability Solutions
=======================

The fix for these issues is included in the
releases. Upgrading to a release with the relevant fix will
protect your installation from possible exploits of these issues.

If you are unable to upgrade but would like to patch just the security
vulnerability, there are patches available for the issues at the
"References" URL.
