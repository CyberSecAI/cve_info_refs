... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-03 13:52:13 UTC  ``` A DOM based cross-site scripting flaw was found in the way the administrative console of the JBoss Application Server processed some certain messages (the 'onerror' argument was not sanitized prior further use). A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted web page and trick the valid JBoss AS user, with the administrator privilege, to visit it, which would lead into the DOM environment modification and arbitrary HTML or web script execution.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-03 16:30:33 UTC  ```  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank David Black for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c4)  Jean-frederic Clere    2011-10-04 06:23:50 UTC  ``` Is there a more precise description of the flaw?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c6)  David    2011-10-04 10:38:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c4)) > Is there a more precise description of the flaw?  Sure. My original email wasn't copied into this bug report, so I will include parts of it below:  "It goes like this ... when you visit a page like  --> <http://localhost:9990/console/App.html>#<video onerror=alert(1) src="loaskdfjsaldfj">xxxx  an error is recorded (you can see this in console.log). While it doesn't trigger at this point(as it shouldn't). A "messages" button which you can click on .. and "view" the information about the failure will be shown( a "messages" button - at the bottom right of the page). In the respective pop up, (if clicked) the xss will be triggered. I have attached a screen-shot to show it triggering in the latest stable version of chrome using jboss 7.02 which I downloaded yesterday."  Please let me know if you would like the screen-shot which I sent in the email.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c7)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-04 10:50:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c6)) > (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c4)) > > Is there a more precise description of the flaw? >  > Sure. My original email wasn't copied into this bug report, so I will include > parts of it below: [..] > Please let me know if you would like the screen-shot which I sent in the email.  Hi David,    your original message was copied to this bug report too, but rather as private comment (just FYI). Jean-Frederic is already aware of it.  HTH Jan  P.S.: The screenshot was attached too.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c8)  David    2011-10-04 11:12:06 UTC  ``` AH ok.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c9)  Jean-frederic Clere    2011-10-05 09:09:03 UTC  ``` Hm I am not able to reproduce it with  jboss-as-7.1.0.Alpha2-SNAPSHOT which version are you testing?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c10)  David    2011-10-05 11:11:48 UTC  ``` I was testing jboss 7.02 (in chrome). If you are using firefox, you may need to switch the chrome/chromium to test it. Firefox and chrome can (depending on the method of access) provide different "values" for location.hash.   If it is accessed like this  -->  var something = location.href.split("#")[1] || "" ; chrome and firefox can provide different results.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c11)  Jean-frederic Clere    2011-10-05 13:14:31 UTC  ``` I can't reproduce it too. It uses gwt that is not my cup of tea. You should assign it to Heiko Braun and retest with a new chrome version (may be there is a problem there).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c12)  David Jorm    2011-10-06 07:48:00 UTC  ``` I can reproduce this issue on JBoss AS 7.0.2.Final and EAP 6.0.0.Alpha2 (AS 7.1.0.Alpha1-redhat-1). I think the line wrapping in BZ has confused the initial report. In the URL:  <http://localhost:9990/console/App.html>#<video onerror=alert(1) src="loaskdfjsaldfj">xxxx  There must be a space where the newline is: ...onerror=alert(1) src="...   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c14)  David Jorm    2011-10-07 02:13:14 UTC  ``` Has been fixed here: <https://github.com/heiko-braun/as7-console/commit/6e9146067cc05ea3c84305aa159d9c5036fe4383>  Will be included in AS 7.1 (or Console 1.0.0.Beta19)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c16)  David Jorm    2011-12-01 05:10:36 UTC  ``` This issue is now resolved in JBoss AS 7.1.0 Beta 1.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=742984#c17)  David Jorm    2011-12-02 03:41:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue only affects community JBoss AS 7 prior to 7.1.0 Beta 1. It does not affect components shipped with any Red Hat products.   ``` |  |

A DOM based cross-site scripting flaw was found in the JBoss Application
Server 7 before 7.1.0 Beta 1 administration console. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted web page and trick the valid JBoss AS
user, with the administrator privilege, to visit it, which would lead into
the DOM environment modification and arbitrary HTML or web script
execution.
