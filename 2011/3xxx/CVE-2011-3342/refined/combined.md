### CVE-2011-3342 (vulnerable 0.1.0 - fixed 1.1.3)

Short description: Buffer overflows in savegame loading

In multiple places indices in savegames are not properly validated that allow
(remote) attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

The bug is exploitable by passing someone a modified savegame, be it via a file
sharing site, or by running a server. In case of the server the user only has
to be able to login into the server, which is easy to accomplish: set no server
password and do not ban anyone. Then upon joining the server the savegame
will be downloaded and subsequently loaded.

Note that versions before 0.5.0 are vulnerable as well. However, these versions
are over five years old and not supported anymore. Therefore no patches for
earlier versions are provided. Before 0.3.5 it is not possible to exploit this
bug via the internet as multiplayer over internet did not exist yet.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Message-ID: <4E6144D2.4070905@icosahedron.de>
Date: Fri, 02 Sep 2011 23:04:18 +0200
From: Michael Lutz <michi+openttd@...sahedron.de>

Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hello folks,

the OpenTTD team and contributors have discovered several security
vulnerabilities in OpenTTD. Please be so kind to allocate a CVE id for
each of the issues detailed below:

1.) Denial of service via improperly validated commands

In multiple places in-game commands are not properly validated that allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Vulnerability is present since 0.3.5 and will be fixed in the upcoming
1.1.3 release. Issue report at <http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4745>

2.) Buffer overflows in savegame loading

In multiple places indices in savegames are not properly validated that
allow (remote) attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Vulnerability is present since 0.1.0 and will be fixed in the upcoming
1.1.3 release. Issue reports at <http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4717> and
<http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4748>

3.) Multiple buffer overflows in validation of external data

In multiple places external data from the local file system isn't properly
checked before allocating memory, which could lead to buffer overflows and
arbitrary code execution.

Vulnerability is present since 0.3.4 and will be fixed in the upcoming
1.1.3 release. Issue reports at <http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4746> and
<http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4747>

Once the CVE ids are allocated, each issue will be fully documented at
<http://security.openttd.org/en/CVE-2011-xxxx>

Thanks,
Michael Lutz

> \* PLYR: Too many old economy entries could previously be loaded; leads to heap overflow.

----- Original Message -----
> Hello folks,

> 1.) Denial of service via improperly validated commands

Use CVE-2011-3341 for the above.

>
> 2.) Buffer overflows in savegame loading

Use CVE-2011-3342 for the above.

>
> 3.) Multiple buffer overflows in validation of external data
>
> In multiple places external data from the local file system isn't
