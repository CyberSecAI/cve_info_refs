How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c0)  Martin Osvald 🛹    2011-08-02 17:51:19 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  If we send to syslog a specially crafted log message, stack guard variable protecting bufParseTAG array in parseLegacySyslogMsg() gets rewritten and rsyslog gets terminated.   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  rsyslog-4.6.2-3.el6_1.1.i686   How reproducible:  everytime on ia-32 on x86-64 stack guard variable won't get rewritten as it is located 8 bytes above bufParseTAG array   Actual results:  glibc prints the following message and rsyslog gets terminated:  *** stack smashing detected ***: rsyslogd terminated   Expected results:  No abortion.   Additional info:  For more info, please, see the following private comment.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c1)  Martin Osvald 🛹    2011-08-02 17:52:40 UTC  ``` ###############################################  The following is investigation of corefile from customer before finding the reproducer:  let's find the address of guard variable:  (gdb) disassemble parseLegacySyslogMsg ...    0x00d74fc1 <+33>:    mov    %gs:0x14,%eax    0x00d74fc7 <+39>:    mov    %eax,-0x1c(%ebp) ...    0x00d75048 <+168>:   mov    -0x1c(%ebp),%edx    0x00d7504b <+171>:   xor    %gs:0x14,%edx    0x00d75052 <+178>:   jne    0xd75411 <parseLegacySyslogMsg+1137> ...    0x00d75411 <+1137>:  call   0xda9140 <__stack_chk_fail_local>   from above we can see that it is stored 28 (0x1c) bytes below the base pointer and it is stored exactly above bufParseTAG array:  (gdb) f 12 #12 0x00d75416 in parseLegacySyslogMsg (pMsg=0xb4301338, flags=48) at syslogd.c:1322 1322    } (gdb) p &bufParseTAG $1 = (uchar (*)[512]) 0xb7871f4c (gdb) x/x 0xb7871f4c+512 0xb787214c:     0x45092900 (gdb) x/x $ebp-0x1c 0xb787214c:     0x45092900 (gdb)   If we look at the code which fills in the bufParseTAG buffer in parseLegacySyslogMsg() we can find the following code:  1189 int parseLegacySyslogMsg(msg_t *pMsg, int flags) 1190 { 1191         uchar *p2parse; 1192         int lenMsg; ... 1194         int i;  /* general index for parsing */ 1195         uchar bufParseTAG[CONF_TAG_MAXSIZE]; ... 1201         lenMsg = pMsg->iLenRawMsg - pMsg->offAfterPRI; /* note: offAfterPRI is already the number of PRI chars (do not add one!) */ ... 1240         if(bParseHOSTNAMEandTAG && !(flags & INTERNAL_MSG)) { ... 1293                 i = 0; 1294                 while(lenMsg > 0 && *p2parse != ':' && *p2parse != ' ' && i < CONF_TAG_MAXSIZE) { 1295                         bufParseTAG[i++] = *p2parse++; 1296                         --lenMsg; 1297                 } 1298                 if(lenMsg > 0 && *p2parse == ':') { 1299                         ++p2parse; 1300                         --lenMsg; 1301                         bufParseTAG[i++] = ':'; 1302                 } 1303  1304                 /* no TAG can only be detected if the message immediatly ends, in which case an empty TAG 1305                  * is considered OK.

I suspect SELinux would help us if it did.  At best this is a DoS since someone could use this to kill the system logger before doing other things (to help cover their tracks; especially useful if rsyslog is configured to send logs to a central log server).  I'm going to change this to an SRT bug since either way there is a vulnerability here.  Do we know if this can only be triggered locally, or if it can be triggered remotely as well?   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 08:47:48 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c1)) > which led to 'i' variable having a value of 512 at the end of above while loop > which finally led to overwriting 1 byte memory after bufParseTAG array with > zero: >  > 1307                 bufParseTAG[i] = '\0';  /* terminate string */  I think we can sum [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c1) as: the crash was caused by an off-by-one buffer overflow, which touched SSP guard cookie and resulted in SSP abort.  Well, it's actually off-by-two in some cases (see lines 1298 - 1301), but the overflow is limited to "\0" or ":\0".  Test with buf='<174>'+'#'*512+':' in your reproducer.  We should make the relevant info from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c1) public when this bug is opened.  (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c5)) > After thinking about this further, we just need confirmation as to whether or > not this can be used to cause arbitrary code execution since rsyslogd runs as > root.  The overflow is too short here.  When SSP is used, gcc changes order of the local variables.  Hence all other local variables in parseLegacySyslogMsg() will be placed below bufParseTAG[] (and bufParseHOSTNAME[]) and can not be overwritten.  Overflow can touch SSP cookie, or not even reach it (as noted in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c0)).  SSP mitigates to crash-only.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 08:50:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c2)) > I do not provide temporary fix even it would be consisted of restricting value > of 'i' variable after the line #1297  i < CONF_TAG_MAXSIZE - 2, similar to i < (CONF_HOSTNAME_MAXSIZE - 1) possibly?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c9)  Tomas Heinrich    2011-08-03 14:04:35 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c5)) > Do we know if this can only be triggered locally, or if it can be triggered > remotely as well?

Ok, then we should probably ASYNC this once we get the fully list of what it affects (to be sure that some variation of the reproducer doesn't work on RHEL5, etc.) and a patch.  We should also coordinate a release with other vendors who may be shipping this as killing syslog is a great way to hide your tracks if you're planning to attack something.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c11)  Martin Osvald 🛹    2011-08-03 22:02:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c10)) > Ok, then we should probably ASYNC this once we get the fully list of what it > affects (to be sure that some variation of the reproducer doesn't work on > RHEL5, etc.)  RHEL-4 doesn't ship rsyslog  just checked the RHEL-5 code and it cannot happen there. It doesn't iterate over buffer stored on the stack, but allocated by malloc. It doesn't use extra variable as index to access elements of the buffer nor variable holding a number of remaining bytes, but accesses it directly by incrementing a pointer until it reaches zero and as it allocates extra byte for terminating '\0' there isn't any alteration of memory past the buffer, the only problem I can see is that the while loop isn't restricted to stop after strlen(p2parse) iterations or the last byte of pBuf isn't zeroed.  rsyslog-3.22.1/tools/syslogd.c: 1404 static int parseLegacySyslogMsg(msg_t *pMsg, int flags) 1405 { 1406         char *p2parse; ... 1416         p2parse = (char*) pMsg->pszUxTradMsg; ... 1466                 if(pMsg->bParseHOSTNAME) { 1467                         /* TODO: quick and dirty memory allocation */ 1468                         /* the memory allocated is far too much in most cases.

Have you looked at Fedora?  Maybe then this is only something that affects 4.x; I couldn't get it to reproduce on F15 (5.8.2), but have not tried Fedora 14.  Have you looked into a patch for this, or has this been reported to upstream at all?  If not, we should probably get in touch with them; it looks like 4.x is still supported.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c13)  Martin Osvald 🛹    2011-08-05 02:03:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c12)) > Have you looked at Fedora?

Yes, on F-14 it is reproducible as it contains the same code as in RHEL6 (4.6.3), I can see that F-15 (5.8.2) also contains the wrong code, but it is little bit refactored so need to debug it first to see what is happening there, as soon as I get to it I will let you know if nobody will be faster than me.  > Have you looked into a patch for this  No, but I think Tomas's [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c9) could be reasonable solution.  > or has this been reported to upstream at all?  No, it hasn't been reported to anyone.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-08 14:29:05 UTC  ``` Adding upstream (Rainer) to the bug.  Rainer, this is currently non-public, so please do not make any public commits to any repos, etc. without first coordinating a release date to unembargo with us (so that we have an opportunity to inform other vendors who may be shipping rsyslog before it is made public, so that they have the opportunity to patch it beforehand as well).  We have a preliminary patch idea in [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c7); do you think that fix would work?  Also, we've so far only been able to reproduce this on 4.x, but Martin has looked briefly at 5.x ([comment #13](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c13)) and we're not sure if it is affected, perhaps in a different way (or if something else is preventing it from being a problem).  It does not look like 3.x is affected, but confirmation of that from you would be fantastic.  Thank you!   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c17)  Rainer Gerhards    2011-08-08 15:03:51 UTC  ``` Thanks for working with us in getting this fixed. I have just begun to dig into the details and will probably need tomorrow to get to a decent response. I'll also check the other important parser (RFC5424), which may have a similar issue. Will post when I have more info.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c18)  Rainer Gerhards    2011-08-08 15:39:56 UTC  ``` I have preliminary verified the problem in v4. The patch from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c7) is a temporary solution. The problematic code is definitely contained in v5 and v6. Even if it does not trigger an abort, the off-by-1/2 can happen there, too.   As far as I can quickly see, v3 is not affected as no limit for the tag was set there.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c19)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-10 20:23:50 UTC  ``` Adding the Debian maintainer Michael Biebl as per Rainer's request.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c20)  Rainer Gerhards    2011-08-11 10:45:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 517770](attachment.cgi?id=517770&action=diff "upstream fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=517770&action=edit "upstream fix") upstream fix  The patch is identical to what has already been proposed on this bug tracker. Note that tt will effectively reduce the max supported tag size by two. However, the max size was choosen more or less random as an upper bound which by far is never expected to be seen in practice. So this doesn't really matter. If there are concerns, the max size can be increased in ./runtime/rsyslog.h.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c21)  Rainer Gerhards    2011-08-11 11:23:19 UTC  ``` I have analyzed the problem in detail. First of all, this for sure is a bug that needs to be fixed. However, it seems to be very hard to reproduce. Actually, I did not manage on any other platform than described here.  It is hard to reproduce because it depends on many factors that need to go together. Let's have a look at the code (from ./tools/syslogd.c, current git v4-stable, ln 1189+):  1193         int i;  /* general index for parsing */ 1194         uchar bufParseTAG[CONF_TAG_MAXSIZE]; 1195         uchar bufParseHOSTNAME[CONF_HOSTNAME_MAXSIZE];  The buffer potentially overrun is bufParseTAG. Let's assume the compiler does not reorder variables. Then the following happens: (a) on most platforms, bufParseHOSTNAME is overrun. This is no problem, because it is no longer used when this happens. Also bufParseTAG is strcpy()'ed right away, so this causes no issue at all.  (b) on some platforms (I had none), variable i is partially overwritten. This index is used shortly thereafter. Truncation of TAG can happen, but no abort: (ba) on big endian machines, not follow-up error occurs, as the overwritten location continued 0 and the same value is written (bb) on little endian machines, the lowest byte is overwritten with zero, leading to a truncation of the tag value.  I have not analysed all possible permutations if the compiler reorders. But obviously, some of the them can cause problems. The most important cases are overwriting the parse pointer or, as seen here, the return address (if bufParseTAG is located right after it).  This rearrangement happens with stack guard. Without knowing the implementation details, it looks like stack guard seems to reorder EITHER bufParseTAG or bufParseHOSTNAME directly after the guard variable. If it is bufParseTAG, the overrun will be detected and an abort happens. However, if it is buf ParseHOSTNAME, the problem will neither be detected nor cause any damage (as described above). Thus the problem is not always reproducible even if stack guard is consistenly active.  I don't see any theoretical evidence why 32 vs 64 bitness should make a difference, but the postings here suggest it does.  The bug was introduced in v4-stable with 4.6.0 (released 2010-02-24). It currently is present in all stable versions above that release (including v5). I have NOT checked development versions, as they are not suitable for production use in any case. But the bug has been introduced some time during the 4.5.x performance optimization effort.  In conclusion, I think that the actual environment and compile-time settings seem to have very important impact on the damage caused by this bug. It seems not to cause damage on the majority of platforms in use. That probably explains why it was kept undetected for so long.  As with all bugs of this kind, the fix is trivial and now attached to the tracker.  As a general advise, it is suggested to NOT accept syslog from the public Internet. If this has been forbidden, the damage potential is further restricted. If syslog must be accepted from the Internet, it is highly suggested to use RFC5424/5425 TLS-protected syslog with mutual authentication, which would prevent an attacker from injecting malicious messages.  Thanks again everyone for diagnosing this issue and working with us to fix it. At this point, I'll hand over to Andre Lorbach for coordination of the actual relases as I am heading to vacation tomorrow. If there are any further concerns, I'll try to answer them ASAP.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c22)  Rainer Gerhards    2011-08-11 11:29:16 UTC  ``` I forgot to add: the 5424 parser is NOT affected, as it uses a totally different method relying on dynamically-sized buffers (and a sufficient size of them).   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-11 12:20:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c21)) > (a) on most platforms, bufParseHOSTNAME is overrun.

At least on x86 Linux, bufParseHOSTNAME would be below bufParseTAG, which would be below i.  Hence i should be overwrite in the most common Linux builds without stack protector.  > This rearrangement happens with stack guard. Without knowing the > implementation details, it looks like stack guard seems to reorder EITHER > bufParseTAG or bufParseHOSTNAME directly after the guard variable.  Stack protector should move all non-buffer variables below buffers.  This is to reduce the likelihood that some important variable is overwritten and used before stack canary is checked.  Hence all p2parse, lenMsg, bTAGCharDetected and i should be moved below the two buffers (unless optimized out), bufParseTAG and bufParseHOSTNAME should not get reordered.  > Thus the problem is not always reproducible even if stack guard is > consistenly active.  Actually, it is reliably reproducible on at least current i686 RHEL-6 builds, leading to rsyslogd crash/abort.  > I don't see any theoretical evidence why 32 vs 64 bitness should make a > difference, but the postings here suggest it does.  I'd suspect some memory alignment may come into play, but I've not tried to confirm that.  Thank you for providing the patch!   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c24)  Rainer Gerhards    2011-08-11 12:28:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 517785](attachment.cgi?id=517785&action=diff "v5 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=517785&action=edit "v5 patch") v5 patch  Bascially same patch, but file location changed.

Of course, but I was talking about different platforms. As I said, it is (consistently) reproducible on RHEL-6 builds and F14 (I think it was). But to me it is not consitently reproducible on all platforms. Just for clarification.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=727644#c26)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-20 15:26:08 UTC  ``` When do we plan on making this public?  If we have a reproducer and a patch, should we not consider when we should be alerting other vendors and making this issue public?  What works for upstream here?  If we let vendor-sec know, they have a policy of embargoes no longer than 14 days.  Is there more to do yet, or can we plan for a release date (this also depends on upstream release schedules, etc.).

# Potential DoS with malformed TAG

  By [Adiscon Support](https://www.rsyslog.com/author/admin/)Posted on [September 1, 2011](https://www.rsyslog.com/potential-dos-with-malformed-tag/)Posted in [Security Advisories](https://www.rsyslog.com/category/security-advisories/)

***If a malformed, severely too long TAG is used in legacy (RFC3164) syslog messages, rsyslog can abort based on the conditions described in this security advisory.***

**CVE:** CVE-2011-3200

**Affected Stable Versions:**
 v4.6.0 to 4.6.7 (inclusive)
 v5.2.0 to 5.8.4 (inclusive)

Devel and Beta versions are probably also affected, but are not suitable for production and thus not analyzed in detail. Version 3 is not affeceted. Versions prior to 3 have not been analyzed.

**Fix:**
 Update to 4.6.8 or 5.8.5.  The fix is also included in the following non-beta versions: 4.7.5, 5.9.3, 6.1.12, 6.3.5.
 For non current affected versions, the following patches can most probably be applied: v4, v5. Note that due to the myriad of different versions we can not provide individual patches for all outdated versions (and in general it is less secure to run outdated versions).

**Short Description:**
 An excessively long TAG inside a legacy syslog message can lead to a two-byte stack buffer overflow. If rsyslog has been compiled with stack guard, this can lead to an abort. This has been seen on 32bit platforms, but not on 64 bit ones (though not outruled there). If not compiled with stack guard, no fatal problem occurs and the tag character is usually just truncated. Exact behaviour depends on the platform and may be slightly different on compilers different from gcc and/or non-Intel architecture machines.

**Potential Impact:** Denial of Service if triggering conditions are met. Remote code injection is not possible due to the limited size of the buffer overflow.

**Remote Exploitable:**
 Yes, if rsyslog is configured to listen to remote hosts. This is not the case by default.

**Adiscon’s severity Rating:
 Moderate**
 This is based on the fact that environment-specific non-default compile options must be selected to trigger this bug. However, stack guard is an option often activated by packages because it provides a very useful protection against attacks. So it is not unexpected that some packages contain this switch. Based on our check of some important distributions, a very small set of platforms actually was vulnerable.

If proper firewalling is applied, DoS may be triggered only from permitted hosts, e.g. as a second stage after an attack into these hosts.

An attacker may use this vulnerability to hide details of the attack (or even the fact that an attack is ongoing).

**Some general advise:**
 It is highly suggested to apply proper firewalling to the syslog machine. Also, it is suggested to protect remote access to the syslog server via TLS and mutual authentication via RFC5424/5425, especially if syslog messages need to be accepted from public or semi-public networks.

**Credits:**
 We want to thank the Red Hat secrurity team for identifying this issue and working with us in resolving it.

**Detailed Analysis:**

The problem is rooted inside the legacy syslog parser. If the TAG is larger than the defined absolute max tag size, one or two bytes above the actual tag buffer, which is kept on the stack, is overwritten with a “\0” or “:\0” respectively.  By default, this parser is called for all messages that do not have RFC5424 format. This includes local messages as well as remotely received ones. The problem is hard to reproduce on different platforms because it depends on many factors that need to go together. However, if it is reproducible, it is so always on the platform in question (so for an affected platform, the problem is always reproducible).

The problem is triggered by these variable definitions:

1193 int i; /\* general index for parsing \*/
 1194 uchar bufParseTAG[CONF\_TAG\_MAXSIZE];
 1195 uchar bufParseHOSTNAME[CONF\_HOSTNAME\_MAXSIZE];

The buffer potentially overrun is bufParseTAG. Let’s assume the compiler does not reorder variables. Then the following happens:

(a) on many platforms, variable i is partially overwritten. This index is used shortly thereafter. Truncation of TAG can happen, but no abort:
 (aa) on big endian machines, not follow-up error occurs, as the overwritten location continued 0 and the same value is written
 (ab) on little endian machines, the lowest byte is overwritten with zero,leading to a truncation of the tag value.

(b) on some platforms, bufParseHOSTNAME is overrun. This is no problem, because it is no longer used when this happens. Also bufParseTAG is strcpy()’ed right away, so this causes no issue at all.

Not all possible permutations if the compiler reorders have been analyzed (a pointless excersice). But obviously, some of the them can cause problems. The most important cases are overwriting the parse pointer or, as seen here, the return address (if bufParseTAG is located right after it).

This rearrangement happens with stack guard. Without knowing the implementation details, it looks like stack guard seems to reorder EITHER bufParseTAG or bufParseHOSTNAME directly after the guard variable. If it is bufParseTAG, the overrun will be detected and an abort happens. However, if it is bufParseHOSTNAME, the problem will neither be detected nor cause any damage (as described above). Thus the problem is not always reproducible on all platforms even if stack guard is consistenly active.

We don’t see any theoretical evidence why 32 vs 64 bitness should make a difference, but problem reports seem to indicate that an abort only happens on 32 bit platforms.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
