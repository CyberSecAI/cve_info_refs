Please do. Since they're published in the form of upstream advisories
we'd like to properly track them in the Debian Security Tracker.

This is a MSN crash. Use CVE-2011-3184

That's fine by me.  As an upstream developer I don't feel like I have
a strong incentive to obtain a CVE.  But if it's helpful to packagers,
than sure.

The two issues in question are discussed here:
<http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=54>
<http://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=55>

The second one only affects Pidgin on Microsoft Windows.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
