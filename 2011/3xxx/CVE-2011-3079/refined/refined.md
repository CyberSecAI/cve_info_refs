## Summary
The provided documents discuss CVE-2011-3079, a vulnerability stemming from improper message validation within the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) implementation of Google Chrome. This issue impacts Mozilla Firefox and other products that rely on this IPC mechanism.

## Root cause
The root cause is a lack of proper validation of messages passed through the IPC channels, potentially leading to exploitation by compromised or malicious processes. Specifically, the issue is related to how names for the IPC endpoints are generated, which may be predictable on Windows allowing untrusted processes to connect to them. 

## Weaknesses
The primary weakness is the absence of a mechanism to verify the authenticity of the communicating parties, specifically the listener. This allows for the possibility of:
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A compromised child process could connect to a parent process using predictable named pipes on Windows.
*   **Code Execution:**  Exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using IPC.
*   **Memory corruption**: Improper handling of messages in IPC can lead to memory corruption issues like use-after-free.

## Impact
Exploitation can lead to:
*   Arbitrary code execution
*   Denial of service (application crash due to memory corruption)
*   Privilege escalation from a compromised child process

## Attack vectors
*   **Network:** An attacker could exploit the vulnerability through crafted web content, especially when a browser is processing untrusted content from the network.
*   **Local:** An attacker could use a compromised process already running on a system to connect to the IPC channels of other processes.
*   **Specific to Windows**: Because IPC endpoint names are predictable on Windows the attack is easier to perform on this operating system.

## Required attacker capabilities/position
*   **Compromised process:** The attacker needs to have a compromised process already running on the user's machine to exploit the vulnerability locally.
*   **Knowledge of IPC mechanism:** An attacker would need knowledge of how the IPC works to attempt to gain access via predictable named pipes.
*   **Crafted content:** The attacker would need to be able to craft content that triggers the vulnerable code path in the browser's rendering or processing engine.

## Additional technical details
*   The vulnerability is related to the way IPC endpoint names are generated which are predictable on Windows.
*  The fix implemented for this vulnerability adds random data to the IPC channel names and limits the amount of name data passed into named pipes on Windows.
* On POSIX based systems the IPC mechanism does not use named pipes, the fix involves ensuring that an extra secret value is included in the initial messages passed through the IPC channel.

## Resolution
*   The vulnerability was addressed by updating the browsers to include random data in the IPC channel names. This ensures that an attacker cannot trivially generate the channel names needed to hijack a connection. 
* The fix also ensures that on Windows, the shared secret is not part of the named pipe name. 
* On Posix systems, an additional check is implemented such that on IPC channel establishment the client sends a secret to the server for verification

## Affected products
*   Mozilla Firefox (prior to 38.0)
*   Mozilla Firefox ESR (prior to 31.7)
*   Mozilla Thunderbird (prior to 31.7)
*   Google Chrome (prior to 18.0.1025.168)

The advisory also mentions that the older Firefox 24 ESR present on SUSE Linux Enterprise was not affected.
