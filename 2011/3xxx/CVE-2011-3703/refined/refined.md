**CVE-2011-3703 is not mentioned in the content.** However, the email thread discusses a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla!, which was assigned **CVE-2011-2488**.  This analysis will focus on the information provided about that vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a path disclosure vulnerability present in Joomla! versions prior to 1.5.23. The email mentions that "Almost all php CMS applications have this issue going on," suggesting a common coding practice or configuration issue within the PHP CMS ecosystem.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which could lead to other attacks or compromises.
- **Increased Attack Surface:**  Exposed paths can help an attacker map out the application and identify potential targets for further exploitation.
- **Loss of Confidentiality:** Sensitive information about the server setup could be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed in this email, but the general idea is that by sending specific requests to the application an attacker can reveal file paths.
- The email mentions a blog post "<http://bl0g.yehg.net/2011/04/joomla-161-and-lower-information.html>" which may provide additional details about the exact attack vector, but this link is not accessible.

-   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Joomla! instance.
-   No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The email refers to a list of affected PHP CMS applications available at a Google Code project "inspathx" link. However, that link is no longer available since Google Code Archive was closed.
- The email suggests that the problem is widespread amongst PHP CMS applications.
- The vulnerability was reported in 2010, but the CVE ID was assigned in 2011 when it went public.
