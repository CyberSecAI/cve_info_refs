How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

A remote attacker, valid Empathy user with specially-crafted nickname could send a message to particular IRC room, leading to arbitrary HTML or webscript execution, when the nickname was displayed by the theme.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=662035>  Relevant upstream patch: [2] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/empathy/commit/?id=739aca418457de752be13721218aaebc74bd9d36>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=747599#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-20 13:03:03 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the empathy package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=747599#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-20 21:27:55 UTC  ``` Created empathy tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 747737](show_bug.cgi?id=747737 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-3635 CVE-2011-4170 empathy: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c0)  Jeremy    2011-10-17 20:08:44 UTC  ``` Hello, I wrote to you to announce a bug: when a person joins a room, with the nickname "<img src="42"> onerror =" window.location = '<http://linkmauve.fr/>' "/>" for example, empathy opens the web page (here linkmauve.fr), the page of the show, which gene but users are accessing web sites sometimes unwanted. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c1)  Jeremy    2011-10-17 20:15:25 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 199265](attachment.cgi?id=199265 "screenshot of the bogue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=199265&action=edit "screenshot of the bogue") screenshot of the bogue ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c2)  Florent    2011-10-17 20:40:52 UTC  ``` This is a severe security issue, since itâs possible to execute ANY javascript (that webkit can execute) code on the remote computer, crash, data leaks, etc.  A possible fix is to just html-escape every nickname in the conversation theme.  Also note that this doesnât happen anymore on more recent empathy version since it doesnât use webkit for its theming anymore, AFAIK. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c3)  Florent    2011-10-17 21:04:10 UTC  ``` Actually, my bad, it happens with the last version. It just depends on the theme used. The default themes donât seem to be broken, but a âubuntuâ theme, provided by default in ubuntu has this issue.  It happens also with the default theme in older versions (2.x). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c4)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-18 15:22:49 UTC  ``` I didn't manage to reproduce this bug. Are you using the "Personnal Information" dialog to set your alias? What are you exactly (without any extra "") entering in the Alias entry? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c5)  Florent    2011-10-18 15:37:49 UTC  ``` You need to use the theme named âubuntuâ (maybe other non-default themes are vulnerable, IÂ do not know), it is provided by default in Ubuntu at least. You need to join a Jabber/XMPP MultiUserChat room (doesnât work on IRC due to the restrictions in the allowed chars by the IRC protocol).  Also join that same room from any other client, and with that other client, change your nick to exactly this:  <img src="42" onerror="window.location='<http://google.com>'"/>  (some client may not allow such a strange nick to be taken, but this is a perfectly legit nick on the XMPPÂ protocol). Then, with that same account, send a message on that room. This will make the nick be displayed by the theme, which will make empathy interpret the HTML, executing the Javascript code as well. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c6)  Florent    2011-10-18 15:42:02 UTC  ``` Note that this is a security issue, because the bug is triggered by any REMOTE participant in the room, letting anyone execute any Javascript code on the local empathy. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c7)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-18 16:13:36 UTC  ``` Reproduced thanks, that's indeed a very nasty bug. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c8)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-18 16:33:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 199347](attachment.cgi?id=199347 "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=199347&action=edit "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[review]](review?bug=662035&attachment=199347) theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it  Not doing so can lead to nasty HTML injection from hostile users. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c9)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-18 16:35:14 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 199348](attachment.cgi?id=199348 "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=199348&action=edit "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[review]](review?bug=662035&attachment=199348) theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it  Not doing so can lead to nasty HTML injection from hostile users. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c10)  Will Thompson    2011-10-18 16:36:13 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 199348](attachment.cgi?id=199348 "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=199348&action=edit "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[review]](review?bug=662035&attachment=199348):  Looks about right to me. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c11)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-18 16:43:44 UTC  ``` Merged to master; I'll push to 3.2 as well.

In other words, I think that name_escaped should be used instead of name in  /* If this is a /me probably */ if (action) { 	gchar *str; 		if (priv->data->version >= 4 || !priv->data->custom_template) { 		str = g_strdup_printf ("<span class='actionMessageUserName'>%s</span>" 				       "<span class='actionMessageBody'>%s</span>", 				       name, body_escaped); 	} else { 		str = g_strdup_printf ("*%s*", body_escaped); 	} 	g_free (body_escaped); 	body_escaped = str; } ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c14)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-24 08:33:55 UTC  ``` Good catch; I checked all the calls to theme_adium_append_html() but didn't realise /me was using another code path.  Fixed in master and 3.2. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c15)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-24 08:34:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 199797](attachment.cgi?id=199797 "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=199797&action=edit "theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it") [[review]](review?bug=662035&attachment=199797) theme_adium_append_message: escape alias before displaying it  Not doing so can lead to nasty HTML injection from hostile users. ``` [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=662035#c16)  Guillaume Desmottes    2011-10-24 08:35:38 UTC  ``` ^ Here is the full patch for patching purposes. ``` |  |
