- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rcID` parameter in Concrete CMS versions 5.4.1.1 and earlier is not properly sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary script code into a victim's browser through a specially crafted URL, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the `rcID` parameter and tricks a user into accessing it. The provided proof-of-concept utilizes an HTML form with the vulnerable parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs, and the victim needs to be logged in or perform an action that makes the vulnerable code be executed in their browser.
