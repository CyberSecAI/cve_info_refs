Package: polipo
Severity: important
Tags: security

Hi,

A denial of service attack has been published against polipo:
<http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Oct/10>

Given that polipo is intended for a limited audience, the attack needs to
originate from this audience and the result is a denial of service, I
think this doesn't need a full blown DSA. It should be fixed in unstable
though, and possibly through (old)stable-proposed-updates.

Please mention [CVE-2011-3596](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3596) in your changelog entries.

thanks,
Thijs

```

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=742891#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-03 09:53:28 UTC  ``` A denial of service flaw was found in the way Polipo, a lightweight caching web proxy, processed certain HTTP POST / PUT requests. If polipo was configured to allow remote client connections and particular host was allowed to connect to polipo server instance, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service (polipo daemon abort due to assertion failure) via specially-crafted HTTP POST / PUT request.

It should fix CVE-2011-3596, from CHANGES file:    * Fail expectations on the local interface.  This might or might not be     what CVE-2011-3596 is about, difficult to say since nobody is speaking     to me.  So upstream is not 100% sure, but at least exploit from [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=385307#c1) doesn't work anymore: polipo bails out with "405 Method not allowed".  Please not that 1.1.1 also fixes CVE-2009-3305:    * Fixed a crash that occurs when a server sends a malformed     Cache-Control: header (CVE-2009-3305). Thanks to Stefan Fritsch.  Vulnerable unstable version is removed. So what is left to stabilize polipo-1.1.1 and remove old stable. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Justin Lecher (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2015-01-09 08:05:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to Andrew Savchenko from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=385307#c1)) > Vulnerable unstable version is removed. So what is left to stabilize > polipo-1.1.1 and remove old stable.  Please add arches in CC and tell them with version to stabilize. Also change the title of the bug to reflect which versions are affected. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Andrew Savchenko   gentoo-dev  2015-01-09 14:05:47 UTC  ``` Arch teams, please stabilize =net-proxy/polipo-1.1.1. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Andreas Schürch   gentoo-dev  2015-01-11 14:13:10 UTC  ``` x86 done. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2015-01-12 10:38:13 UTC  ``` amd64 stable.  Maintainer(s), please cleanup. Security, please vote. ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Andrew Savchenko   gentoo-dev  2015-01-12 16:17:33 UTC  ``` All vulnerable versions are removed from tree. ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Kristian Fiskerstrand (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2015-10-31 16:25:44 UTC  ``` GLSA Vote: No ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Stefan Behte (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2015-11-09 22:05:20 UTC  ``` Vote: NO. ``` |  |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage
