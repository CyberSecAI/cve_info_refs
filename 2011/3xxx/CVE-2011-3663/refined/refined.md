Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) animation elements, specifically `<set>` and `<animate>` with the `accessKey` attribute, to trigger actions and potentially transmit data even when JavaScript is disabled. This occurs because the `accessKey` event listener was not properly restricted, allowing it to respond to keystrokes at the document level, not just within the SVG element itself.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted `accessKey` event handling:** SVG animation elements could use `accessKey` to trigger events and actions even when Javascript was disabled, allowing for keylogging.
*   **Bypass of Scripting Restrictions:** This vulnerability allowed malicious actors to execute code with limited functionality similar to javascript even with scripting disabled through browser settings or extensions like NoScript.
*   **Potential for Phishing:** It was possible to create a fake password dialog in a saved mail file, which would appear to prompt for a password and use the accessKey to send the captured data to a remote server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Keystroke Logging:** Attackers could potentially record user keystrokes, including sensitive data like passwords or other private information by using a combination of iframes and autofocus features.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Keystrokes could be sent to an arbitrary domain, violating the Same Origin Policy.
*   **Phishing and Spoofing:** Attackers could create fake dialogs or prompts, especially within email clients, tricking users into entering sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** By injecting SVG code into websites an attacker could potentially record user keystrokes even when Javascript was disabled.
*   **Compromised Ad Banners:** A compromised ad server could inject malicious SVG code into banners displayed on websites.
*   **HTML Emails:** Attackers could craft malicious HTML emails with SVG animation to capture user inputs.
*   **IFrames:** A malicious site could use an IFrame to load and control the content of a benign site, potentially intercepting user input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Code Injection:** Attackers need to be able to inject SVG code into the target's browser environment.
*   **Social Engineering:** For phishing attacks, attackers would need to convince users to enable remote content in emails or enter information into fake prompts.
*   **Knowledge of Target:** For the phishing attacks to work best, it would be ideal for the attacker to know what client and OS the victim was using.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was more severe when used in conjunction with the capability of loading external resources, such as images. By linking to an external resource, the attacker could send keystrokes to a remote server.
*   The impact was particularly notable for users who explicitly disable JavaScript with the intent of enhanced security, as this SVG-based keylogging circumvents such measures.
*   The fix involved disabling event-triggered SMIL animations when scripting was disabled except for whitelisted events such as "beginEvent", "endEvent", and "repeatEvent".
*   The vulnerability was present in Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird.
