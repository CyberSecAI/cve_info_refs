| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c0)  kingcope    2011-08-24 00:49:57 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 27429](attachment.cgi?id=27429 "DoS Exploit for mentioned vulnerability") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=27429&action=edit "DoS Exploit for mentioned vulnerability") DoS Exploit for mentioned vulnerability  At least apache 2.2.17 has a remotely exploitable dos vulnerability which allows to consume all memory on a target system. A request for triggering the memory consumption includes a large "Range" header which requests as many different bytes as possible from a file served by httpd. Combining this with a gzip "Accept-Encoding" header the httpd is assumed to compress each of the bytes requested in the Range header seperately consuming large memory regions. The behaviour when compressing the streams is devestating and can end up in rendering the underlying operating system unusable when the requests are sent parallely. Symptomps are swapping to disk and killing of processes including but not solely httpd processes.  How to repeat: Execute the attached perl script for a vulnerable httpd, means Byte Range filter and mod_deflate/mod_gzip enabled.  Sidenote: Apache should be aware of that through posting to full disclosure. Nevertheless should in my opinion this bug be resolved. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c1)  kingcope    2011-08-24 03:32:01 UTC  ``` As discussed on the Apache Dev Mailing list it looks like this issue has nothing to do with mod_deflate or mod_gzip, wrong assumption by me.  (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c0)) > Created [attachment 27429](attachment.cgi?id=27429 "DoS Exploit for mentioned vulnerability") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=27429&action=edit "DoS Exploit for mentioned vulnerability") > DoS Exploit for mentioned vulnerability >  > At least apache 2.2.17 has a remotely exploitable dos vulnerability which > allows to consume all memory on a target system.

A small addition might be in place to the work-around option suggested in:  <<http://marc.info/?l=apache-httpd-dev&m=131418828705324&w=2>>  The first mitigation option was a configuration change:  RequestHeader unset Range  In addition to dropping the "Range" from request headers, it might prove useful to drop the "If-Range" as well, and might also be polite to respond with "Accept-Ranges: none". This could be accomplished with:  # Removes the "Range" and "If-Range" from the request headers RequestHeader unset Range RequestHeader unset If-Range # Removes all "Accept-Ranges" from the response headers Header unset Accept-Ranges # Sets "Accept-Ranges: none" to the response headers Header set Accept-Ranges none  (I'm not sure if the "Header unset Accept-Ranges" is even necessary.)  According to the HTTP 1.1 specification RFC 2616:  * "Servers that do not accept any kind of range request for a resource MAY send 'Accept-Ranges: none'" (section 14.5); and * "A server MAY ignore the Range header" (section 14.35.2).  But clearly this is only a work-around. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c3)  Eric Covener    2011-09-03 17:58:08 UTC  ``` released in 2.2.20, just needs a 2.0 release to close I guess. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c4)  akuster    2011-09-13 17:24:15 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c3)) > released in 2.2.20, just needs a 2.0 release to close I guess.  any news on a 2.0.x fix ? ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=51714#c5)  Eric Covener    2014-03-20 15:21:26 UTC  ``` revert OS change. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Furthermore various vendor updates, improved regexes (speed and   accommodating a different and new attack pattern).  Note that previously published mitigations 1) and 3) were incomplete and failed to block attack using Request-Range header, which is treated as equivalent to Range header.  All previously deployed mitigations 1) and 3) need to be updated!  Upstream now also lists 1) Option 1 as being applicable to 2.2 versions only due to the bug in 2.0 versions.  That workaround can not be used with httpd packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, as was previously noted in [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c5).   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-26 20:30:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c18)) > Upstream has released updated advisory: >  > <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-August/082427.html>  Additional notes regarding mitigation 1, Option 2:  - Mitigation always unsets Request-Range header.  Additionally, a commented-out example is provided how Request-Range can be handled in a similar way as Range header and only reject request if too many ranges are specified:      RewriteCond %{[HTTP:range](http:///range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)     # RewriteCond %{[HTTP:request-range](http:///request-range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(?:,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)  If the second RewriteCond is uncommented, the condition will be ANDed with previous, while is should be ORed.  That can be achieved by using [OR] flag for the first RewriteCond:      RewriteCond %{[HTTP:range](http:///range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$) [OR]  - Rewrite rules specified in the server context are not automatically inherited by virtual hosts.  Therefore, this mitigation need to be duplicated in each virtual host, or each virtual host need to be explicitly configured to inherit server context rewrite rules.  See mod_rewrite documentation for details:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#vhosts>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c20)  Mark J. Cox    2011-08-29 15:24:16 UTC  ``` Status update: Upstream are currently working on the security patch for this issue for Apache 2.2 and are expected to release 2.2.20 in due course.  Meanwhile we've been backporting and testing the preliminary patches so that we can rapidly prepare updates for the affected products once a final patch is agreed.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c21)  Ray Van Dolson    2011-08-29 15:36:39 UTC  ``` Is an updated RHWAS Apache release planned as well, or just the base OS Apaches?   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-30 07:01:48 UTC  ``` Patch in the upstream SVN 2.2.x branch:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/modules/http/byterange_filter.c?r1=916627&r2=1162885>  which consists of:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1162874> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1162881> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1162885>  Summary of the changes from the CHANGES file:    *) SECURITY: [CVE-2011-3192](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3192) (cve.mitre.org)      core: Fix handling of byte-range requests to use less memory, to avoid      denial of service.

If more than 5 ranges are specified, Range header is ignored/unset, which causes httpd to respond with "200 OK" and return the whole requested file rather than only returning specified ranges.  Request-Range header is always unset, causing the whole file to be returned when client tries to use that header.  1.2 RewriteEngine on     RewriteCond %{[HTTP:range](http:///range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)     RewriteRule .* - [F]     RequestHeader unset Request-Range  Requests with 5 or fewer ranges specified using Range header are processed as before - i.e. httpd responds with "206 Partial Content" and provides only specified file ranges when possible.  If more than 5 ranges are specified, httpd responds with "403 Forbidden".  Request-Range header is always unset, causing the whole file to be returned when client tries to use that header (unless user of Range header makes httpd reject the request).  2   LimitRequestFieldSize 200  Requests with all headers with length up to 200 bytes are processed as before - i.e. httpd responds with "206 Partial Content" and provides only specified file ranges when possible.  If any header is longer than specified limit (it does not have to be Range or Request-Range, e.g. Cookie headers are known to often require more than 200 bytes), httpd rejects request with "400 Bad Request".  3   RequestHeader unset Range      RequestHeader unset Request-Range  Header Range and Request-Range are always ignored/unset, httpd always responds with "200 OK" and returns the whole requested file rather than only returning specified ranges.  With this workaround, clients are no longer able to continue / resume interrupted downloads (e.g. wget -c).   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c26)  xset1980    2011-08-30 22:28:58 UTC  ``` People, Debian has already fixed the problem in all its branches, which runs redhat not yet?.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Also following bugs were fixed:
\* recommend the default MPM (prefork) via Recommends:
in .spec

enabled.
\* take LimitRequestFieldsize config option into account
when parsing headers from backend.

work arounds be considered from the Apache Software Foundation.

1) Use SetEnvIf or mod_rewrite to detect a large number of ranges and then either \
ignore the Range: header or reject the request.

2) Limit the size of the request field to a few hundred bytes.

3) Use mod_headers to completely disallow the use of Range headers.

Please refer to the Apache advisory for details. \

This script creates a number of threads that use multiple Range headers to exhaust memory on the Apache server.  The ASF httpd development team are working on a fix for this issue: <http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/apache/dev/401638>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-24 14:01:27 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c0)) > An exploit was posted to full-disclosure labelled "Apache Killer".  This script > creates a number of threads that use multiple Range headers to exhaust memory > on the Apache server.  <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-August/082299.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-24 16:39:18 UTC  ``` Upstream has released an advisory, which documents possible configuration changes that can be used to mitigate this flaw before the final fix is available:  [http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201108.mbox/%3C20110824161640.122D387DD@minotaur.apache.org%3E](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201108.mbox/%3C20110824161640.122D387DD%40minotaur.apache.org%3E)  Note: the mitigation 1, option 1 (using SetEnvIf and conditional RequestHeader unset) can not be used with httpd packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 (based on httpd 2.0.x upstream versions) that do no allow env clauses with RequestHeader unset.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-25 07:43:27 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 733217](show_bug.cgi?id=733217 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3192 httpd: multiple ranges DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-25 09:00:13 UTC  ``` Statement:  Before updated packages are deployed, users can deploy configuration changes to mitigate this flaw: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3192#c18>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-26 10:54:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c5)) > Upstream has released an advisory, which documents possible configuration > changes that can be used to mitigate this flaw before the final fix is > available: >  > [http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201108.mbox/%3C20110824161640.122D387DD@minotaur.apache.org%3E](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-announce/201108.mbox/%3C20110824161640.122D387DD%40minotaur.apache.org%3E)  Upstream has released updated advisory:  <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-August/082427.html>  Following paragraph of the updated advisory describes changes from the previous version:    In addition to the 'Range' header - the 'Range-Request' header is equally   affected. Furthermore various vendor updates, improved regexes (speed and   accommodating a different and new attack pattern).  Note that previously published mitigations 1) and 3) were incomplete and failed to block attack using Request-Range header, which is treated as equivalent to Range header.  All previously deployed mitigations 1) and 3) need to be updated!  Upstream now also lists 1) Option 1 as being applicable to 2.2 versions only due to the bug in 2.0 versions.  That workaround can not be used with httpd packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4, as was previously noted in [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c5).   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c19)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-26 20:30:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c18)) > Upstream has released updated advisory: >  > <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-August/082427.html>  Additional notes regarding mitigation 1, Option 2:  - Mitigation always unsets Request-Range header.  Additionally, a commented-out example is provided how Request-Range can be handled in a similar way as Range header and only reject request if too many ranges are specified:      RewriteCond %{[HTTP:range](http:///range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)     # RewriteCond %{[HTTP:request-range](http:///request-range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(?:,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)  If the second RewriteCond is uncommented, the condition will be ANDed with previous, while is should be ORed.  That can be achieved by using [OR] flag for the first RewriteCond:      RewriteCond %{[HTTP:range](http:///range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$) [OR]  - Rewrite rules specified in the server context are not automatically inherited by virtual hosts.  Therefore, this mitigation need to be duplicated in each virtual host, or each virtual host need to be explicitly configured to inherit server context rewrite rules.  See mod_rewrite documentation for details:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html#vhosts>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c20)  Mark J. Cox    2011-08-29 15:24:16 UTC  ``` Status update: Upstream are currently working on the security patch for this issue for Apache 2.2 and are expected to release 2.2.20 in due course.  Meanwhile we've been backporting and testing the preliminary patches so that we can rapidly prepare updates for the affected products once a final patch is agreed.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c21)  Ray Van Dolson    2011-08-29 15:36:39 UTC  ``` Is an updated RHWAS Apache release planned as well, or just the base OS Apaches?   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-30 07:01:48 UTC  ``` Patch in the upstream SVN 2.2.x branch:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/httpd/httpd/branches/2.2.x/modules/http/byterange_filter.c?r1=916627&r2=1162885>  which consists of:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1162874> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1162881> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1162885>  Summary of the changes from the CHANGES file:    *) SECURITY: [CVE-2011-3192](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3192) (cve.mitre.org)      core: Fix handling of byte-range requests to use less memory, to avoid      denial of service.

If more than 5 ranges are specified, Range header is ignored/unset, which causes httpd to respond with "200 OK" and return the whole requested file rather than only returning specified ranges.  Request-Range header is always unset, causing the whole file to be returned when client tries to use that header.  1.2 RewriteEngine on     RewriteCond %{[HTTP:range](http:///range)} !(bytes=[^,]+(,[^,]+){0,4}$|^$)     RewriteRule .* - [F]     RequestHeader unset Request-Range  Requests with 5 or fewer ranges specified using Range header are processed as before - i.e. httpd responds with "206 Partial Content" and provides only specified file ranges when possible.  If more than 5 ranges are specified, httpd responds with "403 Forbidden".  Request-Range header is always unset, causing the whole file to be returned when client tries to use that header (unless user of Range header makes httpd reject the request).  2   LimitRequestFieldSize 200  Requests with all headers with length up to 200 bytes are processed as before - i.e. httpd responds with "206 Partial Content" and provides only specified file ranges when possible.  If any header is longer than specified limit (it does not have to be Range or Request-Range, e.g. Cookie headers are known to often require more than 200 bytes), httpd rejects request with "400 Bad Request".  3   RequestHeader unset Range      RequestHeader unset Request-Range  Header Range and Request-Range are always ignored/unset, httpd always responds with "200 OK" and returns the whole requested file rather than only returning specified ranges.  With this workaround, clients are no longer able to continue / resume interrupted downloads (e.g. wget -c).   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=732928#c26)  xset1980    2011-08-30 22:28:58 UTC  ``` People, Debian has already fixed the problem in all its branches, which runs redhat not yet?.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Apache 2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2011:1216-1
Rating: important
References: #555098 #627030 #661597 #663359 #690734 #713966
Cross-References: CVE-2011-3192
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP2
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves one vulnerability and has 5 fixes is
now available.
Description:
This update fixes a remote denial of service bug (memory
exhaustion) in the Apache 2 HTTP server, that could be
triggered by remote attackers using multiple overlapping
Request Ranges . (CVE-2011-3192)
The fix introduces a new config option: Allow MaxRanges
Number of ranges requested, if exceeded, the complete
content is served. default: 200 0|unlimited: unlimited
none: Range headers are ignored. (This option is a backport
from 2.2.21.)
It fixes also the minor security issue in the mod\_cache
modules in the Apache HTTP Server that allowed remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via
a request that lacks a path. (CVE-2010-1452)
It also fixes some non-security bugs: - take
LimitRequestFieldsize config option into account when
parsing headers from backend. Thereby avoid that the
receiving buffers are too small. bnc#690734. - add / when
on a directory to feed correctly linked listings.
bnc#661597 - a2enmod shalt not disable a module in query
mode. bnc#663359 - New option SSLRenegBufferSize fixes
"413 Request Entity Too Large occur" problem. - fixes
graceful restart hangs, bnc#555098.
