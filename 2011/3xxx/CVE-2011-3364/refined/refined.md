{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `svEscape` function in `shvar.c` did not properly escape newline characters when writing connection names to ifcfg files, allowing for command injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Command injection vulnerability",
       "Insufficient escaping of special characters"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation to root.",
    "attack_vectors": "A local, unprivileged user can create or modify network connection names via NetworkManager, injecting newline characters and shell commands within the connection's name. When the connection is activated, these commands are executed with root privileges.",
    "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged console user needs the ability to create or modify network connections via NetworkManager. This capability might be granted via PolicyKit, although the default policy settings may prevent this."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "affected_components": "NetworkManager ifcfg-rh plugin",
    "affected_versions": "NetworkManager versions in Fedora 14, 15 and potentially RHEL 6 configurations",
    "fixed_in_versions": "Patches were created for NM 0.8.x (RHEL 6 and Fedora 14) and NM 0.9.x (Fedora 15 and above). The fix involves removing newline characters when writing to the ifcfg file.",
   "discovery": "Discovered by Matt McCutchen and responsibly reported."
