| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c0)  Matt McCutchen    2011-09-11 08:13:02 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Between F14 and F15, NetworkManager was changed so that unprivileged console users can store both personal and system connections via the ifcfg-rh plugin.  As a result, [bug 682290](show_bug.cgi?id=682290 "CLOSED WONTFIX - ifcfg plugin can write connection name containing newlines, corrupting file") now constitutes a vulnerability allowing such users to escalate to root.  To avoid calling attention to this, I am filing a separate bug rather than updating [bug 682290](show_bug.cgi?id=682290 "CLOSED WONTFIX - ifcfg plugin can write connection name containing newlines, corrupting file").  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): NetworkManager-0.9.0-1.fc15  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce (as an unprivileged console user): 1. Create a wired connection named `test'. 2. Change the name to `test\nUSERCTL=true\n/bin/bash', where `\n' stands for a newline entered via Ctrl-Shift-U, A. 3. usernetctl test up  Actual results: Root shell.  Expected results: Format integrity of /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-test is maintained.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c2)  Jirka Klimes    2011-09-14 15:51:48 UTC  ``` Connection ID's are basically not restricted and they can contain virtually any character (including non-printable, control, etc.). That's not problem per se. However, when the ID is used is some places some characters can cause problems.  In this case, when NAME variable (connection's ID) is written to ifcfg file, some characters are escaped with \ in shvar.c (escapees[] = "\"'\\$~`"). This prevents undesired behaviour in shell, because ifcfg files can be shell-interpreted by means of initscripts.  a) The easiest solution would be just dropping newline characters when writing to ifcfg file. See attached patch doing that.  b) If we wanted to preserve the newline characters (and/or other control characters), we have to change svEscape()/svUnescape() to proper transfer  LF <-> "\n", CR <-> "\r", etc. But, I think non-pritable characters in connection names don't bring any user value and "\n" may cause some problems too in ifcfg files.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c3)  Jirka Klimes    2011-09-14 15:53:04 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 523188](attachment.cgi?id=523188&action=diff "Removing newline characters while writing to ifcfg file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=523188&action=edit "Removing newline characters while writing to ifcfg file") Removing newline characters while writing to ifcfg file   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c4)  Jirka Klimes    2011-09-14 16:11:47 UTC  ``` One suggestion: I've noticed that shvar.[h|c] used in NM for handling ifcfg files are used by some other packages: usermode, initscripts. And maybe others. It looks like the code comes from ancient rp3 (RedHat PPP dialer).  It would be useful to separate the code to an independent library, so that everyone could use it and don't have to duplicate the code. Or at least put the code to a repository as source routines (like gnulib), so that changes are done in one place and everybody can get the latest version from it (maybe mark initscripts copy as that).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c5)  Bill Nottingham    2011-09-14 17:49:11 UTC  ``` It's historically a copy-paste library, mostly due to laziness.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c6)  Dan Williams    2011-09-14 19:41:41 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c3)) > Created [attachment 523188](attachment.cgi?id=523188&action=diff "Removing newline characters while writing to ifcfg file") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=523188&action=edit "Removing newline characters while writing to ifcfg file") > Removing newline characters while writing to ifcfg file  Looks good, lets push this into RHEL packages for the security update Z stream.  After the embargo lifts we can push upstream and to Fedora.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c7)  Matt McCutchen    2011-09-15 03:21:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c6)) > Looks good, lets push this into RHEL packages for the security update Z stream. >  After the embargo lifts we can push upstream and to Fedora.  And let the Fedora systems get hacked?  Thanks a lot.  That will make me give you private notice of issues in the future.  I thought RHEL is listed as "notaffected" anyway?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c8)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-16 12:21:24 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-3364](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3364) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c9)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-16 13:04:38 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c7))  Hello Matt,    thank you for responsibly reporting this issue to us.    To be able to move with this one towards its correction and public announcement we would need privately (in encrypted way) to contact and inform other Linux distributions, shipping NetworkManager package too, about presence of this flaw.    Though it is not likely other distributions would use the ifcfg-rh plug-in, which is required this issue to be exploitable. But it is likely, their NetworkManager versions might be affected by improper escaping of certain characters too. Thus we would like to ask you for an approval to privately (in encrypted way) inform other distributions about presence of this issue. Please let us know, if we can do this.    Due the embargo date -- we have preliminary set it up to next Wednesday, 2011-09-21. If there would be no embargo date changes necessary (due various reasons, since this depends on many conditions), on next Wednesday this bug would be opened for public audience and affected Fedora NetworManager package updates scheduled.    Should there be embargo date change required yet, we would inform you again via this bug.

Matt, just clear up some confusion - Fedora has its dist-git and koji public, there's no mechanism to do private commits / builds.

## [BSidesBUD 2023: A Deeper Look at the Disrupted Bot Farms in Ukraine](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/02/bsidesbud-2023-a-deeper-look-at-the-disrupted-bot-farms-in-ukraine/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/02/bsidesbud-2023-a-deeper-look-at-the-disrupted-bot-farms-in-ukraine/#respond)

It would probably take us many years to look into all the intricate details of the countless cyber operations that are taking place globally in relation to the Ukraine/Russia conflict the last couple of years. As a tiny step towards that direction, in 2023 I did some research on how Russian intelligence services have been setting up and utilising “bot farms” inside Ukraine.

Eventually, I was accepted to present this research at BSidesBUD 2023. A really nice event at the capital of Hungary that I’d definitely recommend to everyone from our industry.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bsidesbud_2023.jpg?w=1024)

In case you want to get an idea of the content, below I’m attaching the slides that I used. However, the slides were mostly to support my presentation so they do not have that much value on their own. Nevertheless, it was a subject that I hadn’t come across in any security conference before, so I thought it’s worth documenting for future reference.

## [Kaspersky SAS ’23](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/kaspersky-sas-23/#respond)

I’m always seeking to learn and experience different cyber security events since each one of them gives you a different perspective of our industry (and the world), and Kaspersky’s Security Analyst Summit (SAS), was in my “*to do*” list for a long time.

I planned to attend SAS in 2018-2019 but due to some competing priorities, I couldn’t. Then, in 2020 I applied to do a presentation titled “cyber-crime ecosystem in the travel industry” which was accepted, but the conference was cancelled due to the pandemic, and in 2023 it was the first time since the pandemic that SAS was back. So, after 5 years, I finally managed to attend the SAS ’23 which took place in Phuket, Thailand and was a wonderful, small, security conference.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-1.png?w=1024)

It was a relatively small event with a couple of hundred of people or so. But the content was incredible. From all sorts of APTs that you rarely hear about, to innovative research, and of course having the ability network and chat with professionals from national CERTs as well as security researchers from countries rarely present in the well-known US and European cyber security events, with a truly amazing organisation, lots of activities and surprises.

As security professionals it’s imperative that we understand the threat landscape globally, and this event was a remarkable place to gain that insight for anyone coming from US or EU background. Both from the defenders and the attackers’ perspective, the event included very interesting TTPs and content that I hadn’t seen before.

Lastly, as Eugene Kaspersky put it in one of the conference activities, a great security conference needs to have: 1) new and innovative security research/content; 2) be hosted in a nice environment/location that allows people to disconnect from their day-to-day work; and 3) be fun. SAS ’23 managed to cover all three areas successfully.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/sas23.jpg?w=1024)

It’s hard to choose my favourite talks from this event, but if I had to pick 5 (in no particular order), based on the knowledge I acquired from them, those would be:

* **StripedFly: Traversing the Blue Expanse in Search of Eternal Wonders**
  + by Sergey Belov and Sergey Lozhkin (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **How Many Gates to the Temple of Space? Shapes of Tunnels Drilled by Desecrators**
  + by Askar Dyussekeyev (KZ-CERT)
* **Unearthing TetrisPhantom: Discovering secrets of an intricate cyber threat campaign**
  + by Noushin Shabab (Kaspersky GReAT)
* **Operation Triangulation: Сonnecting the Dots**
  + by Igor Kuznetsov (Kaspersky)
* **Space Pirates: raiders of privacy**
  + by Denis Kuvshinov (Positive Technologies)

## [2022 CTI-EU Talk: Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2023/01/01/2022-cti-eu-talk-threat-landscape-and-defences-against-mobile-surveillance-implants/#respond)

In December 2022 I had a very pleasant surprise, I was given an opportunity to give a lightning talk at the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) conference of 2022, known as **CTI-EU 2022**. I had attended previous editions of this event and it was an amazing experience, so having that opportunity was a great honour.

I had a few different topics that I was researching around that time and after a small discussion with the organisers we agreed that the best option would be the “Threat Landscape and Defences Against Mobile Surveillance Implants”.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image.png?w=800)

If you’d like to see what other presentations took place during the CTI-EU 2022, check out the [published agenda](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/events/2022-cti-eu-conference-1/enisa-cti-eu-conference-agenda.pdf) for the event. There were some very valuable presentations, but of course, being an on-site event, the most important part was the face-to-face interactions. With this event ENISA manages to bring public and private sector CTI experts together and we had numerous fruitful conversations ranging from CTI topics, to public/private sector collaborations, challenges, and more.

I’m not sure if/when ENISA will publish the slides from the TLP:WHITE talks, but if you’d like to see mine you can get them here. Apparently, being a lightning talk I couldn’t go in-depth in almost anything, but if you are interested in something mentioned in my slides (but with more depth), please contact me. Additionally, if you are researching this space and would like a second pair of eyes, I’d be more than happy to help.

## [OSINT: A Summary of SIDEWINDER Operations in 2022](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/23/osint-a-summary-of-sidewinder-operations-in-2022/#respond)

SIDEWINDER (also known as RAZOR TIGER, RATTLESNAKE, T-APT-04, HARDCORE NATIONALIST, and APT-C-17) is a cyber espionage actor who has been active at least since 2012. I had a look on all the publicly known 2022 operations (that I could find) attributed to this actor to derive some insights and here’s the outcome.

The main outcome we can derive is that SIDEWINDER is focusing mainly on Pakistani military targets (particularly the Navy) to conduct cyber espionage.

In terms of the data I used, through publicly available information I found 40 unique events (let’s call them operations) for the period of January 2022-December 2022 and here are some statistics…

**Note**: Apparently this is a tiny number compared to [Kaspersky’s](https://thehackernews.com/2022/05/sidewinder-hackers-launched-over-1000.html) “*over 1,000 new attacks since April 2020*” but I tried to keep it limited to 2022, publicly available reports, and only those that had some context. Not just IOCs.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_target_countries.jpg?w=851)

*Figure 1: Countries targeted by SIDEWINDER*

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_targeted_sectors.jpg?w=769)

*Figure 2: Sectors targeted by SIDEWINDER*

Many identify SIDEWINDER as an Indian cyber espionage actor and based on the targets of *Figure 1* and *Figure 2* I’d say that we can safely assume that their main target is Pakistani military entities which makes this actor better aligned with what a military intelligence agency would be performing. Maybe something like India’s [Directorate of Military Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directorate_of_Military_Intelligence_%28India%29)? Apparently, there are no hard evidence here to be certain about this, just some food for thought.

Considering the main target is the Pakistani military, here’s a breakdown of the specific SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan from the limited 2022 dataset I mentioned in the introduction.

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sidewinder_breakdown_of_pakistani_targets.jpg?w=976)

*Figure 3: Volumetric analysis of top SIDEWINDER targets in Pakistan*

Based on that limited dataset, clearly the Pakistani Navy was by far the top target of SIDEWINDER for 2022, strengthening the hypothesis of SIDEWINDER being an actor associated with India’s military intelligence, or even naval intelligence.

With such small sample sets, timelines aren’t particularly valuable but I know that people will be asking for it so here is a timeline analysis too.

## [BSides Cyprus: Cloud… Just somebody else’s computer](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/)

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2022/12/22/bsides-cyprus-cloud-just-somebody-elses-computer/#respond)

Just noticed that I haven’t published much for the last few talks I’ve been giving and this is one of them…

That was my 8th, and last, talk for 2021. It was a research more on the cloud security architect/engineering side. That was my second time participating in [BSides Cyprus](https://twitter.com/BsidesCyprus), and as always, it was an amazing event with amazing people. The organizers of BSides Cyprus did a remarkable job. From the set up of the remote event, to the CTF, the prizes for the CTF participants, and the overall atmosphere, it was an excellent event.

Now specifically on my talk, that was a subject that I was preparing for around a year and I’m glad I got to talk about it in BSides Cyprus. For various reasons, public cloud providers are intentionally abstracting lots of the plumbing on how everything is put together and how does this affect security.

So, in this talk I picked up a few services from AWS, GCP, and Azure and dissected them to demonstrate that:

* It’s just computers and software under the hood
* How having this “inner” architectural understanding helps you uncover vulnerabilities (using some publicly available ones in the examples, no 0days or embargoed issues revealed)

![](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bsidescyprus21.jpg?w=1024)

My goal with this talk wasn’t to uncover some significant design flaw or claim that public cloud is bad. Just to raise awareness and change the mindset of security engineers when working with public cloud to think beyond what the vendor’s documentation says. If you’d like to have a look, you can find my [slides here](https://xorl.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/cloud...-just-somebody-elses-computer.pdf).

## CVE-2011-3364: GNOME NetworkManager Local Privilege Escalation

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/cve-2011-3364-gnome-networkmanager-local-privilege-escalation/#respond)

This is was a nice design flaw that could lead to local privilege escalation. However this is not such a high impact issue since it requires unprivileged local users having access to create new network connections in PolicyKit which is disabled by default.

As we can see [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=737338), this was reported by Matt McCutchen and we can find the buggy code in src/settings/plugins/ifcfg-rh/shvar.c source code file which is shown below.

```

/* create a new string with all necessary characters escaped.
 * caller must free returned string
 */
static const char escapees[] = "\"'\\$~`";              /* must be escaped */
static const char spaces[] = " \t|&;()<>";              /* only require "" */
char *
svEscape(const char *s) {
    char *new;
    int i, j, mangle = 0, space = 0;
    int newlen, slen;
    static int esclen, splen;

    if (!esclen) esclen = strlen(escapees);
    if (!splen) splen = strlen(spaces);
    slen = strlen(s);

    for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
        if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) mangle++;
        if (strchr(spaces, s[i])) space++;
    }
    if (!mangle && !space) return strdup(s);

    newlen = slen + mangle + 3; /* 3 is extra ""\0 */
    new = g_malloc0(newlen);
    if (!new) return NULL;

    j = 0;
    new[j++] = '"';
    for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
        if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) {
            new[j++] = '\\';
        }
        new[j++] = s[i];
    }
    new[j++] = '"';
    g_assert(j == slen + mangle + 2); /* j is the index of the '\0' */

    return new;
}

```

The above C routine is used to escape some characters. So, although it does check for some characters, more specifically the following:

```

- "
- '
- \
- $
- ~
- `
- \t
- |
- &
- ;
- (
- )
- <
- >

```

It does not check for new line character at all. Because of this, as Matt McCutchen mentioned, a user could create a new wired connection with a name of for example “name” and then rename it to something similar to:

```

'test\nUSERCTL=true\n/bin/bash'

```

Where newline entered via Ctrl-Shift-U, A (as we can read [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c0)). Now, if the following command is executed, it will spawn a root shell.

```

usernetctl test up

```

To fix this, another array was added in the shvar.c file which contains the newline sequence of characters.

```

 static const char escapees[] = "\"'\\$~`";		/* must be escaped */
 static const char spaces[] = " \t|&;()<>";		/* only require "" */
+static const char newlines[] = "\n\r";			/* only require "" */

```

Next, a new variable to count the newlines was added in svEscape() routine as you can see here:

```

 char *
 svEscape(const char *s) {
     char *new;
-    int i, j, mangle = 0, space = 0;
+    int i, j, mangle = 0, space = 0, newline = 0;
     int newlen, slen;
     static int esclen, splen;

```

And finally, the additional newlines checks were placed in the aforementioned function.

```

     for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
 	if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) mangle++;
 	if (strchr(spaces, s[i])) space++;
+	if (strchr(newlines, s[i])) newline++;
     }
-    if (!mangle && !space) return strdup(s);
+    if (!mangle && !space && !newline) return strdup(s);

-    newlen = slen + mangle + 3;	/* 3 is extra ""\0 */
+    newlen = slen + mangle - newline + 3;	/* 3 is extra ""\0 */
     new = g_malloc0(newlen);
     if (!new) return NULL;

     j = 0;
     new[j++] = '"';
     for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
+	if (strchr(newlines, s[i]))
+	    continue;
 	if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) {
 	    new[j++] = '\\';
 	}
 	new[j++] = s[i];
     }
     new[j++] = '"';
-    g_assert(j == slen + mangle + 2); /* j is the index of the '\0' */
+    g_assert(j == slen + mangle - newline + 2); /* j is the index of the '\0' */

```

## CVE-2011-3364: GNOME NetworkManager Local Privilege Escalation

[leave a comment »](https://xorl.wordpress.com/2011/10/09/cve-2011-3364-gnome-networkmanager-local-privilege-escalation/#respond)

This is was a nice design flaw that could lead to local privilege escalation. However this is not such a high impact issue since it requires unprivileged local users having access to create new network connections in PolicyKit which is disabled by default.

As we can see [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=737338), this was reported by Matt McCutchen and we can find the buggy code in src/settings/plugins/ifcfg-rh/shvar.c source code file which is shown below.

```

/* create a new string with all necessary characters escaped.
 * caller must free returned string
 */
static const char escapees[] = "\"'\\$~`";              /* must be escaped */
static const char spaces[] = " \t|&;()<>";              /* only require "" */
char *
svEscape(const char *s) {
    char *new;
    int i, j, mangle = 0, space = 0;
    int newlen, slen;
    static int esclen, splen;

    if (!esclen) esclen = strlen(escapees);
    if (!splen) splen = strlen(spaces);
    slen = strlen(s);

    for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
        if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) mangle++;
        if (strchr(spaces, s[i])) space++;
    }
    if (!mangle && !space) return strdup(s);

    newlen = slen + mangle + 3; /* 3 is extra ""\0 */
    new = g_malloc0(newlen);
    if (!new) return NULL;

    j = 0;
    new[j++] = '"';
    for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
        if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) {
            new[j++] = '\\';
        }
        new[j++] = s[i];
    }
    new[j++] = '"';
    g_assert(j == slen + mangle + 2); /* j is the index of the '\0' */

    return new;
}

```

The above C routine is used to escape some characters. So, although it does check for some characters, more specifically the following:

```

- "
- '
- \
- $
- ~
- `
- \t
- |
- &
- ;
- (
- )
- <
- >

```

It does not check for new line character at all. Because of this, as Matt McCutchen mentioned, a user could create a new wired connection with a name of for example “name” and then rename it to something similar to:

```

'test\nUSERCTL=true\n/bin/bash'

```

Where newline entered via Ctrl-Shift-U, A (as we can read [here](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=737338#c0)). Now, if the following command is executed, it will spawn a root shell.

```

usernetctl test up

```

To fix this, another array was added in the shvar.c file which contains the newline sequence of characters.

```

 static const char escapees[] = "\"'\\$~`";		/* must be escaped */
 static const char spaces[] = " \t|&;()<>";		/* only require "" */
+static const char newlines[] = "\n\r";			/* only require "" */

```

Next, a new variable to count the newlines was added in svEscape() routine as you can see here:

```

 char *
 svEscape(const char *s) {
     char *new;
-    int i, j, mangle = 0, space = 0;
+    int i, j, mangle = 0, space = 0, newline = 0;
     int newlen, slen;
     static int esclen, splen;

```

And finally, the additional newlines checks were placed in the aforementioned function.

```

     for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
 	if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) mangle++;
 	if (strchr(spaces, s[i])) space++;
+	if (strchr(newlines, s[i])) newline++;
     }
-    if (!mangle && !space) return strdup(s);
+    if (!mangle && !space && !newline) return strdup(s);

-    newlen = slen + mangle + 3;	/* 3 is extra ""\0 */
+    newlen = slen + mangle - newline + 3;	/* 3 is extra ""\0 */
     new = g_malloc0(newlen);
     if (!new) return NULL;

     j = 0;
     new[j++] = '"';
     for (i = 0; i < slen; i++) {
+	if (strchr(newlines, s[i]))
+	    continue;
 	if (strchr(escapees, s[i])) {
 	    new[j++] = '\\';
 	}
 	new[j++] = s[i];
     }
     new[j++] = '"';
-    g_assert(j == slen + mangle + 2); /* j is the index of the '\0' */
+    g_assert(j == slen + mangle - newline + 2); /* j is the index of the '\0' */

```
