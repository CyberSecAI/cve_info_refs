# Xen: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201309-24**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Xen, allowing attackers
on a Xen Virtual Machine to execute arbitrary code, cause Denial of
Service, or gain access to data on the host.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-emulation/xen** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-tools** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r3** |

| Package | **app-emulation/xen-pvgrub** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.2.2-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.2.2-r1** |

### Background

Xen is a bare-metal hypervisor.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Guest domains could possibly gain privileges, execute arbitrary code, or
cause a Denial of Service on the host domain (Dom0). Additionally, guest
domains could gain information about other virtual machines running on
the same host or read arbitrary files on the host.

### Workaround

The CVEs listed below do not currently have fixes, but only apply to Xen
setups which have “tmem” specified on the hypervisor command line.
TMEM is not currently supported for use in production systems, and
administrators using tmem should disable it.
Relevant CVEs:
\* CVE-2012-2497
\* CVE-2012-6030
\* CVE-2012-6031
\* CVE-2012-6032
\* CVE-2012-6033
\* CVE-2012-6034
\* CVE-2012-6035
\* CVE-2012-6036

### Resolution

All Xen users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-emulation/xen-4.2.2-r1"

```

All Xen-tools users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-tools-4.2.2-r3"

```

All Xen-pvgrub users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-emulation/xen-pvgrub-4.2.2-r1"

```

Vendors and users are urged to apply the attached patch.  Some defensive workarounds are available.  ISSUE DESCRIPTION =================   1. Problems  -----------  The functions which interpret the kernel image supplied for a paravirtualised guest, and decompress it into memory when booting the domain, are incautious.  Specifically:   (i) Integer overflow in the decompression loop memory allocator might      result in overrunning the buffer used for the decompressed image;  (ii) Integer overflows and lack of checking of certain length fields      can result in the loader reading its own address space beyond the      size of the supplied kernel image file.  (iii) Lack of error checking in the decompression loop can lead to an      infinite loop.   2. Impact  ---------  An attacker who can supply a kernel image to be booted as a paravirtualised guest might be able to:   (i) Escalate privilege, taking control of the management domain and     hence the entire machine.   (ii) Gain knowledge the contents of memory in the management tools.    Depending on the toolstack in use this might contain sensitive    information such as domain management or VNC passwords.   (iii) Cause an infinite loop in the management software, resulting in    denial of service (and excessive resource consumption by the    management domain).   3. Who is affected, and workarounds  -----------------------------------  Systems where the guest kernel is provided by untrusted guest administrators ARE vulnerable; this is the case whether the guest kernel is provided by ad-hoc or out-of-band means, or via the "pygrub" tool which automatically finds the kernel in the guest filesystem.  Systems which permit only blessed or approved paravirtualised kernel images to be used are NOT vulnerable; preventing attackers from providing hostile kernel images will completely prevent the attacks.  Systems which only run fully virtualised ("HVM") guests are NOT vulnerable.  With respect to each of the three specific issues:   (i) Only management domains with 32-bit userland are vulnerable.     The attack can be defeated by running the management tools with a     virtual address space ulimit of less than 2Gby, for example by     putting  "ulimit -v 1000000"  in an appropriate point in the     system startup files.   (ii) In the xen.org "xend" management toolstack this exposure is    indeed limited to VNC passwords (and general information about the    number of running domains); in such systems this attack will be    complicated to carry out and not likely to be rewarding.     In the systems using the xen.org "xl" management tool this exposure    is limited to information about the specific guest in question and    is therefore very low impact.   (iii) This attack is very easy to carry out but the impact is low.    Running VMs are not adversely affected.  There is no known    workaround.  In theory it might be possible to pre-validate kernel images.  Images which are accepted and booted by a fixed version of xen are safe to pass to unfixed versions.    4. Patch information  --------------------  The proposed patch is attached.  There are three separate versions:     cve-2011-1583-4.1.patch        for Xen 4.1    cve-2011-1583-4.0.patch        for Xen 3.4 and 4.0    cve-2011-1583-unstable.patch   for the xen-unstable development tree  $ sha256sum cve-2011-1583-*.patch  f51b774eec945c48a0e91ed17df3cee07027d64c7e7c5783f7446507dbcc201b   cve-2011-1583-4.0.patch 2a54dbb1984a966e8d90da9f4fb10c30ff197d13603943c38488122044bb977d   cve-2011-1583-4.1.patch 0299618a56c9ad86d41a1d9879cb373bdef5105592f9a1f2390af3bf94c404be   cve-2011-1583-unstable.patch $ sha1sum cve-2011-1583-*.patch  41e2a653313d13a036e30c1c160e402e380bc377  cve-2011-1583-4.0.patch d2bad52b255d7475709b49420db4ce41b2a108f3  cve-2011-1583-4.1.patch 0b25612d708c71143498d52af276721a4bf1c3fa  cve-2011-1583-unstable.patch $  These have been applied and pushed to xen-unstable.hg (23322:d9982136d8fa), xen-4.1-testing (23042:e2e575f8b5d9) and xen-4.0-testing (21482:c2adc059e931).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
