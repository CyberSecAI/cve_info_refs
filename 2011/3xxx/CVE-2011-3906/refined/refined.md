Based on the provided content:

**CVE-2011-3906** is described as a **Medium** severity vulnerability involving an **out-of-bounds read in the PDF parser** of Google Chrome.

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the PDF parser that allows for an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which occurs when the software attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially lead to information disclosure, denial-of-service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if combined with another vulnerability.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a specially crafted PDF document that triggers the out-of-bounds read when processed by the vulnerable PDF parser in Google Chrome.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to deliver a malicious PDF file to a user running a vulnerable version of Google Chrome. This could be achieved by hosting the file on a web page, sending it via email, or using other methods to get the victim to open it.
