Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `Referer` HTTP header within the Netvolution CMS (ASP implementation). The application fails to neutralize special characters within the `Referer` header before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability (CWE-89)
- Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
- Blind SQL injection specifically, as the application does not directly reveal SQL errors or results.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Modification of content on the vulnerable website
- Injection of malicious JavaScript code into a visitor's browser
- Collection of CMS usernames and plaintext passwords
- In some cases, execution of commands on the system hosting the database server
- The attack may go undetected as header fields might not be logged.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted HTTP `Referer` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Remote attacker without prior authentication is required.
- The attacker needs the capability to send HTTP requests with modified headers to a vulnerable Netvolution website.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found in the ASP implementation of Netvolution v2.5.8, and may affect other versions as well.
- The exploit is performed through blind SQL injection techniques.
- The provided proof of concept uses the sqlmap tool to demonstrate the vulnerability and extract database information.
- The vendor has released an update to address this issue.
- This is considered a critical vulnerability due to the ease of exploitation, lack of authentication requirement, and potential for undetected attacks.
