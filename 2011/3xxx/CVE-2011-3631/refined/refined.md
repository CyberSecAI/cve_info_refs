Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3631:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Multiple integer overflows occur when concatenating string lengths during the calculation of required memory space in `hardlink`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflows:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of multiple integer overflows during string length calculations.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflows:** The integer overflows lead to heap-based buffer overflows due to insufficient memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Crash:** Exploitation can lead to the `hardlink` executable crashing.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running `hardlink`. This means an attacker could execute malicious code on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Crafted Directory Tree:** An attacker can craft a directory tree with very long directory and file names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** An attacker can perform this attack remotely.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a local user into running the vulnerable `hardlink` on the crafted directory tree.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects the C version of `hardlink`.
- The python version of hardlink was also found to be affected by a similar issue.
- This vulnerability is related to how `hardlink` calculates the required memory to store file paths, and manipulating path lengths allows an attacker to cause the overflow.
- This is considered a **High** severity vulnerability with a CVSS score of 8.8.
- Patches for this vulnerability were made available with `hardlink` version 0.1.2 and later, where proper checks were added to prevent the integer overflows.

The provided text also indicates that multiple Linux distributions, including Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Debian and Ubuntu were affected, though different versions of the `hardlink` package (C and Python) were present within them. Patches were made available to address this issue in various distributions.
