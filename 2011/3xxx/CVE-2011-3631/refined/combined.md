* [References](#references)

Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based
buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in
the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user
into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially
arbitrary code execution with user privileges.

# CVE-2011-3631

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2011-3630.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2011-3632.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2011-3631 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3631)

#### Description

Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with user privileges.

Hi Julian,
   A security problem in hardlink had been reported:
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/15/2>

   The report refers to Fedora. Can you check if any Debian version is affected?

Thanks a lot!

It affects a version of hardlink written in C. Our version is
written in Python. Both have the same name, but are implemented
differently.

According to my knowledge the C version of hardlink(1) was not packaged
anywhere when I wrote the Python version (and just a .c file distributed
from people.redhat.com, and unmaintained).

Well, they are implemented differently but still both affected
by the attack stated in [CVE-2011-3632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3632). The following patch will
be included in the next release of hardlink.

 [CVE-2011-3632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3632))

It seems that we are just as well affected by the same problem
as [CVE-2011-3632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3632) in the original hardlink.c tool.

+.B hardlink
+assumes that the trees it operates on do not change during
+operation. If a tree does change, the result is undefined and potentially
+dangerous. For example, if a regular file is replaced by a device, hardlink
+may start reading from the device. If a component of a path is replaced by

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=746710#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:33:22 UTC  ``` Multiple integer overflows, leading to heap-based buffer overflows were found in the way hardlink, the tool for consolidation of duplicate files via hardlinks performed string lengths concatenation in the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree (with long directory and / or file names), and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

# CVE-2011-3631

| **Name** | CVE-2011-3631 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially arbitrary code execution with user privileges. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3631) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-3631); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2011-3631), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2011-3631), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2011-3631), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2011-3631), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3631), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3631), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3631), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3631)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3631/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2011-3631)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2011-3631%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2011-3631%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2011-3631%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |
