Subject: Re: CVE request: Joomla unspecified information
 disclosure vulnerability

Path Disclosure should better be regarded as more closely related to
server-side issue.
It may be too redundant or unnecessary to create one path disclosure
issue per CVE.

Another Path Disclosure issue in Joomla! 1.6.1

<http://bl0g.yehg.net/2011/04/joomla-161-and-lower-information.html>

Almost all php CMS applications have this issue going on where  some
of them are listed at:

<http://code.google.com/p/inspathx/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpaths_vuln>

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-apps/mantisbt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.2.11** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.2.11** |

### Background

MantisBT is a PHP/MySQL/Web based bugtracking system.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in MantisBT. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct
directory traversal attacks, disclose the contents of local files, inject
arbitrary web scripts, obtain sensitive information, bypass
authentication and intended access restrictions, or manipulate bugs and
attachments.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All MantisBT users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-apps/mantisbt-1.2.11"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
