However, Time Machine did not require that the SRP-based authentication mechanism was used for subsequent backup operations, even if Time Machine was initially configured or had ever contacted a Time Capsule or Base Station that supported it. An attacker who is able to spoof the remote volume could gain access to user's Time Capsule credentials, although not backup data, sent by the user's system. This issue is addressed by requiring use of the SRP-based authentication mechanism if the backup destination has ever supported it.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=771896#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-01-05 10:46:57 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the way libxml2 decoded an entity reference with a long name. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an application linked against libxml would cause that application to crash, or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.  Reference: <http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2012/01/stable-channel-update.html> Patch: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=5bd3c061823a8499b27422aee04ea20aae24f03e>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=771896#c6)  Huzaifa S.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=787067#c0)  Kurt Seifried    2012-02-03 04:55:24 UTC  ``` Juraj Somorovsky and Christopher Meyer reported that certain XML parsers/servers are affected by the same, or similar, flaw as the hash table collisions CPU usage denial of service.  Sending a specially crafted message to an XML service can result in longer processing time, which could lead to a denial of service.  It is reported that this attack on XML can be applied on different XML nodes (such as entities, element attributes, namespaces, various elements in the XML security, etc.).  libxml2 is written in C and makes significant use of arrays. I will contact  upstream to make them aware of this issue.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=787067#c16)  Huzaifa S.

# RHSA-2013:0217 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Important: mingw32-libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0217)

## Topic

Updated mingw32-libxml2 packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This advisory also contains
information about future updates for the mingw32 packages, as well as the
deprecation of the packages with the release of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the libxml2 library, a development toolbox providing
the implementation of various XML standards, for users of MinGW (Minimalist
GNU for Windows).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mingw32 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will no
longer be updated proactively and will be deprecated with the release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4. These packages were provided to support other
capabilities in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and were not intended for direct
customer use. Customers are advised to not use these packages with
immediate effect. Future updates to these packages will be at Red Hat's
discretion and these packages may be removed in a future minor release.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2011-3919)

A heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5134)

It was found that the hashing routine used by libxml2 arrays was
susceptible to predictable hash collisions. Sending a specially-crafted
message to an XML service could result in longer processing time, which
could lead to a denial of service. To mitigate this issue, randomization
has been added to the hashing function to reduce the chance of an attacker
successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-0841)

Multiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath (XML Path
Language) expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a
specially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an
XPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494,
CVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain XML files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216,
CVE-2011-3102)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker
were able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using
libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against
the crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an
application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2011-3905)

Red Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the
CVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-4008.

All users of mingw32-libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
