Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Zikula web application framework did not properly sanitize the `themename` parameter. This lack of sanitization occurs when setting a theme as default, modifying, or deleting it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A remote attacker, with Zikula administrator privileges, could inject arbitrary HTML or web script code into the context of the affected website. This allows for the execution of malicious scripts within the victim's browser session, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL that includes malicious javascript code in the `themename` parameter.
- Specifically, the vulnerable functionality is related to setting, modifying, or deleting themes within the Zikula admin interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator-level privileges to access the Zikula admin interface where theme settings are managed.
- The attacker needs the ability to send a crafted URL to the victim, which when visited, will execute the malicious script in the victim's browser.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in Zikula versions 1.3.0, build #3168 and probably prior.
- The issue was fixed in Zikula 1.3.1
- The provided PoC URL is:
  `http://host/index.php?module=theme&type=admin&func=setasdefault&themename=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28document.cookie%29%3C/script%3E`
  This demonstrates how the `themename` parameter can be used to inject a script.

- It's noted that the versions of Zikula shipped with Fedora 14 and 15, as well as those in EPEL-5 and EPEL-6, were not affected, as they did not contain the vulnerable code.
- There is mention of a possible duplicate CVE identifier, CVE-2011-3979, but CVE-2011-3352 was determined to be the primary one.
