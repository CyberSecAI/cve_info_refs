| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=736707#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-08 13:13:58 UTC  ``` It was found that the Zikula web application framework did not properly sanitize the 'themename' parameter, while setting particular theme as a default one, modifying the theme or deleting it. A remote attacker, with Zikula administrator privilege, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary HTML or web script code in the context of the affected website.

Checking with Mitre: [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/04/3>  which CVE identifier is the proper one to be used to reference to this issue.
