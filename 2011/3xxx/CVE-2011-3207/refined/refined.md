Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in OpenSSL's internal certificate revocation list (CRL) verification routines. Under certain circumstances, these routines can incorrectly accept a CRL even if its `nextUpdate` field is in the past. This means that an outdated CRL could be considered valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper CRL verification
- Failure to check the validity period of the CRL based on the `nextUpdate` field.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker might be able to bypass certificate revocation checks. This could lead to the acceptance of revoked certificates, which could enable various types of attacks, such as:
- Impersonation of a legitimate entity
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Access to protected resources by using compromised certificates that should have been revoked.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the use of an outdated CRL.
- This is a network based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the CRL that is being used for certificate verification.
- They also need to have a revoked certificate that would normally fail the revocation check.
- The attacker must control the CRL used, or inject one that has an expired nextUpdate field.
-  The application must have enabled OpenSSLâ€™s internal CRL checking (which is off by default). Specifically, by setting the verification flag `X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK` or `X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL`. Applications using custom CRL checking are not affected.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.0d.
- It was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0e.
- Red Hat stated that their Enterprise Linux versions 4, 5 and 6 were not affected due to the specific versions of OpenSSL they shipped.
- HP Insight Control Software for Linux (IC-Linux) was also affected by this vulnerability and was fixed in version 7.0.
