| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-15 09:51:59 UTC  ``` It was found that Ruby did not properly reinitialize the random number generator, when forking new Ruby process. A local attacker could use this flaw to easier predict random numbers.

(I'm not sure why MITRE assigned [CVE-2011-3009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3009) to this as it sounds like this is an exact duplicate of CVE-2011-2686; I've inquired as to what makes this different from [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686)).   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c16)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-21 15:13:52 UTC  ``` I've not heard anything back from MITRE about the difference, but I've looked at the CVE entry for [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) and it reads:  Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to [CVE-2003-0900](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2003-0900). NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.   Which has me a bit more confused.  By the sounds of the description, [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) was fixed in 1.8.6, but regressed which caused the flaw in 1.8.7 (I have no idea if this is the case).  I suspect we should use [CVE-2011-2686](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2686) to describe any fixes in 1.8.6 and [CVE-2011-3009](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3009) to describe any fixes in 1.8.7.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 12:08:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1581 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1581.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c22)  Vít Ondruch    2012-01-13 15:21:32 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 555084](attachment.cgi?id=555084&action=diff "RHEL-5.8 patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=555084&action=edit "RHEL-5.8 patch") RHEL-5.8 patch   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=722415#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-30 18:33:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0070 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0070.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-01 15:21:30 UTC  ``` Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink reported a flaw in the hash function used in the implementation of the Ruby arrays implemented using the hash table.  A specially-crafted set of keys could trigger hash function collisions, which degrade hash table performance by changing hash table operations complexity from an expected/average O(1) to the worst case O(n).  Reporters were able to find colliding strings efficiently using equivalent substrings or meet in the middle techniques.  As various web application frameworks for Ruby automatically pre-fill certain arrays with data from the HTTP request (such as GET or POST parameters) for Ruby web application, a remote attacker could use this flaw to make Ruby interpreter use excessive amount of CPU time by sending a POST request with large amount of parameters which hash to the same value.  This problem is similar to the issue that was previously reported for and fixed in e.g. perl:   <http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf>  Note: This issue did not affect Ruby 1.9, which already randomizes hash function in a similar way perl does.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-01 15:23:49 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting this issue. oCERT acknowledges Julian Wälde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c11)  KOSAKI Motohiro    2011-11-30 17:49:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 538673](attachment.cgi?id=538673&action=diff "Proposed patch by ruby security team.")

Also, we agreed ruby core team release new patch level release at the same day with the unembargo date (i.e Dec 27), it is called ruby-1.8.7p357.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c15)  Vít Ondruch    2011-12-12 14:49:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c12))  Hi Motohiro,  Thank you for the patch and the information abour Ruby release schedule. However, could you please elaborate what is the fix actually fixing? What is the actual cause of the slowness?  If I read the patch correctly, it seems, that you are going to significantly decrease the possibility of the DOS, because you added the random seed, therefore it is now statistically low chance that attacker would be successful, but the chances are not 0. Am I right?   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c16)  KOSAKI Motohiro    2011-12-12 15:50:04 UTC  ``` Hi Vit,  following is my draft paper of the security announce. I hope this help you understand.  The problem are - If there are hash collisioned string, string performance may decrease a lot.   So an attacker may try to make billion collisioned string intentionally. - Current hash function is too simple and attacker can easily make reverse hash   function. IOW, to make collision is very easy. - More unfortunately, ruby 1.8 use the same hash seed every time. Then, an   attacker can make collisioned string on their local machine. - An attacker can send lots string at ones by using HTTP POST parameter into   the target host.  OK?  If an attacker needs enough a lot of time to make hash collision strings, admin can prevent the attack by simply restarting the server.  To clarify, you have good point.  We had two ways to fix 1) fix too simple ruby hash 2) fix Rails that don't have enough DoS detection.  We chose 1) because it can fix all ruby application framework by one fix.   Ruby upstream advisory draft:  Denial of service attack was found for Ruby's Hash algorithm  Impact:  This is  something related  to computational complexity.   A specially crafted  series  of strings  that  intentionally  collides their  hash values each other was found.   With the sequence an attacker can issue a denial  of service  attack by, for  instance, giving the  strings as POST parameters of HTTP requests for your Rails application.  This is  a DoS  threat.  We  have not yet  been successful  to execute arbitrary codes by exploiting this vulnerability.  <"続きを読む" tag here>  Detailed description:  The situation is similar to the one  found for Perl in 2003.  We use a deterministic hash  function to  hash a string,  where "deterministic" means no  other bits  of information than  the input string  itself is involved to generate a hash  code.  So you can precalculate a string's hash   code  beforehand  (given   ruby's  open-sourced   nature).   By collecting a series of strings  that have the identical hash value, an attacker  can let  ruby process  collide  bins of  hash tables.   Hash tables' amortized O(1) attribute depends on uniformity of distribution of hash  values.  By  giving such crafted  input, an attacker  can let hash tables work much slower  than expected (namely O(n2) to construct a n-elements hash this case).  Affected versions:  - - Ruby 1.8.7-p352 and all prior versions.  All  Ruby 1.9  series are  not affected.   They are  relatively modern implementations, already prepared to this kind of attack.  Solution:  Our  solution  is  to  scramble  the  string  hash  function  by  some PRNG-generated random bits.  By doing  so a string's hashed code is no longer deterministic.   That is, a `String#hash`  result is consistent only for current process lifetime and will generate a different number for the next boot.  To break  this situation an attacker must create a set of strings  which are robust to this kind  of scrambling, which is believed to be quite difficult.  Please upgrade to the latest version of ruby via <修正版へのリンク>.  Notes:  * Bear in  mind that our  hash algorithm is  still _cryptographically_  _insecure_.  To put it simple, we fixed the hash table but we didn't  fix  `String#hash` weakness.   An attacker  coudld still  exploit it  once he  / she got a  pair of a  string and its hash  value returned  from  `String#hash`.    You  _must_  _not_   disclose  `String#hash`  outputs.  If you need to  do such things, consider using secure hash  algorithms instead.  Some  of them (such as SHA256)  are provided in  Ruby's standard library.  * In fact,  we have traditionally been providing  two alternative hash  algorithms, apart  from the default  one.  They are  only accessible  via recompiling a  ruby binary with magical C  compiler flags.  Most  of you don't  even know it.  I have never seen  their used in actual  situations.  If you  know about them and you do use  one of them, do  so at  your own risk please.   By choosing them we  consider you can  read C, and you can understand  what was wrong with the default one.  Make sure that your choice is safe.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c17)  Vít Ondruch    2011-12-12 16:58:54 UTC  ``` Hi Motohiro,  Thank you for the announcement draft. It is very well written and it confirms my suspicion. However I am still interested in one point:  (In reply to [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=750564#c16)) >  - If there are hash collisioned string, string performance may decrease a lot. > So an attacker >     may try to make billion collisioned string intentionally.

Looking at the above patches, there seems to be two issues here, perhaps
it needs two CVE ids to be assigned?

1. <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=31713>

This one pertains to rand returning same values in forked processes.
<http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/4338>
This is a regression, as it was fixed in 1.8.6-p114, but re-appeared in
1.8.6-p399.

2. <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=32050>

This is an issue in the securerandom.rb module.
<http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4579>

Josh,

Can we please assign CVE-2011-2686 to one of the issues and have another
CVE id to the other issue?

Thanks.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Synopsis

Moderate: ruby security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0070)

## Topic

Updated ruby packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Ruby is an extensible, interpreted, object-oriented, scripting language. It
has features to process text files and to do system management tasks.

A denial of service flaw was found in the implementation of associative
arrays (hashes) in Ruby. An attacker able to supply a large number of
inputs to a Ruby application (such as HTTP POST request parameters sent to
a web application) that are used as keys when inserting data into an array
could trigger multiple hash function collisions, making array operations
take an excessive amount of CPU time. To mitigate this issue, randomization
has been added to the hash function to reduce the chance of an attacker
successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2011-4815)

It was found that Ruby did not reinitialize the PRNG (pseudorandom number
generator) after forking a child process. This could eventually lead to the
PRNG returning the same result twice. An attacker keeping track of the
values returned by one child process could use this flaw to predict the
values the PRNG would return in other child processes (as long as the
parent process persisted). (CVE-2011-3009)

Red Hat would like to thank oCERT for reporting CVE-2011-4815. oCERT
acknowledges Julian Walde and Alexander Klink as the original reporters of
CVE-2011-4815.

All users of ruby are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.
