Here's a breakdown of the information regarding CVE-2011-3389 from the provided content:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of CVE-2011-3389 lies within the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols themselves, specifically how they handle Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode. The protocols use predictable initialization vectors (IVs) by taking the last ciphertext block of a previous message as the IV for the next message. This predictability allows an attacker to perform a chosen-plaintext attack.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Initialization Vectors (IVs):**  The core weakness is that the IVs for CBC encryption are not randomly generated, but are derived from previous ciphertext blocks, making them predictable.
*   **CBC Mode Vulnerability:** Using symmetric encryption algorithms in CBC mode is susceptible to this attack.
*   **Lack of Implementation of TLS 1.1/1.2:** Older SSL/TLS libraries and server software often lack support for the newer TLS 1.1 and 1.2 protocols, which are not susceptible to this vulnerability.
*   **DownGrade Attacks:** The vulnerability can be exploited in cases where a higher version of SSL/TLS (e.g., TLS 1.1 or 1.2) is not supported on either the client or the server, causing a fallback to a vulnerable protocol (SSL 3.0 or TLS 1.0).

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can decrypt portions of encrypted SSL/TLS traffic, potentially exposing sensitive information like authentication cookies.
*   **Potential for Full Decryption:** With enough requests, an attacker can decrypt the entire communication.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept the encrypted traffic. This often occurs when a user connects through an insecure network such as public WiFi.
*   **Browser-Based Attack:** A typical attack scenario involves an attacker injecting malicious code (e.g., JavaScript or a Java applet) into a website that the user visits. This malicious code makes numerous requests to a targeted HTTPS server, which the attacker then intercepts. This code uses the weakness to create chosen-plaintext, allowing decryption of the requests.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the encrypted communication between the client (e.g., browser) and the server.
*   **Code Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to execute malicious code within the victim's browser, either by tricking the user into loading a malicious website or through other browser vulnerabilities.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker must understand how the predictable IV is used to decrypt the communication.
*   **Ability to trigger multiple requests:** The attack requires the ability to initiate a number of requests to the target server, using data that the attacker controls.
*   **Same-Origin Policy (SOP) Bypass (for Browser-based attack):** When using java applets, the attacker requires an SOP bypass to send requests to arbitrary websites.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions from various content:**

*   **WinHTTP Component:**  The Microsoft security bulletin MS12-006 emphasizes that the vulnerability affects the WinHTTP component. The update modifies how WinHTTP sends and receives packets to mitigate the vulnerability. However, the bulletin states that to protect from the web-based attack using Internet Explorer, both MS12-006 and MS11-099 need to be applied.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Prioritizing RC4 algorithm in the server software was suggested to avoid block ciphers in CBC mode, but RC4 also has weaknesses and may not be suitable for some environments.
    *   Enabling TLS 1.1/1.2 in client and server software would avoid the issue altogether, but this is not always possible due to compatibility issues.
*   **Browser-Specific Mitigations:**
    *   Google Chrome implemented a workaround that addressed the immediate issue of clients being attacked. This involved adjustments to how the browser sends packets, but was still vulnerable without the server-side fixes.
    *   Mozilla Firefox eventually implemented record splitting as well.
    *   Opera patched the vulnerability.
*    **Java Applets:** A Java applet can be used to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP) and initiate requests. This highlights the importance of keeping Java and browser plugins updated, or disabling them when possible.
*   **NSS Library:** The Network Security Services (NSS) library has a mitigation which can be enabled to avoid this vulnerability.
*   **BEAST Attack Name:** It was discovered that this attack was given the name "BEAST" by its authors.
*  **Java Vulnerability:** This CVE has been noted to affect Java and its libraries. Updates to the JRE and JDK are necessary to address the vulnerability within Java environments.

**Summary:**

The content collectively highlights the nature of CVE-2011-3389 as a protocol-level flaw rather than a software bug, emphasizing the need for comprehensive solutions including both client and server-side updates. It also showcases the complex interactions required to exploit the vulnerability, and the different methods used to mitigate it, including prioritization of RC4, and moving to higher TLS versions. Multiple vendors across various software such as Java, browsers, and libraries had to implement specific measures to prevent successful exploitation of this vulnerability.
