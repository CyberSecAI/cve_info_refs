How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0. This vulnerability affects the protocol itself and is not specific to the Windows operating system. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if an attacker intercepts encrypted web traffic served from an affected system. TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and all cipher suites that do not use CBC mode are not affected.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that the Windows Secure Channel (SChannel) component sends and receives encrypted network packets. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2588513](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2588513).

## SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 encryption protocols. This vulnerability affects the protocol itself and is not specific to the Windows operating system. This is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows the decryption of encrypted SSL/TLS traffic. This vulnerability primarily impacts HTTPS traffic, since the browser is the primary attack vector, and all web traffic served via HTTPS or mixed content HTTP/HTTPS is affected.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3389](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3389).

#### Mitigating Factors for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and all cipher suites that do not use CBC mode are not affected.

#### Workarounds for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prioritize the RC4 Algorithm in server software on systems running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2**

  The attack only affects cipher suites that use symmetric encryption algorithms in CBC mode, such as AES, and does not affect the RC4 algorithm. You can prioritize the RC4 algorithm in server software in order to facilitate secure communication using RC4 instead of CBC. Refer to this MSDN article, [Prioritizing Schannel Cipher Suites](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb870930%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), to learn how to perform this operation.

  **Warning** The client or server with which you are communicating must support the RC4 algorithm. If support for RC4 is not available, a different cipher suite will be used if one is available, and this workaround will be ineffective.
* **Enable TLS 1.1 and/or 1.2 in client software on systems running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2**

  You can enable a different version of the TLS protocol that is not affected by this vulnerability. You can do this by modifying the Advanced Security settings of Internet Explorer.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2643584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2643584) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround for TLS 1.1.

  **Interactive Method**

  To change the default protocol version to be used for HTTPS requests, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Advanced** tab.

#### FAQ for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability could decrypt portions of encrypted traffic and retrieve information such as authentication cookies.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a design flaw in the SSL and TLS protocols when Cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode of operation is used.

**What are TLS and SSL?**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol is responsible for the authentication and key exchange necessary to establish or resume secure sessions. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a predecessor of the Transport Layer Security protocol. Both TLS and SSL perform the same functions and support secure network communications using a combination of public and secret key technology.

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker monitoring an encrypted communication who successfully exploited this vulnerability could decrypt the intercepted encrypted traffic.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could inject malicious code in an HTTP response or host a specially crafted website containing malicious code, forcing the browser to execute this malicious code. This code sends several requests, inside the same TLS/SSL session, to a third party HTTPS website, where cookies are sent automatically if a previous authenticated session exists. This is a required condition in order to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to intercept this HTTPS traffic in order to exploit this vulnerability in SSL, resulting in the possibility to decrypt portions of the encrypted traffic (for example, authentication cookies).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Since the browser is the primary attack vector, any systems, such as workstations or terminal servers, that send and receive HTTPS traffic are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that the Windows Secure Channel (SChannel) component sends and receives encrypted network packets. This addresses the vulnerability affecting WinHTTP and provides the possibility to enable the protection system-wide. However, in order to be protected from the web-based attack vector through Internet Explorer for this vulnerability, customers must install both this update, MS12-006, and the [Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=232505) (2618444), MS11-099.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-3389](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3389).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

[September 25, 2011](https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2011/09/beast.html "permanent link")

So we gave a talk and a live demo at ekoparty last week to show how BEAST exploits a weakness in SSL to decrypt secret cookies.

Please note that BEAST does not do any harm to remote servers. In fact, no packet from BEAST has ever been sent to any servers. We chose PayPal because they do everything right when it comes to server-side SSL, and that is good to demonstrate the power of BEAST, which is a client-side SSL attack. We reported the vulnerability to browser, plugin and SSL vendors several months ago (CVE-2011-3389).

Current version of BEAST consists of Javascript/applet agents and a network sniffer. We have some choices for the agent. At the time we reported the bug to vendors, HTML5 WebSockets could be used to build a BEAST agent but, due to unrelated reasons, the WebSockets protocol was already in the process of changing in such a way that stopped it. We can't use the new WebSockets protocol shipped with browsers. We use a Java applet in this video, but please be aware that it may be possible to implement a Javascript agent with XMLHttpRequest as well. Why don't you take a look? ;-)

Note that it is relatively easy to run a script or an applet in your browser without you doing anything (e.g, by intercepting any HTTP requests from your browser.) After all, each agent is just a piece of Javascript or an applet. Once an agent has been loaded, BEAST can patiently wait until you sign in to some valuable websites to steal your accounts.

In order to make the Java applet agent work, we have to bypass the same-origin policy (SOP). Some people have gotten the impression that BEAST required an SOP bypass bug to work and so it's not a threat by itself. That's not true. It is well known that even with a SOP bypass in Java, you can't read [existing](http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_Java) [cookies](http://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2010/10/java-applet-same-ip-host-access.html). You can send requests and may read responses (which may include new cookies), but no, you can't read existing cookies. In the video (and the live demo as well,) we show clearly that we decrypt \_existing\_ cookies that were already stored in the browser's cookie jar. During our research, we indeed found a Java SOP bypass. We wanted to focus on more important parts of BEAST such as the actual crypto attack and optimizations, so we stopped looking for alternatives, and used the SOP vulnerability to make an agent.

A. Shamir (the S in RSA) once said "Cryptography is typically bypassed, not penetrated," and please keep reading if you are curious what happened during our anecdote of penetrating crypto.

It began with the alleged backdoor in OpenBSD's IPSEC stack. One day in late December 2010 Juliano sent me an email telling me that he got a new idea. He was at some beach in Indonesia reading [tls-cbc.txt](http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt) (I know that beach and TLS and CBC should not appear in the same sentence but, well, maybe he's not very interested in bikinis) and he came up with the chosen-boundary attack. In hindsight, it's obvious that somebody would think of that when they read about Dai's attack. In hindsight, however, everything is obvious. It takes somebody like Juliano to have such a good idea. I am so lucky that he always shares his ideas with me. I wrote some test cases (using the wonderful [tlslite](http://trevp.net/tlslite/) library), and after some hours, my conclusion was... it can't work in browsers. I then moved to the States, and was busy with new life, new job and schooling, so I didn't have time to research that idea any further, even after Juliano kept asking me to check it again. Don't listen to me if I tell you your attack can't work :-). Don't listen to anybody telling you that.

Fast forward to early April. I was working on some project at Matasano, and some SSL code that I saw that day made me realize that I wrote wrong tests for Juliano's idea. In fact, it seems that I didn't quite understand it back then. As soon as I got back home, I re-read Juliano's email, my notes and scripts. I decided that I needed to make it work with pen and paper first, so I drew some diagrams. The result looked hopeful. I then modified the test cases, re-ran them, and for the first time, I saw that chosen-boundary attack may work. That moment was so wonderful. It turns out that I had to "reverse" the idea to make it "compatible" with browsers, and after some more hours, not only I saw that the attack is possible, but I also understood which conditions I need to make it really work. The conditions looked easy too. I was very excited. I would have screamed loudly hahaha. I took note of what I had seen so far, and sent it to Juliano.

At first, Juliano didn't understand my note (because it's a reverse of his idea,) but he caught up very quickly, and he agreed that it looks doable. So the main condition is to be able to send two SSL records in the same cookie-bearing request (if you've read the leaked draft, we call this the blockwise privilege.) We were both very excited, because at that moment we know that it is just a matter of browser features for us to create a reliable exploit for something that people have thought un-exploitable in years.

I collected a list of browser features and plugins that allow me to send cookie-bearing requests. I took a look at the [Browser Security Handbook](http://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Main) by Michal Zalewski, and found some candidates: Javascript XMLHttpRequest, Java URLConnection, Flash URLRequest, and Silverlight WebClient API. We really wanted to make the attack work with native Javascript, so we spent a lot of time on XMLHttpRequest object. At some point, Juliano and I were even reading C++ source code of various browsers (which is even harder to understand than assembly as a friend once said.) Maybe we've missed something really obvious, but we've never made XMLHttpRequest work the way we need. It was both surprising and frustrating that it is so hard to open full-duplex channels do request streaming in modern browsers. People have to invent a lot of ugly bitches that known as Comet techniques. I studied every single one of them, but none of them meets what we need. I also studied HTML5 WebSockets, then concluded that it's not what I need because it includes a \x00 byte in front of every packet. More about WebSockets in a moment.

So I moved on to Java URLConnection. I'd never written an applet before, but researching is doing exactly things that you haven't done before. So I wrote an applet, and tried to make it perform the blockwise step. The Internet is really helpful. I found a wonderful [URLConnection mini-guide](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793150/how-to-use-java-net-urlconnection-to-fire-and-handle-http-requests) in Stack Overflow. I also wrote a small SSL server to test my applet. It worked as expected. I could open a request, append more data to it as long as I want, and each time I "flush" the output stream, Java would send out a record in the same SSL connection. So wonderful, but I want more. I want something that works without any plugins. Once again I started writing tests for XMLHttpRequest, reading C++ code, or studying Comet. Rinse and repeat. Nothing worked.

One day while in the shower, I realized that those things haven't worked simply because they can't work. That's why people have to invent WebSockets. Hmm, why couldn't I use WebSockets? I re-read my note. So they have a \x00 prefix, which prevents me from fully controlling the chosen block. I remembered that [Bellare et al.](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/ssh.html) also had the same problem when they tried to attack SSH, so I re-read their paper. I was quite disappointed to know that they didn't describe any practical way to solve that problem. Then I came up with the idea of chaining of predictable IV. I wrote a small WebSockets simulator to test it, and it works. Not very fast though, since WebSockets requires that my chosen block to be a valid UTF-8 string. It's funny that we also had to deal with UTF-8 in the ASP.NET exploit. Anyway, it doesn't need any plugins. It was late April.

We split the work. I wanted to work on the paper, and Juliano wanted to work on the exploit. I started writing right away, but Juliano had to delay the exploit several months later. He got a name for it anyway. "This thing is so complicated. I would like to call it B.E.A.S.T so people kind of get stuck calling it 'the BEAST attack'. We can figure out what BEAST means later."

Writing in English has never been easy for both of us. It took us several months with a lot of help from friends to finish the ASP.NET paper, and I couldn't believe that I had to write another one even before releasing that paper. But I did eventually. Along the way, I found Bard's papers, which was extremely helpful for me. I read his paper carefully. So many "We believe". I have to confess that I am a non-believer, so I made a rule for myself: no "We believe" in my paper. Anyway, although Bard's attacks can't work, his papers were written in very nice English. So I stole a lot of phrases, expressions and statements from him. Of course I cited him many times.

So I kept writing, and Juliano helped with editing. By mid May, we finally had something good enough to ask for review from friends. I guess that no "We believe" is a good rule, since everybody said that the paper is easy to understand. We also got an awesome review from [Kenny Paterson](http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/~kp/). If you happen to write a crypto paper, and need some cryptographer to review it, you may want to ask Kenny. He's very friendly, encouraging, and his review always teaches us a lot.

So we got a not-so-bad paper, but still no actual exploit because Juliano was still in some beach somewhere. We agreed that we should contact browser and SSL vendors early so that they can work on the patch, since we planned to (but didn't) release something in July. We sent the paper to Google, Mozilla, Apple, Microsoft, Opera and Oracle. All of them responded very quickly, which is pretty impressing. Mozilla created [bug 665814](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665814), and it became the discussion board of all people working on the fix. Later I discovered that there were also people from IETF and other vendors that we didn't contact.

It turns out that fixing this is not easy, because every proposed solution is incompatible with some existing SSL applications. OpenSSL has already included a fix several years ago, but it is turned off by default, thanks to Internet Explorer 6's broken SSL implementation. Somebody also pointed out that due to another attack released in March, the WebSockets protocol was already in the process of changing in such a way that stopped our attack. People kept asking for a working PoC, but we could not give them anything. At some point, it seemed that no vendor wanted to patch this. We also started losing interest in convincing them. We got more compliments from cryptographers we contacted.

We didn't release anything in July as planned, since nothing has been fixed. Instead we went to BlackHat, won a pwnie for the ASP.NET bug, delivered a presentation on the attack at Matasano's private dinner. People liked it. We got several follow-up emails and an invitation to present it again at some internal conference of a client. Juliano and some other friends rooted all servers and yet lost their CTF game. Still no actually BEAST. "We can work together on BEAST when I visit you next week", but we ended up drinking all nights. So many hi 5...

Then Juliano submited the talk to ekoparty. Opera patched. We got excited. That was five weeks ago.

Juliano told me that the talk got 10/10 rating from all of the judges, and he felt that it's time to give birth to BEAST. Since WebSockets is not a good option anymore, and there was so little time to research other alternatives, we agreed that we should focus on Java and Silverlight. He worked and worked and worked. It turns out that BEAST is not easy to code. At some point, Juliano had to install Windows and Visual Studio to write a Silverlight applet in, cough cough, VB.NET. Well, he has to do things he's never done before.

BEAST finally decrypted the first byte of some cookies. It is so surreal to witness some idea that exists only in your mind actually evolves into working code. Moments like this are very rewarding, and it makes researching very worth doing. Juliano was so tired, so I asked him to send the code to me. This is why we've enjoyed doing things together. We can make progress as long as there is at least one guy up. He has done the heavy work, now it's my turn to baby-sit BEAST.

I installed Eclipse, learned Java, and started hacking the code. Since Juliano stopped as soon as BEAST decrypts the first byte, I had to fix bugs to make it decrypt more bytes more reliably. The next thing I did was to find a way to bypass the same-origin policy (SOP) with some agent. A friend was so generous that he gave me one of his Java 0-days to bypass SOP. Anyway, that bug has a dependency that we couldn't satisfy, so I had to find another one. I started reviewing [JVM's source code](http://javasourcecode.org/). Honestly, I didn't expect to find a SOP bypass, but I did. What interesting is that the bug is very good for BEAST, but not so good for other types of attackers. You need to be able to do MiTM to use it. Well, that makes sense when you know that I found the bug when I was MiTM-ing a Java applet. I could look for other ways to create an agent, but both of us agreed that we should focus on optimizations. I needed to make BEAST fast. The version that Juliano sent me was so slow that all we got were expired cookies. BEAST is just a baby, it deserves fresh cookies. I spent the last week or so working on that. As you see in the demo, BEAST now takes minutes to decrypt very long unexpired cookies.

In summary, we had an idea, and we've done several things we've never done before to make it work. That's our story of penetrating crypto. Thank you for your time.

**Thanks** to Marsh Ray and Juliano Rizzo for reading and editing drafts of this.

Er, I think you meant "streaming", not full-duplex. Basically you need to be able to force the browser to write part of a request on the wire, so you can observe the last cipherblock of that request, then you can choose the next block of plaintext and write it to the same request so it comes as the next block in the following message. There's nothing full-duplex about that :)

Yes. I agree, is not full-duplex or bidirectional or bisexual. Streaming is a better definition.

Hi Thai!

Very interesting to read about some of hacking you had to do to get this all working. I am going to get all my students to read this post - it will teach them about the importance of perseverance - and taking regular showers. Then they can help me review all those papers that are going to be coming my way :-)

Very nice find indeed! I did a small javascript demo of the chosen-bondary attack, that can be found here: http://erlend.oftedal.no/blog/beast/

Btw, sorry to see you have deleted your twitter account. Hope to see you back soon.

Love this story! I'm always wondering how people come up with attacks (seems like a lot of TLS ones come out of a simple comment in a discussion or note in a RFC), and also how do people collaborate on research.

Another thing I'm wondering is why the Silverlight, Java and websocket techniques when plain Ajax with javascript works? Are websockets faster somehow? If so, why aren't they used in more recent attacks like the 64-bit sweet32 one?

### About

Email: thaidn@gmail.com.
Tôi sinh ra ở Sài Gòn, lớn lên trên Internet. Tôi là kỹ sư an ninh mạng, từng được trao giải thưởng danh giá Pwnie Award.
Hiện tại tôi làm ở Google, với vai trò kỹ sư cấp hơi cao. Tôi từng là kỹ sư trưởng Google Tink, thư viện phần mềm mã hóa đạt được hơn ba triệu download mỗi tháng. Trong thời gian vừa qua tôi thấy hơi chán, chưa biết làm gì tiếp theo, nhưng tôi vẫn đang kiên trì lãnh lương hàng tháng.

I'm a security researcher, best known for my SSL attack trilogy: BEAST, CRIME, and POODLE. I was half of the team that discovered the crypto vulnerability in ASP.NET affecting millions of websites. For this work I was a recipient of the prestigious Pwnie Award. Currently I'm a senior member of the worldwide product security team at Google. My team built Project Wycheproof and Tink. My mission is to help everyone on the Internet use cryptography correctly.

1 Giới thiệu Tôi nhận được thư từ của nhiều bạn hỏi về việc nên học gì và như thế nào để có thể tìm được việc làm và làm được việc trong ngành an toàn thông tin (information security). An toàn thông tin là một ngành rộng lớn với rất nhiều lĩnh vực. Những gì tôi biết và làm được chỉ gói gọn trong một hai lĩnh vực. Có rất nhiều mảng kiến thức cơ bản mà tôi không nắm vững và cũng có nhiều kỹ năng mà tôi không thạo. Hack tài khoản Yahoo! Mail là một trong số đó. Tôi cũng không biết cách tìm địa chỉ IP của bạn chat :-(. Xét theo  năm mức ngu dốt  thì tôi nằm ở mức "1OI - thiếu kiến thức" ở hầu hết các lĩnh vực trong an toàn thông tin. Cũng có lĩnh vực tôi nằm ở mức "2OI - thiếu nhận thức". Nhiều lần đọc sách vở hoặc nói chuyện với đồng nghiệp, tôi hay nhận ra rằng có nhiều thứ tôi không biết là tôi không biết. Theo ý của anh Ngô Quang Hưng thì đây là chuyện bình thường: Dân máy tính thường phải đọc/học rất nhiều để theo kịp sự phát triển với tốc độ ánh sáng của ng...

Disclaimer: This post is solely my personal opinion, as someone from outside the team who consulted on security for Allo. Update: I erased a paragraph from this post because it's not cool to publicly discuss or to speculate the intent or future plans for the features of my employer's products, even if it's just my personal opinion. (I want to thank K.B. and Thiago Valverde for a lot of thoughtful discussions that help me understand what normal users really need when it comes to privacy) Unless you've been living under a rock this morning at the keynote of I/O 2016 Google announced a new messenger app called Allo . I'm not part of the Allo team, but I consult them on security, and in this post I want to share with you how I think about privacy and security in our new app. Allo offers two chat modes: normal and incognito. Normal is the default, but incognito can be activated with one touch. I want to stress that both modes encrypt chat messages when they are i...

I was hoping for a more official release of the document, but you will be able to find the document and the sample decrypt java code here **http://www.insecure.cl/Beast-SSL.rar** .

The paper is an interesting read. To me it outlined the weakness in using CBC very nicely and the attack is well described.  Certainly one of the more readable crypto papers I've come across. I will suggest you read it whilst well fed, and rested.

So is SSL/TLS dead?

The attack essentially implements a mini MITM attack using javascript delivered initially through a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. In a more traditional SSL MITM attack the application will terminate the SSL connection, present a new certificate and then establish a SSL connection to the originally requested site.  Because the certificate is selfsigned, it would typically throw up an error, allowing the user to notice that there is something going on. This attack works at a lower level.  The SSL connection isn't interrupted.  The weakness in using Cypher Block Chaining (CBC) is exploited to get access to the desired information. Whereas in the traditional MITM attack the user has a chance of noticing, with this attack they are unlikely to. As is outlined in the imperialviolet blog there are easier ways to attack. We do however need to keep this one in our minds.

How to fix it?

Well the easiest would be for web sites and browsers to stop using TLS v1.0, but as Rob points out in a previous diary http://isc.sans.edu/diary.html?storyid=11629 That may not be as easy as we think. The only other choice we have is to start disabling those ciphers that utilise CBC, but that may not work either as there are precious few cypher suites available that do not use CBC. Using stream ciphers will address the issue, but may introduce new ones (RC4 has its own weakness).

Chrome has already addressed the issue and the fix on the browser side is quite simple and elegant. We'll see the other browsers implement something similar over the next few weeks. That doesn't fix the protocol, but it will help address the immediate issue of clients being attacked in this manner.

If you do want to change the cipher defaults, in Windows world, you will need to make some registry changes.

HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL

This key and subkeys control how the ciphers are used.

This article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/245030 explains how to change protocols and weak cyphers (make sure you test in a test bed first).

As things develop, we will keep you posted.

### Comments

For those of us who can't control the client side - what's the consensus? Switch to RC4 on the server side? From what I've seen so far, BEAST doesn't seem to introduce a substantial incremental threat. If it's a MITM attack that requires XSS, there are already plenty of other attacks that you would already be vulnerable to. Is there something blatantly obvious that I'm missing?

It's an interesting find from a crypto perspective, and I'm sure it will be built upon - in its current state though, it doesn't seem like something that we need to be burning the midnight oil to patch for (even if a patch were available on the server side).

From what I understand from the document (in Beast-SSL.rar), two attacks are involved:

(1) Proof of (and possibly enhancements of) the known plain-text weakness in CBC;

(2) Demonstration of that weakness by making use of vulnerabilities in web browser and/or plugins that violate the "same-origin policy". Although this is an achievement and enables spectacular demonstrations, IMO it is not the most important issue at hand (this can and should be fixed anyway).

I think that web servers that provide mixed content (both http and https) put users at maximum risk - if those users communicate via a network an attacker has access to (open Wifi access points, compromised company network).

In such a case the attacker will be able to inject https requests with known plaintext in http data from the web server to the client, and subsequently crack the https data exchanged between client and server.

Please correct me if I'm wrong on this!

I realized that my posting seemed to ignore Mark's comment regarding RC4. Sorry, I got distracted and got away from that thought - my question was more along the lines of which was a lower threat, since there are issues with both.

When you say "RC4 has its own weakness" I'm guessing you are referring to that if the same key is re-used to encrypt with a stream cipher, you get zero security (the encryption can be cancelled out). However, that is not possible in SSL/TLS.

Microsoft Security Advisory (2588513) released yesterday 9-26-2011, a security update is in development. My guess is that XP/2003/Vista/2008 will not be given an update to add support for TLS 1.1/1.2 but I hope I am wrong.

## SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 allow chosen plaintext attack in CBC modes

#### Vulnerability Note VU#864643

Original Release Date: 2011-09-27 | Last Revised: 2011-12-08

---

### Overview

A vulnerability in the specification of the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols could allow an attacker to decrypt encrypted traffic.

### Description

| The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols are commonly used to provide authentication, encryption, integrity, and non-repudiation services to network application protocols such as HTTP, IMAP, POP3, LDAP, SMTP, and others. Several different versions of the SSL and TLS protocols have been standardized and are in widespread use. These protocols support the use of both block-based and stream-based ciphers.  A vulnerability in the way the SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 protocols select the initialization vector (IV) when operating in cipher-block chaining (CBC) modes allows an attacker to perform a chosen-plaintext attack on encrypted traffic. This vulnerability has been addressed in the specification for the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 protocols.While this vulnerability exists in the underlying specification of the affected protocols, a practical attack called BEAST has been demonstrated in the context of a web browser and the use of the HTTPS protocol. Because of the software functionality available to an attacker in this environment, it represents the most likely attack vector and the most significant risk for affected users. An effective BEAST attack appears to require a cross-domain vulnerability that allows the attacker to issue specially crafted HTTPS requests. A blog post by Thái Duong discusses "...a way to bypass the same-origin policy (SOP)..." using a Java applet. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle and to generate specially-crafted plaintext input could decrypt the contents of an SSL- or TLS-encrypted session. This could allow the attacker to recover potentially sensitive information (e.g., HTTP authentication cookies). |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Workarounds**Some vendors have published specific mitigation advice for the attacks related to this issues. Please see the Vendor Information section of this document for more information.The following general workarounds can be effective in mitigating this issue:     + Prioritize the use of the RC4 algorithm over block ciphers in server software  Note that this workaround is not feasible to implement on systems that require [FIPS-140](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips140-2/fips1402.pdf) compliance since RC4 is not a FIPS-approved cryptographic algorithm.    + Enable support for TLS 1.1 and/or TLS 1.2 in the web browser + Enable support for TLS 1.1 in server software  Note that both the web servers and the client web browser must support TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 for these workarounds to be effective. The session will fallback to an earlier version of the TLS or SSL protocol in the event that either is incompatible with TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2. |

### [Chrome and the BEAST](/2011/09/23/chromeandbeast.html) (23 Sep 2011)

Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo today demoed an attack against TLS 1.0's use of cipher block chaining (CBC) in a browser environment. The authors contacted browser vendors several months ago about this and so, in order not to preempt their demo, I haven't discussed any details until now.

Contrary to several press reports, Duong and Rizzo have not found, nor do they claim, any new flaws in TLS. They have shown a concrete proof of concept for a flaw in CBC that, sadly, has a long history. [Early reports of the problem](http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev%40openssl.org/msg10664.html) date back nearly ten years ago and Bard published [two](http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/111.pdf) [papers](http://eprint.iacr.org/2006/136.pdf) detailing the problem.

The problem has been fixed in TLS 1.1 and a workaround for SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 is known, so why is this still an issue?

The workaround (prepending empty application data records) is perfectly valid according to the protocol but several buggy implementations of SSL/TLS misbehaved when it was enabled. After Duong and Rizzo notified us, we put the same workaround back into Chrome to see if the state of the Internet had improved in the years since the last attempt. Sadly it was still infeasible to implement this workaround and the change had to be reverted.

Use of TLS 1.1 would also have solved the issue but, despite it being published in 2006, common SSL/TLS libraries still don't implement it. But even if there was widespread deployment of TLS 1.1, it wouldn't have helped avoid problems like this. Due to a different, common bug in SSL 3.0 implementations (nearly 12 years after SSL 3.0 was obsoleted by TLS 1.0), browsers still have to perform SSL 3.0 downgrades to support buggy servers. So even with a TLS 1.1 capable browser and server, an attacker can trigger a downgrade to SSL 3.0 and bypass the protections of TLS 1.1.

Finally, the CBC attacks were believed to be largely theoretical but, as Duong and Rizzo have pointed out today, that's no longer the case.

Initially the authors identified HTML5 WebSockets as a viable method of exploiting the CBC weakness but, due to unrelated reasons, the WebSockets protocol was already in the process of changing in such a way that stopped it. The new WebSockets protocol shipped with Chrome 14 but several plugins have been found to offer features that might allow the attack to be performed.

Duong and Rizzo confirmed that the Java plugin can be used, but Chrome already blocks the execution of Java by default. Other plugins, if installed, can be disabled on the about:plugins page if the user wishes.

The attack is still a difficult one; the attacker has to have high-bandwidth MITM access to the victim. This is typically achieved by being on the same wireless network as the victim. None the less, it's a much less serious issue than a problem which can be exploited by having the victim merely visit a webpage. (Incidentally, we pushed out a fix to all Chrome users for such a Flash bug only a few days ago.)

Also, an attacker with MITM abilities doesn't need to implement this complex attack. [SSL stripping](http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/) and [mixed-scripting](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/06/trying-to-end-mixed-scripting.html) issues are much easier to exploit and will take continued, [sustained](http://dev.chromium.org/sts) effort to address. Duong and Rizzo have highlighted this fact by choosing to attack one of the few HSTS sites.

Thanks to an idea suggested by Xuelei Fan, we have [another workaround](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome?view=rev&revision=97269) for the problem which will, hopefully, cause fewer incompatibility problems. This workaround is currently being tested on the Chrome dev and beta channels but we haven't pushed it on the stable channel yet. Since we don't really know if the fix will cause problems it's not something that we want to drop on people without testing. The benefit of a fix to Chrome's TLS stack is also limited as Chrome already uses the newer WebSockets protocol and it doesn't fix problems in plugins.

If it turns out that we've misjudged something we can quickly react, thanks to Chrome's auto-update mechanism.

It's also worth noting that Google's servers aren't vulnerable to this problem. In part due to CBC's history, Google servers have long preferred RC4, a cipher that doesn't involve CBC mode. Mention has also been made of Chrome's False Start feature but, since we don't believe that there are any vectors using Chrome's stack, that's immaterial.

# CVE-2012-1150

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2012-1149.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2012-1151.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2012-1150 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-1150)

#### Description

Python before 2.6.8, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, 3.x before 3.1.5, and 3.2.x before 3.2.3 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

Cox    2011-09-27 11:17:36 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat is aware of, and tracking, the Rizzo/Duong chosen plain text attack on SSL/TLS 1.0, also known as "BEAST". This issue has been assigned [CVE-2011-3389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3389). This attack uses web browser extensions to exploit a weakness in SSL/TLS cipher-block chaining (CBC), allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to recover certain session information, such as cookie data, from what should be a secure connection.  The research shows two ways that an attacker could mount an attack. In both cases the attacker needs access to the data stream from the web browser to the server while a user visits a malicious website using a browser. The attacker may then be able to determine a portion of the data the browser sends to the server by making a large number of requests over a period of time. This data could include information such as an authentication cookie.  The first method of attack involves using WebSockets. Currently, Red Hat does not ship any products that allow an attack using WebSockets to be successful. We are planning to update Firefox to version 7, which contains protections in the WebSocket code that prevents this particular attack from being effective.   The second method of attack involves using a malicious Java applet. In order for the attack to be successful, the attacker would need to circumvent the Same Origin Policy (SOP) controls in Java. The researchers claim to have found a flaw in the Java SOP and we will issue updates to correct this flaw as suitable fixes are available.  We are in contact with various upstream projects regarding this attack. As a precautionary measure, we plan to update the Network Security Services (NSS), GnuTLS, and OpenSSL packages as suitable fixes are available.  We will continue to track this issue and take any appropriate actions as needed.

For better compatibility with some SSL/TLS implementations, it does not use 0/n split, but 1/(n-1) split, as discussed in the Mozilla bug:  <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=665814#c89>  Even this approach is known to cause certain compatibility issues and hence its use can be controlled using newly introduced property jsse.enableCBCProtection.

It uses 1/(n-1) record splitting as mentioned in [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c19).  This mitigation was added in NSS version 3.13 (which is used in Firefox 9 and later) and is enabled by default upstream.  Environment variable NSS_SSL_CBC_RANDOM_IV can be used to disable the mitigation when it causes failures to connect to servers that are intolerant to such record splitting (see [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c23)).  Setting the environment variable value to 0 disables the mitigation.  The nss packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were updated to version 3.13.1 via RHBA-2012:0337:   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-0337.html>  Unlike upstream versions, this mitigation is disabled by default in nss packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (which is the reason why RHBA-2012:0337 is not a security erratum and does not claim to fix this issue) and current Fedora versions (up to and including Fedora 17).

This solution is still not widely usable, as TLS 1.1+ support and use is still limited.  OpenSSL and NSS versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 currently do not support TLS 1.1 or later.  Update: OpenSSL packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and NSS packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 now support TLS 1.1 and 1.2, see [comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c44) and [comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c45) below for details.  - Restrict the set of allowed cipher suites to only those that use stream cipher and are unaffected by this issue.  Cipher suites using RC4 are commonly supported by SSL/TLS implementations.  This may not be a usable workaround in environments where specific ciphers are required (such as AES).  It is possible to configure httpd's mod_ssl to prefer RC4 whenever client (browser) supports it, even when client prefers different cipher suite (the default behavior is to honor client's cipher suite preference and use the first one supported by both client and server).  Quoting example configuration from Qualys blog post (see [comment #30](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c30)):    SSLHonorCipherOrder On   SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL  Refer to httpd documentation for detailed description of these configuration options:  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslhonorcipherorder> <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslciphersuite>  Note that the above setting may still allow the use of block cipher when client does not support RC4-SHA.  Only specifying single "SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA" will require RC4, and will not establish connection with clients that do not implement it.  Also note that the SSLHonorCipherOrder configuration option is not available in the httpd version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  Update: The use of RC4 as preferred cipher is no longer encouraged, as attacks against this cipher were discovered, see [bug 921947](show_bug.cgi?id=921947 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2566 SSL/TLS: Attack against RC4 stream cipher") for details.  - Record splitting (either 0/n or 1/(n-1)).  Such mitigation is implemented in both OpenSSL and NSS, but is not enabled by default due to known issues (see [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c23)).  This mitigation only protects one direction of the SSL/TLS communication (form the peer that implements the mitigation).  It is enabled by default in the default web browser shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (see [comment #36](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c36)), protecting the browser -> web server communication that was targeted by this attack.  Enabling this mitigation on the server side will not protect communication from a browser.  Update: This mitigation was implemented in most major web browsers and is considered sufficient protection against BEAST attack in environments where TLS 1.1 or later can not be used.  The following blog post describes that Qualys' SSL Server Test no longer lowers score based on lack of server-side BEAST mitigatons:  <https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/09/10/is-beast-still-a-threat>   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c38)  Rui Miguel Seabra    2013-03-15 09:22:01 UTC  ``` URGENT: The mitigation for OpenSSL is no longer valid, it's been proven insecure  * Technical details by (the) Dan J.

Hi Rui,  This is a different flaw, it concerns RC4.   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c40)  Rui Miguel Seabra    2013-03-15 12:01:24 UTC  ``` Yes, but RC4 is the mitigation for beast with OpenSSL. Please read [comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c37).   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c41)  Stephen    2013-04-03 20:19:30 UTC  ``` I recently read that "the BEAST attack is not feasible today."  Does this argument hold any water?  See: <https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk86440>  Which states:  For the BEAST attack to succeed all of the following conditions must hold:  - SSLv3 or TLS 1.0 must be used. - A block cipher must be used. - The empty fragment mitigation must not be used. Many browsers, including   IE and Chrome have it now. - The attacker must be able to both run an agent on the browser, and to   monitor outgoing traffic. - The attacker must find a way to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP) on   the browser, because the browser is not supposed to allow an attacker's   agent (whether implemented in Java, Javascript, Flash or Silverlight) to   send requests to another server.  The BEAST attack used a bug in the Java virtual machine implemented in some browsers, where the SOP was not enforced. This bug in Java has been fixed and all reasonably updated clients are not vulnerable. Similarly, all clients that have the empty fragment mitigation are not vulnerable either. In additional all other browser bugs mentioned in this CVE (e.g. WebSocket API) were fixed.  Therefore, the BEAST attack is not feasible today.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c43)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-23 16:59:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.4  Via RHSA-2013:1455 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1455.html>   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c44)  Huzaifa S.

#### Paper 2004/111

### The Vulnerability of SSL to Chosen Plaintext Attack

Gregory V. Bard

##### Abstract

The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol is widely used for securing communication over the Internet. When utilizing block ciphers for encryption, the SSL standard mandates the use of the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of encryption which requires an initialization vector (IV) in order to encrypt. Although the initial IV used by SSL is a (pseudo)random string which is generated and shared during the initial handshake phase, subsequent IVs used by SSL are chosen in a deterministic, predictable pattern; in particular, the IV of a message is taken to be the final ciphertext block of the immediately-preceding message. We show that this introduces a vulnerability in SSL which (potentially) enables easy recovery of low-entropy strings such as passwords or PINs that have been encrypted. Moreover, we argue that the open nature of web browsers provides a feasible ``point of entry'' for this attack via a corrupted plug-in; thus, implementing the attack is likely to be much easier than, say, installing a Trojan Horse for ``keyboard sniffing''. Finally, we suggest a number of modifications to the SSL standard which will prevent this attack.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict network access to the device to the extent possible

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2011-3389

The SSL protocol encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary
attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses e.g. the HTML5
WebSocket API, the Java URLConnection API, or the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a “BEAST” attack.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality of the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2016-6329

TLS, when used with a 64-bit block cipher, could allow remote attackers to obtain cleartext data by
leveraging a birthday attack against a long-duration encrypted session, aka a “Sweet32” attack.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality of the device.

Vulnerability CVE-2013-0169

TLS and DTLS versions 1.1 and 1.2, as used in the affected product, do not properly consider timing
side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding,
which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via
statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the “Lucky Thirteen” issue.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected systems.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality of the device.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2016-001

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | BEAST vulnerability in HTTP server |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Unauthorized data disclosure due to man-in-the-middle attack |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote unauthenticated sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | Yes |
| **Reported On** | 04/15/15 |
| **Reported By** | Alex A. Welzl |
| **Posted On** | 02/03/16 |
| **Last Updated On** | February 15, 2016 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Joshua Colp <jcolp AT digium DOT com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2011-3389 |

| **Description** | The Asterisk HTTP server currently has a default configuration which allows the BEAST vulnerability to be exploited if the TLS functionality is enabled. This can allow a man-in-the-middle attack to decrypt data passing through it. |

| **Resolution** | Additional configuration options have been added to Asterisk which allow configuration of the HTTP server to not be susceptible to the BEAST vulnerability. These include options to confirm the permitted ciphers, to control what TLS protocols are allowed, and to use server cipher preference order instead of client preference order. The default configuration has also been changed for the HTTP server to use a configuration which is not susceptible to the BEAST vulnerability. |

| **Affected Versions** | | |
| **Product** | **Release Series** |  |
| Asterisk Open Source | 1.8.x | All Versions |
| Asterisk Open Source | 11.x | All Versions |

| Certified Asterisk | 1.8.28 | All Versions |
| Certified Asterisk | 11.6 | All Versions |

Cox    2011-09-27 11:17:36 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat is aware of, and tracking, the Rizzo/Duong chosen plain text attack on SSL/TLS 1.0, also known as "BEAST". This issue has been assigned [CVE-2011-3389](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3389). This attack uses web browser extensions to exploit a weakness in SSL/TLS cipher-block chaining (CBC), allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to recover certain session information, such as cookie data, from what should be a secure connection.  The research shows two ways that an attacker could mount an attack. In both cases the attacker needs access to the data stream from the web browser to the server while a user visits a malicious website using a browser. The attacker may then be able to determine a portion of the data the browser sends to the server by making a large number of requests over a period of time. This data could include information such as an authentication cookie.  The first method of attack involves using WebSockets. Currently, Red Hat does not ship any products that allow an attack using WebSockets to be successful. We are planning to update Firefox to version 7, which contains protections in the WebSocket code that prevents this particular attack from being effective.   The second method of attack involves using a malicious Java applet. In order for the attack to be successful, the attacker would need to circumvent the Same Origin Policy (SOP) controls in Java. The researchers claim to have found a flaw in the Java SOP and we will issue updates to correct this flaw as suitable fixes are available.  We are in contact with various upstream projects regarding this attack. As a precautionary measure, we plan to update the Network Security Services (NSS), GnuTLS, and OpenSSL packages as suitable fixes are available.  We will continue to track this issue and take any appropriate actions as needed.

It uses 1/(n-1) record splitting as mentioned in [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c19).  This mitigation was added in NSS version 3.13 (which is used in Firefox 9 and later) and is enabled by default upstream.  Environment variable NSS_SSL_CBC_RANDOM_IV can be used to disable the mitigation when it causes failures to connect to servers that are intolerant to such record splitting (see [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c23)).  Setting the environment variable value to 0 disables the mitigation.  The nss packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 were updated to version 3.13.1 via RHBA-2012:0337:   <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2012-0337.html>  Unlike upstream versions, this mitigation is disabled by default in nss packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 (which is the reason why RHBA-2012:0337 is not a security erratum and does not claim to fix this issue) and current Fedora versions (up to and including Fedora 17).

This mitigation is enabled by default in Firefox and Thunderbird packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 starting with updates in RHSA-2012:1088 and RHSA-2012:1089:  <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1088.html> <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1089.html>   ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c37)  Tomas Hoger    2012-11-13 13:30:34 UTC  ``` Quick summary of mitigation options for this issue:  - Disable support for TLS 1.0 and older, require TLS 1.1 or later.  This solution is still not widely usable, as TLS 1.1+ support and use is still limited.  OpenSSL and NSS versions in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 currently do not support TLS 1.1 or later.  Update: OpenSSL packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and NSS packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 now support TLS 1.1 and 1.2, see [comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c44) and [comment 45](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c45) below for details.  - Restrict the set of allowed cipher suites to only those that use stream cipher and are unaffected by this issue.  Cipher suites using RC4 are commonly supported by SSL/TLS implementations.  This may not be a usable workaround in environments where specific ciphers are required (such as AES).  It is possible to configure httpd's mod_ssl to prefer RC4 whenever client (browser) supports it, even when client prefers different cipher suite (the default behavior is to honor client's cipher suite preference and use the first one supported by both client and server).  Quoting example configuration from Qualys blog post (see [comment #30](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c30)):    SSLHonorCipherOrder On   SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA:HIGH:!aNULL  Refer to httpd documentation for detailed description of these configuration options:  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslhonorcipherorder> <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslciphersuite>  Note that the above setting may still allow the use of block cipher when client does not support RC4-SHA.  Only specifying single "SSLCipherSuite RC4-SHA" will require RC4, and will not establish connection with clients that do not implement it.  Also note that the SSLHonorCipherOrder configuration option is not available in the httpd version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  Update: The use of RC4 as preferred cipher is no longer encouraged, as attacks against this cipher were discovered, see [bug 921947](show_bug.cgi?id=921947 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2013-2566 SSL/TLS: Attack against RC4 stream cipher") for details.  - Record splitting (either 0/n or 1/(n-1)).  Such mitigation is implemented in both OpenSSL and NSS, but is not enabled by default due to known issues (see [comment #23](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c23)).  This mitigation only protects one direction of the SSL/TLS communication (form the peer that implements the mitigation).  It is enabled by default in the default web browser shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (see [comment #36](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c36)), protecting the browser -> web server communication that was targeted by this attack.  Enabling this mitigation on the server side will not protect communication from a browser.  Update: This mitigation was implemented in most major web browsers and is considered sufficient protection against BEAST attack in environments where TLS 1.1 or later can not be used.  The following blog post describes that Qualys' SSL Server Test no longer lowers score based on lack of server-side BEAST mitigatons:  <https://community.qualys.com/blogs/securitylabs/2013/09/10/is-beast-still-a-threat>   ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c38)  Rui Miguel Seabra    2013-03-15 09:22:01 UTC  ``` URGENT: The mitigation for OpenSSL is no longer valid, it's been proven insecure  * Technical details by (the) Dan J.

Hi Rui,  This is a different flaw, it concerns RC4.   ```  [Comment 40](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c40)  Rui Miguel Seabra    2013-03-15 12:01:24 UTC  ``` Yes, but RC4 is the mitigation for beast with OpenSSL. Please read [comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c37).   ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c41)  Stephen    2013-04-03 20:19:30 UTC  ``` I recently read that "the BEAST attack is not feasible today."  Does this argument hold any water?  See: <https://supportcenter.checkpoint.com/supportcenter/portal?eventSubmit_doGoviewsolutiondetails=&solutionid=sk86440>  Which states:  For the BEAST attack to succeed all of the following conditions must hold:  - SSLv3 or TLS 1.0 must be used. - A block cipher must be used. - The empty fragment mitigation must not be used. Many browsers, including   IE and Chrome have it now. - The attacker must be able to both run an agent on the browser, and to   monitor outgoing traffic. - The attacker must find a way to bypass the Same Origin Policy (SOP) on   the browser, because the browser is not supposed to allow an attacker's   agent (whether implemented in Java, Javascript, Flash or Silverlight) to   send requests to another server.  The BEAST attack used a bug in the Java virtual machine implemented in some browsers, where the SOP was not enforced. This bug in Java has been fixed and all reasonably updated clients are not vulnerable. Similarly, all clients that have the empty fragment mitigation are not vulnerable either. In additional all other browser bugs mentioned in this CVE (e.g. WebSocket API) were fixed.  Therefore, the BEAST attack is not feasible today.   ```  [Comment 43](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c43)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-10-23 16:59:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.4  Via RHSA-2013:1455 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-1455.html>   ```  [Comment 44](show_bug.cgi?id=737506#c44)  Huzaifa S.

# Attack against TLS-protected communications

Shannon Prior
September 27, 2011

[6 responses](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2011/09/27/attack-against-tls-protected-communications/#comments)

*UPDATE 10.18.11: Today, Oracle is releasing a patch update to Java SE to address [this vulnerability](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpuoct2011-443431.html).  We recommend that users update their Java plugin to ensure that they have the latest and most secure fixes.  Windows users on auto update should start seeing the updates as early as this week.  Users can also manually download the update here: [http://java.com](http://java.com/).  Apple distributes Java updates directly for OS X.  We will not be [blocking](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Blocklisting) vulnerable versions of Java at this time, though we will continue to monitor for incidents of this vulnerability being exploited in the wild.*

Issue

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong recently presented a paper detailing an information stealing attack against TLS-protected communications.  The attack is not Firefox specific, and Firefox is not vulnerable in default configurations, however some plugins may be.

Impact to users

A successful application of this man-in-the-middle attack would allow an attacker to steal information from encrypted communications. This could include cookie data, which may allow the attacker to impersonate the victim.

Status

Firefox itself is not vulnerable to this attack. While Firefox does use TLS 1.0 (the version of TLS with this weakness), the [technical details](http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/09/23/chromeandbeast.html) of the attack require the ability to completely control the content of connections originating in the browser which Firefox does not allow.

The attackers have, however, found weaknesses in Java plugins that permit this attack. We recommend that users [disable Java](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Using%20plugins%20with%20Firefox?s=plugin&r=2&as=s#w_managing-plugins) from the Firefox Add-ons Manager as a precaution. We are currently evaluating the feasibility of disabling Java universally in Firefox installs and will update this post if we do so.

Credit

This bug was reported by Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong.

Our “endorsement of security”(?) is only that we don’t believe there are other avenues of attack using a browser alone. As mentioned in my previous comment we’re testing a fix to TLS 1.0 that will stop them all even if we missed any. This fix breaks communication with a small percentage of servers (current estimate roughly one in a thousand) so we’re proceeding carefully.

There are other plugins that have similar features that might be capable of being abused; we don’t know. We’re certainly NOT assuming sites serve only safe advertisements. But more importantly, the BEAST only works because the attacker is able to perform a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the user. It doesn’t matter HOW safe a website is, the MITM simply serves you the content they want unless the site is using TLS. If you browse to a single site that makes a single non-TLS request then the attacker can use that to launch the attack.

    > Why aren’t you advising people use noscript to block all java except from organization deployments using the java plugin? Don’t you think it would work? We would really like a way to have our organizational “enterprise” applets to be able to be deployed in firefox as we have done for years. (Note: organizations that are NOT part of IBM or Oracle or other corporate enterprise vendors run technologies from those enterprise vendors. Please try not to know the lowly customers out with the enterprise bathwater 🙂
    >
    > Related suggestion: why not have firefox have an option for people to see calls to a plugin. (and possibility to approve them or not?) In the case of java it would be very good to know how websites are calling java, especially if they are using the java webstart/jnlp approach. Java web start has major rights to mess with the client. I’d really like to know how we are being attacked, from what kind of code it is launched.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems.

# cURL: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in cURL, the worst of
which might allow remote execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-misc/curl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **7.24.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **7.24.0** |

### Background

cURL is a command line tool for transferring files with URL syntax,
supporting numerous protocols.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in cURL:

* When zlib is enabled, the amount of data sent to an application for
  automatic decompression is not restricted (CVE-2010-0734).
* When performing GSSAPI authentication, credential delegation is
  always used (CVE-2011-2192).
* When SSL is enabled, cURL improperly disables the OpenSSL workaround
  to mitigate an information disclosure vulnerability in the SSL and TLS
  protocols (CVE-2011-3389).
* libcurl does not properly verify file paths for escape control
  characters in IMAP, POP3 or SMTP URLs (CVE-2012-0036).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user or automated process to open a
specially crafted file or URL using cURL, possibly resulting in the
remote execution of arbitrary code, a Denial of Service condition,
disclosure of sensitive information, or unwanted actions performed via
the IMAP, POP3 or SMTP protocols. Furthermore, remote servers may be able
to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All cURL users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-misc/curl-7.24.0"

```

Source: Hewlett-Packard Company, HP Software Security Response Team

VULNERABILITY SUMMARY
A potential security vulnerability has been identified with HP System Management \
Homepage (SMH) for Linux and Windows. The vulnerability could be exploited remotely \
resulting in unauthorized disclosure of information.

References: CVE-2011-3389, CERT VU#864643

===========================================================
  Reference              Base Vector             Base Score
CVE-2011-3389    (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N)       4.3
===========================================================
             Information on CVSS is documented
            in HP Customer Notice: HPSN-2008-002

RESOLUTION

CERT VU#864643 documents workarounds.

Prioritize RC4 Ciphers over CBC Ciphers

The vulnerability can be worked around by prioritizing RC4 ciphers over CBC ciphers.

By default SMH already does prioritize the RC4 ciphers over CBC ciphers. The default \
configuration is:

'ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:!EXPORT40:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:-SSLv2:+EXP:-LOW:+eNULL'

The list of available ciphers in SMH can be further restricted. The following command \
specifies only one cipher:

smhconfig -Z 'RC4-SHA.

After issuing the command, the SMH service must be restarted to make the change \
effective. The change should be tested with the browser.

Update the Browser

Certain browsers have implemented a protocol change to work around the vulnerability. \
CERT VU#864643 lists some of those browsers.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-099 - Important

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2618444)

Published: December 13, 2011 | Updated: January 10, 2012

**Version:** 1.2

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The most severe vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user opens a legitimate HyperText Markup Language (HTML) file that is located in the same directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file.

This security update is rated Important for Internet Explorer 7, Internet Explorer 8, and Internet Explorer 9 on Windows clients and for Internet Explorer 9 for Windows Server 2008 R2. This security update is also rated Moderate for Internet Explorer 6 on all supported editions of Windows XP. This security update is also rated Low for Internet Explorer on Windows servers (except Windows Server 2008 R2). For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the behavior of Internet Explorer XSS Filter, correcting the manner in which Internet Explorer loads external libraries, and correcting the way that Internet Explorer enforces the content settings supplied by the Web server. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2618444](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2618444) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected.

## XSS Filter Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1992

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page that contains malicious JavaScript code. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1992](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1992).

#### Mitigating Factors for XSS Filter Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1992

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.
* Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 9 are not affected by this vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for XSS Filter Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1992

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Disable XSS** **Filter**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  1. Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as **Disable\_XSS\_Filter.reg**:

     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\MAIN\FeatureControl\FEATURE_XSSFILTER]"iexplorer.exe"=dword:00000001

     ```
  2. Run **Enable\_XSS\_Filter.reg** with the following command from an elevated command prompt:

     ```
     Regedit.exe /s Enable_XSS_Filter.reg

     ```

#### FAQ for XSS Filter Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1992

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability when a user views a Web page could view content from the local computer or a browser window in a domain or Internet Explorer zone other than the domain or zone of the attacker's Web page.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The Internet Explore XSS Filter incorrectly allows attackers to read content from different domains through trial and error attacks.

**What is the Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Filter?**

Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 include a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 and later versions for the Internet Zone.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could view content from another domain or Internet Explorer zone.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content designed to exploit this vulnerability by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user visit a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

## Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2019

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-2019](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-2019).

#### Mitigating Factors for Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2019

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2019

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block the loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
* **Disable the** **WebClient** **service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-2019

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer does not properly restrict the path used for loading external libraries.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate HyperText Markup Language (HTML) file that is located in the same directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. By default, Internet Explorer only considers the desktop to be the current directory. In order for this attack to be successful, an attacker would need the user to place both the HTML file and the specially crafted DLL on the user's desktop. An attacker would have to convince a user to change the PATH environment variable in order to exploit this issue through a UNC or WebDAV location.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate HTML file and specially crafted DLL attachments to a user, and convincing the user to place the files on the desktop and to open the HTML file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could convince a user to download and save a legitimate HTML file and specially crafted DLL on to the desktop and convince the user to open the legitimate HTML file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. This vulnerability could not be exploited by simply browsing to a Web page, user interaction is required.

In a network attack scenario, an attacker could place a legitimate HTML file and a specially crafted DLL on a network share, such as a UNC or WebDAV location. The attacker would then have to convince the user to change the PATH environment variable to include this network share, UNC, or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the HTML file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file found on the search path and execute any code it contained.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability mainly affects workstations where users may be expected to open attachments from untrusted network locations. Servers could also be at risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Internet Explorer loads external libraries.

**Is this vulnerability related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Yes, this vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), that affects how applications load external libraries. This security update addresses a particular instance of this type of vulnerability.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Content-Disposition Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3404

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Internet Explorer that could allow an attacker to force the browser to perform unexpected actions when a user downloads Web content, allowing an attacker to view content from a different domain or Internet Explorer zone other than the domain or zone of the attacker's Web page.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3404](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3404).

#### Mitigating Factors for Content-Disposition Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3404

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone. The Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section for this vulnerability for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Content-Disposition Information Disclosure Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3404

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Read e-mails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Outlook 2003, Microsoft Outlook 2007, and Microsoft Outlook 2010 provide an option for reading e-mail messages in plain text format. For more information about the **Read all standard mail in plain text** option, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 831607](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/831607).

  Microsoft Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

**Update Compatibility Evaluator and Application Compatibility Toolkit**

Updates often write to the same files and registry settings required for your applications to run. This can trigger incompatibilities and increase the time it takes to deploy security updates. You can streamline testing and validating Windows updates against installed applications with the [Update Compatibility Evaluator](https://technet.microsoft.com/windowsvista/en/library/4279e239-37a4-44aa-aec5-4e70fe39f9de) components included with [Application Compatibility Toolkit](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=24da89e9-b581-47b0-b45e-492dd6da2971&displaylang;=en).

The Application Compatibility Toolkit (ACT) contains the necessary tools and documentation to evaluate and mitigate application compatibility issues before deploying Microsoft Windows Vista, a Windows Update, a Microsoft Security Update, or a new version of Windows Internet Explorer in your environment.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

Although Chrome is not directly affected by the attack, the NSS network library was updated to include a defense against so-called BEAST. This defense may expose bugs in Brocade hardware. Brocade is working on the issue. The lighttpd project fixed a compatibility issue at version 1.4.27 and newer.

In addition, we would like to thank Sławomir Błażek and Aki Helin of OUSPG for working with us in the development cycle and preventing bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. Various rewards were issued.

#### Paper 2006/136

### A Challenging but Feasible Blockwise-Adaptive Chosen-Plaintext Attack on SSL

Gregory V. Bard

##### Abstract

This paper introduces a chosen-plaintext vulnerability in the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) and Trasport Layer Security (TLS) protocols which
enables recovery of low entropy strings such as can be guessed from a
likely set of 2--1000 options. SSL and TLS are widely used for
securing communication over the Internet. When utilizing block ciphers
for encryption, the SSL and TLS standards mandate the use of the
cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of encryption which requires an
initialization vector (IV) in order to encrypt. Although the first IV
used by SSL is a (pseudo)random string which is generated and shared
during the initial handshake phase, subsequent IVs used by SSL are
chosen in a deterministic, predictable pattern; in particular, the IV
of a message is taken to be the final ciphertext block of the
immediately-preceding message, and is therefore known to the adversary.
The one-channel nature of web proxies, anonymizers or Virtual Private
Networks (VPNs), results in all Internet traffic from one machine
traveling over the same SSL channel. We show this provides a feasible
``point of entry'' for this attack. Moreover, we show that the
location of target data among block boundaries can have a profound
impact on the number of guesses required to recover that data,
especially in the low-entropy case.
The attack in this paper is an application of the blockwise-adaptive
chosen-plaintext attack paradigm, and is the only feasible attack to
use this paradigm with a reasonable probability of success. The
attack will work for all versions of SSL, and TLS version 1.0. This
vulnerability and others are closed in TLS 1.1 (which is still in
draft status) and OpenSSL after 0.9.6d. It is hoped this paper will
encourage the deprecation of SSL and speed the adoption of OpenSSL
or TLS 1.1/1.2 when they are finially released.

**Note:** Changes relating to the directions of traffic of the adversary and target. Also some formatting changes.

# CVE-2011-3389

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2011-3388.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2011-3415.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2011-3389 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3389)

#### Description

The SSL protocol, as used in certain configurations in Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and other products, encrypts data by using CBC mode with chained initialization vectors, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers via a blockwise chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session, in conjunction with JavaScript code that uses (1) the HTML5 WebSocket API, (2) the Java URLConnection API, or (3) the Silverlight WebClient API, aka a "BEAST" attack.

#### Note from the SUSE Security Team

This option is currently not yet fixed in openssl itself by default, as it would break some clients and servers. So far every openssl using library or program needs to enable the workaround by itself, by removing the SSL\_OP\_DONT\_INSERT\_EMPTY\_FRAGMENTS from the options passed to the SSL initialization.SUSE Bugzilla entries: [716002](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=716002) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [719047](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=719047) [VERIFIED / WONTFIX], [725167](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=725167) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [726096](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=726096) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [739248](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739248) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [739256](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739256) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [742306](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=742306) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [751718](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=751718) [RESOLVED / FIXED], [759666](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=759666) [CLOSED / FIXED], [763598](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=763598) [NEW], [814655](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=814655) [RESOLVED / FIXED]

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Details

Deepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP)

implementation in the IcedTea web browser plugin. This could allow a

remote attacker to open connections to certain hosts that should

not be permitted. ([CVE-2011-3377](/security/CVE-2011-3377))

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES

encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable to

a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to view

confidential data. ([CVE-2011-3389](/security/CVE-2011-3389))

It was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in

the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A

remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application

or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious

input. ([CVE-2011-3521](/security/CVE-2011-3521))

It was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform

SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause

an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with

the full privileges of the JVM. ([CVE-2011-3544](/security/CVE-2011-3544))

It was discovered that the InputStream class used a global buffer to

store input bytes skipped. An attacker could possibly use this to gain

access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-3547](/security/CVE-2011-3547))

It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the AWTKeyStroke

class. A remote attacker could cause an untrusted application or applet

to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3548](/security/CVE-2011-3548))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed

in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote

attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application

or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3551](/security/CVE-2011-3551))

It was discovered that the default number of available UDP sockets for

applications running under SecurityManager restrictions was set too

high. A remote attacker could use this with a malicious application or

applet exhaust the number of available UDP sockets to cause a denial

of service for other applets or applications running within the same

JVM. ([CVE-2011-3552](/security/CVE-2011-3552))

It was discovered that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) could

incorrectly expose a stack trace. A remote attacker could potentially

use this to gain access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-3553](/security/CVE-2011-3553))

It was discovered that the unpacker for pack200 JAR files did not

sufficiently check for errors. An attacker could cause a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted

pack200 JAR file. ([CVE-2011-3554](/security/CVE-2011-3554))

It was discovered that the RMI registration implementation did not

properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code. A remote

attacker could use this to execute code with elevated privileges.

([CVE-2011-3556](/security/CVE-2011-3556), [CVE-2011-3557](/security/CVE-2011-3557))

It was discovered that the HotSpot VM could be made to crash, allowing

an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive

information. ([CVE-2011-3558](/security/CVE-2011-3558))

It was discovered that the HttpsURLConnection class did not

properly perform SecurityManager checks in certain situations. This

could allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions on HTTPS

connections. ([CVE-2011-3560](/security/CVE-2011-3560))

## MITIGATION

Philips will release an updated version of the ISP in the coming months that will address these vulnerabilities. Additionally, Philips’ evaluation of Operating System security patches is ongoing, and after appropriate testing , the patches and mitigating controls are posted on Philips’ InCenter. ISP users are recommended to obtain available mitigating controls by accessing their InCenter account at this location:

<http://incenter.medical.philips.com>

Users with questions regarding their specific ISP installations are advised by Philips to contact their local Philips service support team or their regional service support.

Philips’ contact information is available at the following location:

<https://www.usa.philips.com/healthcare/solutions/customer-service-solutions>

Please see the Philips product security website for the latest security information for Philips products:

<https://www.philips.com/productsecurity>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate all medical devices and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available in the NCCIC Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B), that is available for download from the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

## SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 encryption protocols. This vulnerability affects the protocol itself and is not specific to the Windows operating system. This is an information disclosure vulnerability that allows the decryption of encrypted SSL/TLS traffic. This vulnerability primarily impacts HTTPS traffic, since the browser is the primary attack vector, and all web traffic served via HTTPS or mixed content HTTP/HTTPS is affected.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3389](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3389).

#### Mitigating Factors for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, and all cipher suites that do not use CBC mode are not affected.

#### Workarounds for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Prioritize the RC4 Algorithm in server software on systems running Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, or Windows Server 2008 R2**

  The attack only affects cipher suites that use symmetric encryption algorithms in CBC mode, such as AES, and does not affect the RC4 algorithm. You can prioritize the RC4 algorithm in server software in order to facilitate secure communication using RC4 instead of CBC. Refer to this MSDN article, [Prioritizing Schannel Cipher Suites](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb870930%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx), to learn how to perform this operation.

  **Warning** The client or server with which you are communicating must support the RC4 algorithm. If support for RC4 is not available, a different cipher suite will be used if one is available, and this workaround will be ineffective.
* **Enable TLS 1.1 and/or 1.2 in client software on systems running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2**

  You can enable a different version of the TLS protocol that is not affected by this vulnerability. You can do this by modifying the Advanced Security settings of Internet Explorer.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2643584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2643584) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround for TLS 1.1.

  **Interactive Method**

  To change the default protocol version to be used for HTTPS requests, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Advanced** tab.
  3. In the **Security** category, select the **Use TLS 1.1** and/or **Use TLS 1.2** checkboxes.
  4. Click **OK**.
  5. Exit and restart Internet Explorer.

  **Warning** Web servers that donât support TLS 1.1 or 1.2 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround.

  **Managed Deployment Method (Enable TLS 1.1 and disable SSLv2)**

  Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Disable\_SSLv2.reg:

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ```
  ```
  [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]
  "SecureProtocols"=dword:00000200

  ```

  You can apply this .reg file to individual systems by double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains by using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

  **Warning** Web servers that donât support TLS 1.1 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround.
* **Enable TLS 1.1 in server software on systems running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2**

  You can enable TLS 1.1, which is not affected by the vulnerability.

  See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2643584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2643584) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround for TLS 1.1.

  **Warning** Web clients that donât support TLS 1.1 will perform the SSL negotiation with lower SSL/TLS versions, voiding the workaround.

  **Managed Deployment Method (Enable TLS 1.1)**

  Save the following to a file with a .REG extension, such as Enable\_TLSv11.reg:

  ```
  Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

  ```
  ```
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL\Protocols\TLS 1.1\Client]"
  DisabledByDefault"=dword:00000000

#### FAQ for SSL and TLS Protocols Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3389

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who exploited the vulnerability could decrypt portions of encrypted traffic and retrieve information such as authentication cookies.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by a design flaw in the SSL and TLS protocols when Cipher-block chaining (CBC) mode of operation is used.

**What are TLS and SSL?**

The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Handshake Protocol is responsible for the authentication and key exchange necessary to establish or resume secure sessions. The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a predecessor of the Transport Layer Security protocol. Both TLS and SSL perform the same functions and support secure network communications using a combination of public and secret key technology.

For more information, see the TechNet article, [How TLS/SSL works](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc783349%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker monitoring an encrypted communication who successfully exploited this vulnerability could decrypt the intercepted encrypted traffic.

**How could an attacker exploit the** **vulnerability?**

An attacker could inject malicious code in an HTTP response or host a specially crafted website containing malicious code, forcing the browser to execute this malicious code. This code sends several requests, inside the same TLS/SSL session, to a third party HTTPS website, where cookies are sent automatically if a previous authenticated session exists. This is a required condition in order to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to intercept this HTTPS traffic in order to exploit this vulnerability in SSL, resulting in the possibility to decrypt portions of the encrypted traffic (for example, authentication cookies).

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Since the browser is the primary attack vector, any systems, such as workstations or terminal servers, that send and receive HTTPS traffic are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that the Windows Secure Channel (SChannel) component sends and receives encrypted network packets. This addresses the vulnerability affecting WinHTTP and provides the possibility to enable the protection system-wide. However, in order to be protected from the web-based attack vector through Internet Explorer for this vulnerability, customers must install both this update, MS12-006, and the [Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=232505) (2618444), MS11-099.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-3389](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3389).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had seen examples of proof of concept code published publicly but had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

# About the security content of Apple TV Software Update 4.4

This document describes the security content of Apple TV Software Update 4.4.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see " [Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222).

#### Apple TV Software Update 4.4

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other authorities, are not trusted.

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve

  Description: Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses. Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509 certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root certificate.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3427

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection

  Description: Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some information about the previous data. If the same connection was attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3389

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may result in an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A buffer overflow existed in libTIFF's handling of CCITT Group 4 encoded TIFF images.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-0192 : Apple

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: Viewing a maliciously crafted TIFF image may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A heap buffer overflow existed in ImageIO's handling of CCITT Group 4 encoded TIFF images.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-0241 : Cyril CATTIAUX of Tessi Technologies

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: A remote attacker may cause a device reset

  Description: The kernel failed to promptly reclaim memory from incomplete TCP connections. An attacker with the ability to connect to a listening service on an iOS device could exhaust system resources.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3259 : Wouter van der Veer of Topicus I&I, and Josh Enders

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may cause an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A one-byte heap buffer overflow existed in libxml's handling of XML data.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-0216 : Billy Rios of the Google Security Team

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may cause an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: A memory corruption issue existed in JavaScriptCore.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3232 : Aki Helin of OUSPG
