Quote from the [original vulnerability report](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Sep/158):

> [Time-line]

> 20/08/2011 - Vendor notified
> 02/09/2011 - No e-mail reply and BAN on Forum
> ???        - Vendor patch release
> 16/09/2011 - Public disclosure

Please tell me this is not true!

P.S.: You should also mention that people should definitely upgrade to keep their members and other internet users secure!

I have not received any emails about this vulnerability. At the forum there were no reports of this vulnerability and banned only spammers.

#### Re: PunBB 1.3.6

Thanks , but how I install this new version from 1.3.5 , like this ??

```
How to upgrade

    make a backup of the database and files;

    turn the Maintenance mode on (via admin panel);

    overwrite old files with new ones;

    after owerwriting, verify that the cache, img/avatars and extensions (for pun_repository) directories have enough write permissions (usually 777);

    clear cache directory;

    go to the forum index and run db_update.php script;

    turn the Maintenance mode off.
```

Thanks!!

You should probably read the OP at the top of the thread, where it says:

**This is a critical update. We strongly recommend that you update your forum!**
