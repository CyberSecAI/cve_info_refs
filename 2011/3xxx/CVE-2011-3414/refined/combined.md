**oCERT-2011-003 multiple implementations denial-of-service via hash algorithm collision**

**Description**:

A variety of programming languages suffer from a denial-of-service (DoS)
condition against storage functions of key/value pairs in hash data structures,
the condition can be leveraged by exploiting predictable collisions in the
underlying hashing algorithms.

The issue finds particular exposure in web server applications and/or
frameworks. In particular, the lack of sufficient limits for the number of
parameters in POST requests in conjunction with the predictable collision
properties in the hashing functions of the underlying languages can render web
applications vulnerable to the DoS condition. The attacker, using specially
crafted HTTP requests, can lead to a 100% of CPU usage which can last up to
several hours depending on the targeted application and server performance, the
amplification effect is considerable and requires little bandwidth and time on
the attacker side.

The condition for predictable collisions in the hashing functions has
been reported for the following language implementations:
[Java](http://www.java.com),
[JRuby](http://jruby.org/),
[PHP](http://www.php.net/),
[Python](http://python.org/),
[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/).
In the case of the Ruby language, the 1.9.x branch is not affected
by the predictable collision condition since this version includes a
randomization of the hashing function.

The vulnerability outlined in this advisory is practically identical to the one
reported in 2003 and described in the paper
[Denial of Service via Algorithmic Complexity Attacks](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf)
which affected the Perl language.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## In this article

.NET is an integral part of many apps running on Windows and provides common functionality for those apps to run. For developers, .NET Framework provides a comprehensive and consistent programming model for building apps that have visually stunning user experiences and seamless and secure communication.

Note

This article is intended for **developers** who either want to install .NET Framework on their own system or who want to install it with their applications. For **users** interested in installing .NET Framework, see the individual articles that discuss installing .NET Framework on specific operating systems, such as [Install .NET Framework on Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016](on-windows-10).

This article provides links for installing all versions of .NET Framework from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET Framework 4.8.1 on your computer. If you're a developer, you can also use these links to download and redistribute .NET Framework with your apps. For information on deploying a version of .NET Framework with your app, see [.NET Framework deployment guide for developers](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers).

Important

.NET Framework content previously digitally signed using certificates that use the SHA1 algorithm, will be retired in order to support evolving industry standards.

The following versions of .NET Framework will reach end-of-support on *April 26, 2022*: 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1. After this date, security fixes, updates, and technical support for these versions will no longer be provided.

If you're using .NET Framework 4.5.2, 4.6, or 4.6.1, update your deployed runtime to a more recent version, such as **.NET Framework 4.6.2**, before *April 26, 2022* in order to continue to receive updates and technical support.

Updated SHA2 signed installers will be available for .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, and 4.6.2 through 4.8. For more information, see the [SHA1 retirement plan](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-retiring-sha-1-content-9750f20d-a9ef-4d43-853f-2075f0a9d7da), the [.NET 4.5.2, 4.6, and 4.6.1 lifecycle update blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-will-reach-end-of-support-on-april-26-2022/), and the [FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/-net-framework-4-5-2-4-6-4-6-1-end-of-support-faq-72b7d8ca-3057-4f0c-8404-67305d40cc04).

Important

All .NET Framework versions since .NET Framework 4 are in-place updates, so only a single 4.x version can be present on a system. In addition, particular versions of .NET Framework are preinstalled on some versions of the Windows operating system. This means that:

* If there's a later 4.x version installed on the machine already, you can't install a previous 4.x version.
* If the OS comes preinstalled with a particular .NET Framework version, you can't install a previous 4.x version on the same machine.
* If you install a later version, you don't have to first uninstall the previous version.

For more information about versions of .NET Framework and how to determine which versions are installed on a computer, see [Versions and Dependencies](../migration-guide/versions-and-dependencies) and [How to: Determine Which .NET Framework Versions Are Installed](../migration-guide/how-to-determine-which-versions-are-installed).

Note

For information on .NET Framework 3.5, see [Install the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 11, Windows 10, Windows 8.1, and Windows 8](dotnet-35-windows).

Use the following table for quick links, or read further for details. To view the system requirements for .NET Framework before installation, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements). For help with troubleshooting, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

Important

Starting with Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio no longer includes .NET Framework components for .NET Framework 4.0 - 4.5.1 because these versions are no longer supported. Visual Studio 2022 and later versions can't build apps that target .NET Framework 4.0 through .NET Framework 4.5.1. To continue building these apps, you can use Visual Studio 2019 or an earlier version.

You can install the **Developer Pack** for a specific version of the .NET Framework, if one is available, on all supported platforms.

**Developer Packs** only target a specific version of .NET Framework and don't include previous versions. For example, the .NET Framework 4.8 Developer Pack doesn't include .NET Framework 4.7.

You can install the **Web or Offline installer** on:

* Windows 8.1 and earlier
* Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier

For a full list, see [System Requirements](../get-started/system-requirements).

For a general introduction to .NET Framework for both users and developers, see [Getting Started](../get-started/). For information about deploying .NET Framework with your app, see the [deployment guide](../deployment/deployment-guide-for-developers). To read about the architecture and key features of .NET Framework, see the [overview](../get-started/overview).

## Installation choices

Install a developer targeting pack to develop against the most recent version of .NET Framework in Visual Studio or another development environment, or download the .NET Framework redistributable for distribution with your app or control.

### To install the .NET Framework Developer Pack or Targeting Pack

A *targeting pack* lets your app target a specific version of .NET Framework when developing in Visual Studio and some other development environments. A *developer pack* includes a specific version of .NET Framework and its accompanying SDK along with its corresponding targeting pack.

The developer pack for .NET Framework 4.5.1 or 4.5.2, the targeting pack for .NET Framework 4.6, and the developer pack for .NET Framework 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2, or 4.8 provides a particular .NET Framework's version of the reference assemblies, language packs, and IntelliSense files for use in an integrated development environment such as Visual Studio. If you're using Visual Studio, the developer pack or targeting pack also adds the installed version of .NET Framework to the target choices when you create a new project. Choose one of the following:

* [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
* [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
* [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
* [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
* [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
* [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
* [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452) to install version 4.5.2 on Windows 8.1 or earlier, Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2012, or other IDEs.
* [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451) to install version 4.5.1 on Visual Studio 2012 or other IDEs.

From the developer pack download page, choose **Download**. Next, choose **Run** or **Save**, and follow the instructions when prompted. You can also install the developer pack or targeting pack for a specific version of .NET Framework by selecting it from the optional components in the **.NET desktop development** workload in the Visual Studio Installer, as the following figure shows.

[![Visual Studio installer with .NET Framework options selected.](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework.png)](media/guide-for-developers/visual-studio-framework-large.png#lightbox)

When you target a particular version of .NET Framework, your application is built by using the reference assemblies that are included with that version's developer pack. At run time, assemblies are resolved from the Global Assembly Cache, and the reference assemblies are not used.

When building an application from Visual Studio or using MSBuild from the command line, MSBuild may display error MSB3644, "The reference assemblies for framework "*framework-version*" were not found." To address the error, download the developer pack or the targeting pack for that version of .NET Framework.

### To install or download the .NET Framework redistributable

Installers download .NET Framework components for an app or control that targets those versions of .NET Framework. These components must be installed on each computer where the app or control runs. These installers are redistributable, so you can include them in the setup program for your app.

The download page is provided in several languages, but most of the downloads are provided in English only. For additional language support, you must install a language pack.

Two types of redistributable installers are available:

* **Web installer** (web bootstrapper) downloads the required components and the language pack that matches the operating system of the installation computer from the web. This package is much smaller than the offline installer but requires a consistent Internet connection. You can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install additional language support.
* **Offline installer** (standalone redistributable) contains all the required components for installing .NET Framework but doesn't contain language packs. This download is larger than the web installer. The offline installer doesn't require an internet connection. After you run the offline installer, you can download the [standalone language packs](#to-install-language-packs) to install language support. Use the offline installer if you can't rely on having a consistent Internet connection.

Both web and offline installers are designed for x86-based and x64-based computers (see [system requirements](../get-started/system-requirements)), but do not support Itanium-based computers.

1. Open the download page for the .NET Framework version you want to install:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. Select the language for the download page. This option does not download the localized resources of .NET Framework; it only affects the text displayed on the download page.
3. Choose **Download**.
4. If prompted, select the download that matches your system architecture, and then choose **Next**.
5. When the download prompt appears, do *one* of the following:

   * If you want to install .NET Framework on your computer, choose **Run**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
   * If you want to download .NET Framework for redistribution, choose **Save**, and then follow the prompts on your screen.
6. If you want to download resources for additional languages, follow the instructions in the next section to install one or more language packs.

Note

If you encounter any problems during the installation, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshoot-blocked-installations-and-uninstallations).

**Installation notes:**

* .NET Framework 4.5 and later versions replace .NET Framework 4.0. When you install these versions on a system that has .NET Framework 4 installed, the assemblies are replaced.
* Uninstalling .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions also removes pre-existing .NET Framework 4 files. If you want to go back to .NET Framework 4, you must reinstall it and any updates to it. See [Installing the .NET Framework 4](/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/5a4x27ek%28v%3Dvs.100%29).
* You must have administrative credentials to install .NET Framework 4.5 or later versions.
* The .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable was updated on October 9, 2012 to correct an issue related to an improper timestamp on a digital certificate, which caused the digital signature on files produced and signed by Microsoft to expire prematurely. If you previously installed the .NET Framework 4.5 redistributable package dated August 16, 2012, we recommend that you update your copy with the latest redistributable from the [.NET Framework download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45). For more information about this issue, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2749655](/en-us/security-updates/SecurityAdvisories/2012/2749655).

## To install language packs

Language packs are executable files that contain the localized resources (such as translated error messages and UI text) for supported languages. If you don't install a language pack, .NET Framework error messages and other text are displayed in English. Note that the web installer automatically installs the language pack that matches your operating system, but you can download additional language packs to your computer. The offline installers don't include any language packs.

Important

The language packs don't contain the .NET Framework components that are required to run an app, so you must run the web or offline installer before you install a language pack. If you have already installed a language pack, uninstall it, install the .NET Framework, and then reinstall the language pack.

1. Open the language pack download page for the .NET Framework version you've installed:

   * [.NET Framework 4.8.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net481)
   * [.NET Framework 4.8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net48)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net471)
   * [.NET Framework 4.7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net47)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net462)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)
   * [.NET Framework 4.6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net46)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net452)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net451)
   * [.NET Framework 4.5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net45)
2. In the language list, choose the language you want to download, and wait a few seconds for the page to reload in that language.
3. Choose **Download**.

The following table lists the supported languages.

## Hash table implementations vulnerable to algorithmic complexity attacks

#### Vulnerability Note VU#903934

Original Release Date: 2011-12-28 | Last Revised: 2016-02-15

---

### Overview

Some programming language implementations do not sufficiently randomize their hash functions or provide means to limit key collision attacks, which can be leveraged by an unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

### Description

| Many applications, including common web framework implementations, use hash tables to map key values to associated entries. If the hash table contains entries for different keys that map to the same hash value, a hash collision occurs and additional processing is required to determine which entry is appropriate for the key. If an attacker can generate many requests containing colliding key values, an application performing the hash table lookup may enter a denial of service condition.  Hash collision denial-of-service attacks were first [detailed](http://www.cs.rice.edu/~scrosby/hash/CrosbyWallach_UsenixSec2003.pdf) in 2003, but [recent research](http://www.nruns.com/_downloads/advisory28122011.pdf) details how these attacks apply to modern language hash table implementations. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An application can be forced into a denial-of-service condition. In the case of some web application servers, specially-crafted POST form data may result in a denial-of-service. |
| --- |

### Solution

### [The PHP Group](#DWAN-8PYMFT) Affected

Updated:  December 28, 2011

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

We have not received a statement from the vendor.

### Vendor Information

According to the n.runs AG advisory:
"PHP 5 uses the DJBX33A (Dan Bernstein's times 33, addition) hash function and parses POST form data into the $\_POST hash table. Because of the structure of the hash function, it is vulnerable to an equivalent substring attack."

From the Workarounds section:
"The easiest way to reduce the impact of such an attack is to reduce the CPU time that a request is allowed to take. For PHP, this can be configured using the max\_input\_time parameter."

PHP 5.4.0 RC4 has been released which adds a max\_input\_vars directive to help mitigate hash collision attacks. Please note that this is a release candidate, not a stable release.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-100 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2638420)

Published: December 29, 2011 | Updated: July 10, 2012

**Version:** 1.6

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted web request to the target site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action in the context of an existing account on the ASP.NET site, including executing arbitrary commands. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to register an account on the ASP.NET site, and must know an existing user name.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the .NET Framework handles specially crafted requests, and how the ASP.NET Framework authenticates users and handles cached content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2659883](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2659883).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2638420](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638420) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

Customers running the Developer Preview software are encouraged to download and apply the update to their systems. For more information, including Microsoft Download Center links, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles:

| Affected Software | Microsoft Knowledge Base Article |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2656360](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656360) |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2656354](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656354) |

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this update includes functional changes to the ASP.NET framework. The update limits the maximum number of form keys, files, and JSON members to 1000 in a request. This change results in ASP.NET applications rejecting requests having greater than 1000 of such elements. Clients making requests of these types will be denied and will see an error message in their browsers (typically an error 500). This limit can be configured per application. Please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2661403](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2661403).

The update also changes the format of forms authentication tickets in a way that could be incompatible with the older version of forms authentication tickets. For example, after installing this update, in web farm environments where some servers are updated while others are not, there may be the case where the updated servers could generate forms authentication tickets that are incompatible on non-updated servers. Please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2661404](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2661404).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**There are two updates listed for the version of the Microsoft .NET Framework installed on my system. Do I need to install both updates?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of the .NET Framework can be applied in any sequence. We recommend that multiple updates for different versions of the .NET Framework be applied in sequence from lowest version number to highest, however that sequence is not required.

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed also need to install security updates for the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle.

## Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that ASP.NET Framework handles specially crafted requests, causing a hash collision. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could send a small number of specially crafted requests to an ASP.NET server, causing performance to degrade significantly enough to cause a denial of service condition.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3414](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3414).

#### Mitigating Factors for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, IIS is not enabled on any Windows operating system
* Sites that disallow application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data HTTP content types are not vulnerable
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configuration-based workaround**

  The following workaround configures the limit of the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client. Decreasing the maximum request size will decrease the susceptibility of the ASP.NET server to a denial of service attack.

  **Note:** Please back up your configuration before you make any changes to it.

  This configuration value can be applied globally to all ASP.NET sites on a server by adding the entry to root web.config or applicationhost.config. Alternatively, this configuration can be restricted to a particular site or application by adding it to a web.config file for the particular site or application. For more information on ASP.NET configuration, please reference the MSDN article [ASP.NET Configuration Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms178683.aspx).

  1. If your application uses ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 200 KB.

     ```
     <configuration>

     ```

<system.web>
<httpruntime maxrequestlength="200â />
</system.web>
</configuration>
```

```
2.  If your application does not use ASP.NET ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 20 KB.

    ```
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;httpRuntime maxRequestLength=">

```

</system.web>
```

```
2.  If your application does not use ASP.NET ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 20 KB.

    ```
    <configuration>

```

<system.web>
<httpruntime maxrequestlength="20â />
</system.web>
</configuration>
```

```
For more information on the maxRequestLength configuration option, please refer to MSDN documentation on the [httpRuntime Element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1f13641.aspx).

**Note:** Increasing the default HTTP querystring and request header size limits will increase the susceptibility of the server to the denial of service issue being described in this advisory. For more information about how to set these limits, see [Http.sys registry settings for IIS](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/820129).

**Impact of workaround:** Client requests that exceed the configured maxRequestLength will result in a ConfigurationErrorsException thrown on the server-side and an http error status returned to the client. The limits configured previously should be used as a baseline and can be adjusted to avoid application failures. Configuring the maxRequestLength value with a smaller value also reduces the serverâs susceptibility to this particular denial of service. Applications that accept client file uploads and those that generate a large viewstate are examples of applications that may be impacted by this workaround.

After you apply this workaround, the following client request failure may appear in Application event log.

```
    Event code: 3004
    Event message: Post size exceeded allowed limits.
     Exception information:
          Exception type: HttpException
          Exception message: Maximum request length exceeded.
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.GetEntireRawContent()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.FillInFormCollection()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_Form()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_HasForm()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.GetCollectionBasedOnMethod(Boolean dontReturnNull)
    at System.Web.UI.Page.DeterminePostBackMode()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint)
```

Alternatively, the request failure may result in the following entry in an IIS log file.

```
    #Fields: s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
```

```
    127.0.0.1 POST /webSite/Default.aspx - 80 - 127.0.0.1 - 500 0 0 1268
```

**Removing workaround:** To undo the workaround, remove the configuration sections that were added in this workaround or revert to a backup of the configuration before the workarounds.

```

## Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework verifies return URLs during the forms authentication process. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. The attacker could then perform a phishing attack to gain information from the user they did not intend to disclose. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3415](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3415).

#### Mitigating Factors for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise user information.
* By default, installing ASP.NET does not enable Forms Authentication. It has to be explicitly configured per-application to be enabled.
* By default, IIS is not installed.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* The attacker would have to convince the user to click a link in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable Forms Authentication in web.config**
  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the authentication mode to either Windows, Passport or None.

     ```
     &lt;system.web&gt;

         &lt;authentication mode=">

     ```

</system.web>
```

```

## Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

A spoofing vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework verifies return URLs during the forms authentication process. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability would be able to redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. The attacker could then perform a phishing attack to gain information from the user they did not intend to disclose. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3415](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3415).

#### Mitigating Factors for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to produce information that could be used to try to further compromise user information.
* By default, installing ASP.NET does not enable Forms Authentication. It has to be explicitly configured per-application to be enabled.
* By default, IIS is not installed.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* The attacker would have to convince the user to click a link in order to exploit the vulnerability.

#### Workarounds for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

#### FAQ for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability. This vulnerability could enable an attacker to redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. The attacker could then perform a phishing attack to gain information from the user they did not intend to disclose. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

**What is phishing?**

Online phishing (pronounced like fishing) is a way to trick computer users into revealing personal or financial information through a fraudulent email message or website. A common online phishing scam starts with an email message that resembles an official notice from a trusted source, such as a bank, credit card company, or reputable online merchant. In the email message, recipients are directed to a fraudulent website where they are asked to provide personal information, such as an account number or password. This information is then usually used for identity theft.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework incorrectly verifies return URLs during the forms authentication process.

**What is Forms Authentication in ASP.NET?**

Forms authentication uses an authentication ticket that is created when a user logs on to a site, and then it tracks the user throughout the site. The forms authentication ticket is usually contained inside a cookie. However, ASP.NET version 2.0 supports cookieless forms authentication, which results in the ticket being passed in a query string. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Explained: Forms Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff647070.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could create a specially crafted URL and convince a user to click it. After a user logs in to an expected website, the attacker then redirects the user to a website controlled by the attacker. Then, the attacker could convince the user to divulge information otherwise intended to remain private. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website after logging in to an expected website.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet-facing systems with ASP.NET installed are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal websites that use ASP.NET forms authentication can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the .NET Framework verifies return URLs during forms authentication.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework authenticates users. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would need to be able to register an account on the ASP.NET application, and must know an existing account name for a targeted user. The attacker could then craft a special web request using a previously registered account name to gain access to that account. The attacker could then take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3416](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3416).

* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set ticketCompatibilityMode to Framework40**

  This only applies to sites that are running ASP.NET 4 and newer because the ticketCompatibilityMode setting was introduced in ASP.NET v4.0.

  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the ticketCompatibilityMode to Framework40. Note that the default value for this setting is "Framework20"

     ```
     <system.web>

     ```

```
```

#### FAQ for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability where a remote unauthenticated attacker can gain access to another account on the ASP.NET application, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the site in the context of the targeted user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the ASP.NET Framework incorrectly authenticates specially crafted usernames.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would first need to have knowledge of an existing account name to impersonate on the site. The attacker could then craft a special web request using a previously registered account name to gain access to that account. The attacker could then take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet-facing systems with ASP.NET installed are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal websites that use ASP.NET forms authentication can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**If my website uses a web farm, will I need to update all the** **computers** **in the web farm?**

Yes. This update changes the format of the forms authentication ticket in a way that is incompatible with the earlier format. This means that tickets generated by using the new behavior cannot be read by computers using the old behavior, and vice versa. Administrators whose applications use forms-based authentication must take specific steps when deploying this security update to ensure that all of their servers switch to the new behavior simultaneously.

For more information, see the [Microsoft TechNet Article 2659968](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2659968).

**Is it possible to update the** **computers** **in my web farm one at a time** **instead ofall at the same time?**

Yes. If it is not feasible to deploy MS11-100 to all the servers in a given web farm simultaneously, you can set a compatibility switch in your web.config or machine.config file before installing the update to force the old behavior after the update is installed. The compatibility switch to use is as follows:

```
<appsettings>
<add key="aspnet:UseLegacyFormsAuthenticationTicketCompatibility" value="true">
</add></appsettings>

```

Setting this switch will allow web farms with only some machines updated to continue functioning correctly. However, it is important to know that computers with the configuration switch set will be in an insecure state, and will not benefit from the fix in this security update. After MS11-100 has been deployed to all the computers in a farm, the configuration switch must be removed to enable the new, secure behavior.

**Will this update honor my siteâs forms authentication ticketCompatibilityMode setting?**

No. Since the fix in this security update changes the format of forms authentication tickets, the ticketCompatibilityMode configuration setting is no longer supported once MS11-100 is installed.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Framework authenticates users.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that ASP.NET Framework handles cached content when Forms Authentication is used with sliding expiry. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action including executing arbitrary commands that the user could take on the site in the context of the target user. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted link to the user and convincing the user to click the link. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3417](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3417).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, ASP.NET responses are not cached by the OutputCache. The developer of the site has to opt in to output caching through the OutputCache directive on a page.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the target user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, IIS is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install this are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict forms authentication cookies to SSL channels**

  Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy.

  Set requireSSL="true" on the <forms> element, as shown in the following code.

  ```
      <forms loginurl="Secure\Login.aspx" requiressl="true">

  ```

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.
* **Disable sliding expiration for forms authentication cookies**

  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set slidingExpiration="false" on the <forms> element, as shown in the following code.

     ```
     </forms><forms slidingexpiration="false">

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Users would be forced to re-login after their tickets expire.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.
* **Disable OutputCache**

  1. Back up your web application folder.
  2. Remove all <%@ OutputCache %> directives in your web pages.
  3. If your website is an MVC application, also remove all OutputCache attributes from your controller actions.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users would be forced to re-login after their tickets expire.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

**Reference Table**

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files.

This security update supports the following setup switches for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **Setup Modes** |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| **Install Options** |  |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/nobackup** | Do not back up files for uninstall. |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrite OEM files without prompting. |
| \*\*/integrate:\*\**path* | Integrates the software updates into the Windows installation source files located at the path specified. Note that *:path* refers to the folder that contains the i386 folder. |
| **/ER** | Enable extended error reporting. |
| \*\*/d:\*\**path* | Specifies a backup directory for Windows Service Pack installation. *:path* indicates the destination folder for the backup files. The default backup location is *%Systemdrive%*\$ntservicepackuninstall$. |
| **/extract[:***path***]** | Extracts files without starting Setup. If "*:path*" is not included, you are prompted for the path of a destination folder to extract the files. If "*:path*" is used, the files are extracted to the specified destination folder. |
| **/hotpatch:disable** | Disables hotpatching functionality, and installs the cold patch only. |
| **Restart Options** |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| **Logging Options** |  |
| \*\*/log:\*\**path* | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates *%Windir%*\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)

**Reference Table**

The following table contains the security update information for this software. You can find additional information in the subsection, **Deployment Information**, in this section.

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

| **Restart Requirement** |  |
| Restart required? | This update does not require a restart. The installer stops the required services, applies the update, and then restarts the services. However, if the required services cannot be stopped for any reason, or if required files are being used, this update will require a restart. If this behavior occurs, a message appears that advises you to restart. |
| HotPatching | Not applicable. |
| **Removal Information** | To uninstall an update installed by WUSA, click **Control Panel**, and then click **Security**. Under Windows Update, click **View installed updates** and select from the list of updates. |
| **File Information** | See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2638420](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638420) |

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

Supported Security Update Installation Switches

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/?, /h, /help** | Displays help on supported switches. |
| **/quiet** | Suppresses the display of status or error messages. |
| **/norestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the system will not be restarted after installation even if a restart is required to complete installation. |
| **/warnrestart:<seconds>** | When combined with **/quiet**, the installer will warn the user before initiating restart. |
| **/promptrestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the installer will prompt before initiating restart. |
| **/forcerestart** | When combined with **/quiet**, the installer will forcefully close applications and initiate restart. |
| **/log:<file name>** | Enables logging to specified file. |
| **/extract:<destination>** | Extracts the package contents to the destination folder. |
| **/uninstall /kb:<KB Number>** | Uninstalls the security update. |

**Note** For more information about the wusa.exe installer, see "Windows Update Stand-alone Installer" in the TechNet article, [Miscellaneous Changes in Windows 7](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd871148%28ws.10%29.aspx).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
