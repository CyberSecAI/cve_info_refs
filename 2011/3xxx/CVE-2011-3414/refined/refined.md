Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3414:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the predictable nature of hashing algorithms used in various programming language implementations and web frameworks. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the lack of sufficient randomization in hash functions and inadequate limits on key collisions within hash table data structures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Predictable Hash Collisions:** The primary vulnerability is the predictable nature of the hashing algorithms, which allows attackers to generate inputs that cause hash collisions, leading to a degradation of performance of the hash table data structure.
- **Lack of Input Limits:** Many implementations lacked sufficient limits on the number of parameters (especially in POST requests), making them susceptible to a denial of service by overwhelming the hash table.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial of service, where an attacker can use specially crafted requests to cause the targeted application to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to significant performance degradation or complete unavailability.
- **CPU Exhaustion:** Crafted HTTP requests with colliding keys can lead to 100% CPU usage, potentially for extended periods.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through specially crafted HTTP requests, especially POST requests that contain a large number of parameters that result in hash collisions.
- **Web Applications/Frameworks:** Web servers and applications are particularly exposed, as they often use hash tables to store data from requests and may not have adequate limits for the number of parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Remote Access:** Attackers can trigger this vulnerability remotely without needing to be authenticated.
- **Knowledge of Target Implementation:** Attackers need knowledge of the vulnerable implementations, hashing algorithms, and parameter handling mechanisms to craft malicious requests.
- **Network Access:** Attackers need network access to send the malicious HTTP requests to the target server.
