Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2011-3602:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `set_interface_var()` function in radvd doesn't properly validate the interface name (`ifname`) before using it to construct a file path. It blindly concatenates the provided interface name with other path components and uses it to open a file for writing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of input validation on `ifname` allows an attacker to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `..`, `/`) into the interface name.
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** By crafting a malicious `ifname` that includes path traversal elements, an attacker can cause the `set_interface_var()` function to create and overwrite files in arbitrary locations on the file system, provided the radvd process has the required permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A local attacker could overwrite files on the system with a decimal value, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service depending on which files are overwritten.
*   **Privilege Escalation (potential):** If radvd is not running under a non-privileged user, it could be leveraged to overwrite system files with elevated privileges, although this impact was mitigated by default configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector involves a local attacker, or an attacker who has compromised an unprivileged radvd daemon.
*   **Interface Name Manipulation:** The attacker would need to manipulate the interface name provided to `set_interface_var()` function by crafting an interface name that contains path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account or Compromised radvd Process:** The attacker needs to have either a local user account on the system running radvd or has compromised a process that is able to pass parameters to the vulnerable function.
*   **Ability to Create Symlinks:** If not having a local account, the attacker needs the ability to create symbolic links in a temporary directory that would redirect writes to a target file via the crafted path.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present because the `set_interface_var` function uses the interface name, which is provided by an unprivileged user, to construct a file path.
*   The `set_interface_var()` function was used to overwrite specific files in the `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/` directory. Although the vulnerability can be used to overwrite arbitrary files with crafted symlinks, without it, only the specific files could be overwritten.
*   The fix involves checking for the presence of `..` and `/` characters in the interface name.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in radvd version 1.8.2.
