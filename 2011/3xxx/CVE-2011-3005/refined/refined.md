    "related": true,
    "official_description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "extracted_information": {
      "root_cause": "Use-after-free condition in Ogg file processing.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability occurs due to improper handling of Ogg file headers, leading to a use-after-free condition. The program frees a buffer but still holds a pointer to the freed memory, and continues to use that dangling pointer."
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, allowing for malware installation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector involves loading a specially crafted `.ogg` file in a vulnerable application, such as Firefox."
       ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious Ogg file that triggers the use-after-free condition. The attacker also needs to trick a user into opening the malicious Ogg file in a vulnerable application."
