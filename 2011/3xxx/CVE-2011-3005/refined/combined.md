How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

firefox should just not play the video like it normally does for corrupted videos rather than seg faulting

Attached patch

[Patch v1](attachment.cgi?id=549965&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=549965&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=675747&attachment=549965)

The problem is that we're creating a new nsOggCodecState for every bos page we encounter in the stream, and storing a mapping from stream serialno to the nsOggCodecState in the mCodecStates hash table. There are two bos pages for the Vorbis stream. When we create the second nsOggCodecState and add it to mCodecState, we overwrite the original seiral-to-nsOggCodecState mapping in mCoedcStates. mCodecStates holds the owning reference, so the memory pointed to be mVorbisState is then cleared, and when we try to use mVorbisState at nsOggReader.cpp:288 we crash.
So I propose we simply don't create a new nsOggCodecState for serialnos we've seen before in bos pages. The media plays correctly then.

I believe this is exploitable, in most files that trigger the crash the free'd memory is not given to anything, but in the example.ogg I attached, for some reason the free'd mVorbisState buffer is then always allocated in the theora decoder at huffdec.c:399 "tree=(ogg\_int16\_t \*)\_ogg\_malloc(size\*sizeof(\*tree));"
in particular what is stored in the important part of the buffer is "leaf=(ogg\_int16\_t)-(\_tokens[ti][1]-depth[l]<<8|\_tokens[ti][0]);" in example.ogg leaf is 0xfbfc and when I run the normal linux 32 bit binary from the mozilla download page it crashes with instruction pointer = this address:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread 0xe56ffb70 (LWP 5514)]
0xfbfcfbfc in ?? ()
I believe \_tokens comes from the video file so we should have some control over the value. I don't think its even necessary to have complete control over the value, just make it something a bit less than 0xfbfcfbfc and you can do a standard javascript heap spray

Just so I understand this, are you saying that exploit happens if we don't crash in ReaderHeaders()? The memory pointed to by mVorbisState gets reallocated in the Theora decoder setup, and then we overwrite the Theora decode info when we init mVorbisState and then the exploit happens when we use the Theora decode info later to to decode some Theora data pages subsequently?
That sounds... plausible to me...

The attacker control of that value is somewhat limited: the smallest non-zero value you can get is 0xf8e1f8e1. Bytes 0 and 2 will always be either between 0xe1 and 0xff, or 0x00 (\_tokens[ti][0] will be between 0 and 31, inclusive), and bytes 1 and 3 will always be between 0xf8 and 0xff, or 0x00 (nbits will always be between 1 and 7, inclusive, and \_tokens[ti][1]-depth[l] is <= nbits). The only way to get \_tokens[ti][1]==depth[l] (i.e., to get 0x00 in one of the odd bytes) is with a singleton tree, in which case you will write exactly 32 bits into the buffer, both odd bytes will be 0x00, and both even bytes will also have to be 0x00 (or carry propagation would make the odd bytes 0xff). So the only possible value less than 0xf8e1f8e1 is 0x00000000.
But I don't know enough to say that that would make this unexploitable.

To clarify,
1. mVorbisState is free'd
2. theora mallocs some memory and recieves the same location mVorbisState was
3. theora modifies the memory, which you have some control over as tim describes above. If you can only make the value > 0xf8e1f8e1 it should still be fine, just a bit less convenient as you will need to place shellcode in the stack instead of the heap
4. mVorbisState->Init() is called. I do not know c++ internals, but apparently that equals the assembly instruction call [rax+0x30] where rax comes from the mVorbisState buffer and is the previously mentioned value from theora we have some control over
This is in 64bit linux firefox 5, the "recent linux64 debug build" above looks like it crashes in a slightly different place
So 64 bit linux crashes due to a read violation on the instruction call [0xfbfcfbfcfbfcfbfc + 0x30], but on 32 bit linux (I am not sure why) it actually crashes with the instruction pointer at address $eip = 0xfbfcfbfc
Of course the only real way to show it's exploitable is with an actual exploit. I'm busy this weekend but will try to write one next week.

I finally wrote an exploit for this bug. Download the attached exploit.html and exploit.ogg in the same folder and visit exploit.html in firefox. I have only coded the exploit for 32 bit linux, and while it might work with random distro's firefox binary I have only tested it with the official mozilla 32 bit linux download firefox-5.0.1. Currently the exploit just prints out "hi!" but of course you can replace the code for printing "hi!" with something more malicious. It works about 90% of the time for me with address space layout randomization off and a bit under 50% of the time with address space layout randomization on though I'm sure that could be improved by someone better at exploit writing than me.

Patch v2
Someone more qualified than I needs to make a call on whether this exploit warrants respinning the beta/release-candidate builds, so nominating for beta approval.
\* Exploit has only been demonstrated on 32bit Linux, and is less than 100% reproducibility, though higher may be possible.
\* Exploit relies on the system malloc returning the memory allocated to a Vorbis decoder (which was incorrectly freed, but to which we still hold a pointer) when allocating a Theora decoder. The Vorbis decoder is initialized in that memory (using setup data read from an ogg file), which overwrites the Theora decoder's memory. When the Theora decoder decodes data, because its setup data is corrupted, the exploit happens.
\* Not sure if this can happen on non-Linux platforms, it relies on system malloc behaviour (not jemalloc behaviour).
\* Patch is landed in aurora, so if we don't take this on beta, the fix will reach users in 6 more weeks.

Just to clarify a few things,
While what I said above about using the theora stuff might be possible but this exploit works a much simpler way.
The exploitable bug:
1. A buffer used by ogg decoder is freed.
2. Stuff happens.
3. the instruction call [$eax + 0x18] is executed where $eax is the first word from the freed buffer
Normally the freed memory is garbage so it simply crashes. But, in the exploit.html as the video is started I have looping in the background javascript that rapidly allocates strings of the same size as the buffer that is freed. Almost of all of the time, one of these strings receives the same location in memory as the buffer. We can put whatever we want in the string, so we can control the value of $eax at the instruction call [$eax+0x18], which is straightforward to exploit. I have tested this on windows xp 32 bit and it crashes with attacker control of $eax so it is certainly exploitable on windows as well, I just have a little experience writing exploits for linux and no experience with windows so I wrote it for linux.

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaThunderbird: Update to Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.14
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2011:1076-2
Rating: important
References: #720264
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
openSUSE 11.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.1.14, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products.
Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 6. (CVE-2011-2995)
Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight, Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor
Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and Marcia Knous
reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 6,
fixed in Firefox 7. (CVE-2011-2997)
MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that
a frame named "location" could shadow the window.location
object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. Because some
plugins use the value of window.location to determine the
page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the
plugin content access to another site or the local file
system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
(CVE-2011-2999)
MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that
when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect
response Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers:
Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome
and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of
this header with different values could be a symptom of a
CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most
commonly it is the Location header itself that is
vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy
preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious
one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server
vulnerability.
The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two
copies of this header with different values as an error
condition. The same has been done with the headers
Content-Length and Content-Disposition. (CVE-2011-3000)
MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could
convince a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a
game or test, perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a
download dialog where the held key would then activate the
default Open action. For some file types this would be
merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a
vulnerability in applications not normally exposed to
potentially hostile internet content.
Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin
installation using the PLUGINSPAGE attribute. It was
possible to create an internal error that suppressed a
confirmation dialog, such that holding enter would lead to
the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant did
not affect Firefox 3.6)
Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to
Download Manager (CVE-2011-2372)
Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation
(CVE-2011-3001)
MFSA 2011-42: Security researcher Aki Helin reported a
potentially exploitable crash in the YARR regular
expression library used by JavaScript. (CVE-2011-3232)
MFSA 2011-44: sczimmer reported that Firefox crashed when
loading a particular .ogg file. This was due to a
use-after-free condition and could potentially be exploited
to install malware. (CVE-2011-3005)
This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6 or earlier.
