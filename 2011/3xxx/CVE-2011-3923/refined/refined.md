  "CVE-2011-3923": {
    "description": "Apache Struts before 2.3.1.2 allows remote attackers to bypass security protections in the ParameterInterceptor class and execute arbitrary commands.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The ParameterInterceptor in Apache Struts does not properly sanitize input, allowing parentheses which are then interpreted as OGNL expressions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation",
        "OGNL expression injection",
        "Remote command execution vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the vulnerable application.",
       "attack_vectors": [
         "HTTP GET requests with specially crafted parameters"
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.",
       "required_position": "Remote",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be triggered via exception handling or ParameterInterceptor. The OGNL expression can be stored in string properties and accessed by a dynamic function call. This allows bypassing security restrictions and executing arbitrary Java code."
