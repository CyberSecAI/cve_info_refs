Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-3871:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `--edit` mode of the `puppet resource` command. This mode uses a predictable temporary file name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Predictable Filename:** The temporary file name used by `puppet resource --edit` is easily predictable.
*   **Persistent File:** The temporary file persists for a duration long enough to allow for exploitation.
*   **Lack of Privilege Separation:** The temporary file, once created, is executed with the privileges of the user invoking the `puppet resource` command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Editing:** An attacker can trick the user (typically root) into editing an arbitrary file by placing a symlink with the predictable filename before the temporary file creation.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By crafting the contents of the predictable temporary file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user who ran `puppet resource --edit`. This often leads to privilege escalation when the command is executed as root.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink with the predictable file name in a location where Puppet will write the temporary file, before `puppet resource` is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have a local user account on the system where the vulnerable Puppet version is running.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker needs write access to a directory where Puppet may create temporary files.
*   **Knowledge of the Predictable Filename:** The attacker needs to know, or be able to predict, the name of the temporary file that Puppet will create.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is considered critical due to its potential for local privilege escalation, especially because `puppet resource` is often run as root.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Puppet versions 2.6.11 and 2.7.5.
*   The fix was to prevent `puppet resource --edit` from using a predictable file name.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of Puppet prior to the fix, including those in Ubuntu 10.04, 10.10 and 11.04.
