CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3848 CVE-2011-3870 CVE-2011-3869 CVE-2011-3871

Multiple security issues have been discovered in puppet, a centralized
configuration management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-3848

    Kristian Erik Hermansen reported that an unauthenticated
    directory traversal could drop any valid X.509 Certificate Signing
    Request at any location on disk, with the privileges of the Puppet
    Master application.

CVE-2011-3870

    Ricky Zhou discovered a potential local privilege escalation in the
    ssh_authorized_keys resource and theoretically in the Solaris and
    AIX providers, where file ownership was given away before it was
    written, leading to a possibility for a user to overwrite arbitrary
    files as root, if their authorized_keys file was managed.

CVE-2011-3869

    A predictable file name in the k5login type leads to the possibility
    of symlink attacks which would allow the owner of the home directory
    to symlink to anything on the system, and have it replaced with the
    "correct" content of the file, which can lead to a privilege escalation
    on puppet runs.

CVE-2011-3871

    A potential local privilege escalation was found in the --edit mode
    of 'puppet resource' due to a persistant, predictable file name,
    which can result in editing an arbitrary target file, and thus be
    be tricked into running that arbitrary file as the invoking
    user.  This command is most commonly run as root, this leads to a
    potential privilege escalation.

Additionally, this update hardens the indirector file backed terminus base
class against injection attacks based on trusted path names.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.

# USN-1223-2: Puppet regression

5 October 2011

USN-1223-1 caused a regression with managing SSH authorized\_keys files.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [puppet](/security/cves?package=puppet) - Centralized configuration management

## Details

USN-1223-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Puppet. A regression was found on

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS that caused permission denied errors when managing SSH

authorized\_keys files with Puppet. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type

is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite

arbitrary files which could be used to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-3869](/security/CVE-2011-3869))

Ricky Zhou discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when creating

SSH authorized\_keys files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite

arbitrary files as root. ([CVE-2011-3870](/security/CVE-2011-3870))

It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename when using the

--edit resource. A local attacker could exploit this to edit arbitrary

files or run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically

root. ([CVE-2011-3871](/security/CVE-2011-3871))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

# CVE-2011-3871

### CVSS 3 Base Score:

### Posted On: October 27, 2011

### Assessed Risk Level: None

**Type**: Local Privilege Escalation

Previously, puppet resource in --edit mode used an extremely predictable file name, which would persist on human timescales, could be known well ahead of creation, and would be run as the invoking user upon completion of the operation.

This could be exploited to trick the invoking user into editing an arbitrary target file, or running arbitrary Puppet code. As puppet resource is not very effective when not run as root, the potential effect of an attack was quite high.

## Status:

**Affected software versions:****Resolved in:**

* Resolved in Puppet 2.6.11 and 2.7.5

# USN-1223-1: Puppet vulnerabilities

30 September 2011

Puppet could be made to overwrite files and run programs with administrator
privileges.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [puppet](/security/cves?package=puppet) - Centralized configuration management

## Details

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type

is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite

arbitrary files which could be used to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-3869](/security/CVE-2011-3869))

Ricky Zhou discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when creating

SSH authorized\_keys files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite

arbitrary files as root. ([CVE-2011-3870](/security/CVE-2011-3870))

It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename when using the

--edit resource. A local attacker could exploit this to edit arbitrary

files or run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically

root. ([CVE-2011-3871](/security/CVE-2011-3871))

Announce: New Puppet releases due to four security issues
=====

Following the security vulnerability announced yesterday (CVE-2011-3848),
Ricky Zhou (<ri...@fedorapeople.org>) alerted us to an unrelated
vulnerability. Our subsequent code audit uncovered three more vulnerabilities,
and we have now fixed all four of these new issues. (It's been a busy week.)

We have released the following updated versions of Puppet to fix these
vulnerabilities:

* 2.7.5
* 2.6.11

WE RECOMMEND UPDATING TO THESE VERSIONS IMMEDIATELY, as an issue with our ticketing
system resulted in information about these issues leaking to a
public list prior to this disclosure. Official announcements of these releases
are forthcoming momentarily, and the new versions can be downloaded at:

* <http://puppetlabs.com/security/hotfixes>
* <http://puppetlabs.com/downloads/puppet>

PUPPET ENTERPRISE USERS can download hotfix packages for PE versions 1.0, 1.1,
and 1.2.x at:

* <http://puppetlabs.com/security/hotfixes>

Puppet Labs has been coordinating with Debian, Ubuntu, EPEL and OpenSuSE
maintainers.  We expect new packages (with a patch backported in many cases)
to be released very soon, and downstream packagers may also release Puppet
0.25.x packages that include these fixes. Thank you for your patience, and as
always, please report security vulnerabilities to secu...@puppetlabs.com.

Vulnerability Details
---------------------

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered and fixed:

* CVE-2011-3870, a symlink attack via a user's SSH authorized_keys file
* CVE-2011-3869, a symlink attack via a user's .k5login file
* CVE-2011-3871, a privilege escalation attack via the temp file used by the puppet resource application
* A low-risk file indirector injection attack

SSH Authorized Keys Symlink -- CVE-2011-3870 (Critical)
----------------------

Type: Local Privilege Escalation

Credit to Ricky Zhou <ri...@fedorapeople.org> for the discovery and fix.

A TOCTOU (time-of-check-to-time-of-use) race vulnerability was present in the
ssh_authorized_key type (and theoretically in the Solaris and AIX providers).
When the target file and directory did not exist, each of them would be
created as root and later chowned to the user. This made it possible to
replace either one with a symlink to an arbitrary file, which would then
become owned by that user. This would allow local privilege escalation to root
through standard TOCTOU attack techniques.

Unlike most Puppet types, this risk was exacerbated by the nature of the
ssh_authorized_key type, which almost always manages data in directories
controlled by unprivileged (and likely untrusted) users.

This issue has been fixed by making all file operations happen with the
privileges of the target user, ensuring that a user can cause no harm beyond
their normal capabilities on the system.

k5login attach -- CVE-2011-3869 (Critical)
----------------------

Type: Local Privilege Escalation

The k5login type is typically used to manage a file in the home
directory of a user; the explicit purpose of this file is to allow
access to other users.

This type previously wrote to the target file directly, as root, without doing
anything to secure the file. If the .k5login file was replaced with a symlink,
this would allow the owner of the home directory to replace any file on the
system, including the .k5login file of a more privileged user, with the
“correct” content of their own file.

This issue was discovered during a code audit following the report of the ssh_authorized_key vulnerability, and the fix was very similar.

Predictable temp file using RAL -- CVE-2011-3871 (Critical)
----------------------

Type: Local Privilege Escalation

Previously, puppet resource in --edit mode used an extremely predictable file
name, which would persist on human timescales, could be known well ahead of
creation, and would be run as the invoking user upon completion of the
operation.

This could be exploited to trick the invoking user into editing an arbitrary
target file, or running arbitrary Puppet code. As puppet resource is not very
effective when not run as root, the potential effect of an attack was quite
high.

File indirector injection (Low risk)
----------------------

The indirector/file.rb terminus base class trusted the request key and used it
as part of the pathname, like the YAML and SslFile terminus base classes did.

The mitigating factor in this vulnerability was that this code was unused
except in one unit test, which has been rewritten.

If you have any questions or need additional clarification on
anything, please respond to secu...@puppetlabs.com.

Thanks,
Michael Stahnke

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
