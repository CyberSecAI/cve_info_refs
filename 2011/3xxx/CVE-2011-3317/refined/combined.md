How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Prerequisites
=============
This is a patch for release ACS 5.2.0.26. ACS 5.2.0.26 must be installed before installing thispatch. Other prerequisites are same as for ACS 5.2.0.26 (FCS Version).
What the Patch Fixes
====================
The patch fixes for the DDTS
- CSCth82664 ACS DB need to be compressed as a maintenance operation.
This fix introduced new CLI command in the acs config that should be use only on the primary node. The CLI command: 'acs-config database-compress [truncate\_log]'
This maintenance operation compress the ACS DB by rebuilding each table in the database and releasing unused space.
The command has also option to release the replication transaction table.
Before initiating the command, you should move all the secondary nodes to local mode. Then you should initiate the command on the primary node.
When the DB compress is completed and all the services are up, you should reconnect the secondary nodes, one by one.
On reconnection the secondaries, full-sync between the primary and the secondary will be initiate automatically.
- CSCth78269 ACSTRANSACTIONS table is not cleaned properly during bulk operations
The cleaning of the ACS transaction table (a table which keeps configuration change logs) was changed to be more intensive.We only keep the last 2k configuration transactions.
- CSCsu69983 Restoring a configuration disconnects deployment and causes replication
In the distributed setup ,when customer restores the backup on cli,it will throws awarning message and you will have to configure each secondary to re-connect with primary .
- CSCti90973 Adding "User is in management hierarchy" flag to T\+ authorization policy
In this solution a hierarchical label is assigned to each device that represents the administrative location of this device within the organizations management hierarchy.
For instance, "All:US:NY:MyMgmtCenter" denotes that the device is in "MyMgmtCenter" which is in NY which is in the US.
Permissions are granted to the user based on their assigned level within the management hierarchy.
For instance, if a user has an assigned level of "All:US:NY", that user will be granted permission when accessing through any device with a hierarchy that starts with "All:US:NY".
The following sections describe in detail how to configure this solution.
- CSCtg87278 ACS not able to establish SSL tunnel with LDAP server with CRL verification
This fix allows establish of SSL tunnel with LDAP server with CRL verification.
- CSCth62139 ACS authentication rate decreases with internal user attributes
The fix includes 2 parts :
1. Read only attributes value from request from DB (without user information - UserName, Password, EnablePassword, LastLoginTimae etc...).
2. Check default attribute value without try-catch mechanism.
- CSCti68031 ACS5 sees DC= in the certificate subject as invalid DN
With this fix DC= is allowed as part of the certificate subject when generating a certificate signing request.
- CSCti42591 NDG Locations disappeared from GUI
This fix enables the NDG locations to appear on the NDG GUI even after adding an attribute with name 'location' for internal users.
-CSCtk32073 Network Device Groups are not evaluated properly in Device Filters
The fix is in Device Filter creation. Therfore already created Device Filter using ACS 5.2 before patch 3 should be removed and created again.
- CSCtn25264 acsLocalStore.logs are unexpectedly deleted when restarting services.
With this fix acsLocalStore logs are not deleted unexpectedly when restaring services Because we changed New HD Limit to 97GB
- CSCth08274 View not loading next page in IE if usernames containing char \u
This issue has been fixed by encoding and decoding of username where ever it needed.
Even if the reports username contains \u and/or \x, the navigator buttons are working fine without giving any error in both IE and Mozilla Firefox.
The RADIUS\_Authentication.rptdesign file was modified, so customer has to click
Reset Report in page Monitoring & Reports > ... > Reports > Catalog > AAA Protocol for this fix to take effect.
- CSCtq38322 ACS does not retry LDAP connection after silent drop
ACS has been made resistant to situations when firewall or load balancer located between ACS and LDAP servers drops idle LDAP connections.
- CSCtq59282 AD Perf' impact 50%&more due to large amount of groups assigned to user
- CSCto99380 ACS failing to retrieve non-local groups from AD while authenticating
Evaluation of user's group membership against Active Directory has been optimized to address above two issues.
- CSCto15691 ACS runtime process restarts intermittently under heavy Tacacs load
The problem is triggered by Tacacs clients [automatic tools] that do not complete the conversation and keep the T+ connection open for a long time.
Fixed T+ connection management issue.
- CSCto76026 RT crash on PAP RSA stress
Fixed race condition causing ACS restarts on PAP authentication load against RSA.
- CSCtq64670 Incorrect Password prompt when using RSA authentication
On TACACS+ authentication of an internal user which configured with RSA identity store on 'password type',
the password prompt is taken from RSA prompts setup as expected.
- CSCtq26661 ACS 5 fails import certificate with serial number in subject
The issue is addressed by parsing the server cert to accommodate for serial number in subject as per RFC-3739, sec. 3.1.2.
- CSCto47203 ACS 5 runs out of disk space
There are two problems reported in this bug.
1. Currently, the view database purge operation works as follows.
- When the size of the view database reaches 120 GB, it checks whether the last full/incremental backup was successful.
If it was successful, then, it will purge data based on purge window setting configured by the user, to bring the size of the database to below 120 GB.
If the last backup was not successful, it will do nothing.
- when size of the View database reaches 150 GB, then, irrespective of the status of the previous backup operation,
data would be purged either to bring it down to 120 GB or to retain only last one month data, which is ever is met first.
The problem is, if last one month's data itself is more than 150 GB, then, the current purge operation does not do anything with that.
2. The size of the Sybase database is not reduced even after deleting records or truncating tables.
According to Sybase, it is by design for some good reasons (such as reducing I/O operations, etc.)
The above issues are resolved as follows.
1. To resolve the problem in purge,
1.1 If last one month data itself exceeds 150 GB, ACS purges first three weeks data in last month until it reaches 120 GB limit.
1.2 Since incremental backup is mandatory to purge data (upon reaching 120 GB mark), ACS has been enhanced to send alerts if incremental backup is not configured.
ACS sends warning when view database size reaches 114 GB (95% of 120 GB). It sends critical alert when database size exceeds 120 GB and 150 GB respectively.
2. To work around the problem in Sybase, where the size of the database not reduced even after purge,
we have provided a CLI (acsview-db-compress) command in acs-config mode to compress view database file size.
This command compresses the ACS View DB by rebuilding each table in the database and releasing unused space.
This will reduce the physical size of the database. During this process, ACS will be stopped.
Once the database compress operation is over, services will be started automatically.
Note that the time taken for compress operation will vary depending on the size of database.
If the database size is huge, the compress operation will take hours. This CLI needs to be executed only LogCollector server.
It is strongly recommended to execute this CLI only on maintenance hours as it requires restart ACS services.
The option to compress the view database is also mentioned in the description of one of the alerts that is sent when view database reaches certain limit.
- CSCtn25508 Administrative and Operational Audit logs becomes unable to be recorded.
This fix address the issue of Administrative and Operational Audit logs no longer reported due to the reason of missing records in ACSTRANSACTION Table.
- CSCtk83179 ACS 5 View export to remote SQL DB not working
This address the remote database export funtionality issue in 5.2 version.
with this fix the required drivers are loaded and remote database export functionality works as expected.
- CSCtk52607 - ACS 5.2 high memory usage - more than 90%
The fix is in setting the upper and lower limits for the Sybase cache size by using the -ch and -cl parameters in the command line, when starting the
Sybase Database. This reduces the memory usage.
- CSCtq94551 - After saving Port filter and Device name reversed
The fix makes the Device Name and Port to be stored in the appropriate fields.
- CSCtq93902 - ACS1121// Port filters not working properly.
Customer is using Device Port Filters to filter the NDG. Under the device name tab, When trying to save the port details as ANY the
records are not saved and no error message is generated.With this fix, the device name and port details are saved even when the port
data is configured as ANY.
- CSCtr95901 Remote DataBase sql schema need to change for export run failed
The issue is addressed by changing the existing column datatypes in schemafiles.
- CSCtq69032 Re-submitting Remote Database Configuration creates an extra instance
This fix address the issue of remote database export failure due to another job instance running.
when the user tries to do sumbit on remote db configuration page by chaning any of the previously configured value or with out changing any value also there is a new pop message shown with "Ok" or "cancel" option. If Ok is selected,then the existing configuration is creared and it is configured with new values.If cancel is selected,then previous configuration values are retainded .This fix also cleans up the temp file created for previous remote export run.
- CSCts17763 ACS may crash when Shell Profile name contains specialcharacters
This fix addresses the ACS Runtime crash issue when Shell Authorization Profile contains non-English characters.
- CSCtr32335 Secondary node fails to register to the primary with a huge DB, could be a duplicate of
CSCtr32120 - Replication is not working for large amount of Data
The fix introduces a new replication mechanism based on dbunload utility instead of dbbackup: the only data is being replicated, not entire DB file which can contain a considerable amount of fragmented free space for large databases.
- CSCtr32511 Sybase transaction log file acsxxxx.log grows infinitely
The fix includes the DB transaction log management. The transaction log is truncated on each check-point (-m option).
- CSCts38010 ACS Runtime crash during processing of TACACS+ request
The fix addresses incorrect authentication session cleanup when closing the T+connection at ACS side after configuration change. Following sequencereproduces the issue.
1. A T+ connection has been established and the authentication session was started by device.
2. ACS (secondary) got a configuration change.
3. Device dropped the connection.
4. ACS crashed when closing the connection and cleaning the session.
- CSCto11378 ACS 5.2 AD pre-authentication failures for AD with sAMAccountName format
We just set a new flag (called salt) in the centrifydc.conf file.This increases Centrifys compatibility with Windows 2008 and
solves someuse cases where usernames would fail authentication (when they should not).
- CSCtr01798 Import updates unchanged records causing transaction log growth
Unchanged Records are not executed.
- CSCtr77850 ACS does not try next GC if LDAP service is not available
In case there are several global catalogues, ACS checks the global catalogue status and chooses to work only against available GC.
- CSCtr86413 ACS incremental configuration replication fails
This issue was related to the automatic mechanism of cleaning old Transaction.
- CSCtq76960 Can't Modify Internal User Password After Adding Enumerate-Type Attribute
After adding enum type attribute for user, there was an error modifying internal user password
- CSCtn06060 ACS5 inefficiently handles packets when EAP State attribute is invalid
If ACS5 receives authentication attempts containing invalid/unknown EAP State values, they are processed (instead of dropped like ACS4) crea ting a load on system resources which results in un-responsive behavior of the server in general when the numbers of these auths is high.
- CSCtq81172 Admin GUI excessive page load times for large NDG tree
This fix reduces the page load time when NDG has more childerns.
with this fix the tree loads collapsed and when the user expands the node then it retrieves the children of the expanded node.
Furthermore, in case that the the expanded node has a large amount of children then incremental loading of 50 by 50 nodes happens so the loading does not block
the page and doesnt take a long time.
Note: Due to architectural limitations once the user tries to use the filter of the tree, the tree will load in previous mode (full loading of the tree)
But in any case the filtering means a lower amount of nodes so the load operation will not take more time.
- CSCts60512 Core file generated under combined T+ and EAP-TLS authentications
This fix address the runtime crash occurance under the stress of T+ and EAP-TLS authentications
- CSCtt04461 Update csv file not working in Device type and location under NDG
With this fix the Update csv file for device type or location type via the import/export interface works as expected.
- CSCtr78192 Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco ACS 5 web interface
There is a new filter added to validate and redirect to error/logout page if any vulnerable (Cross Site Scripting) characters are found in the user request.
- CSCts85741 Possible SQL Injection point in ACS 5.2
This fix validates for any malicious characters which cause SQL Injection .
- CSCtr78143 Multiple Cross--Site Request Forgery and stored XSS in ACS 5.2.
There is new Mechanism added to prevent CSRF, if there is any request with CSRF then it is redirected to error page.
- CSCtu02752 ACS 5.2 patch 8 cannot display long lists of NDGs ( Duplicate of CSCtu04594)
- CSCtu04594 ACS 5.2.0.26.7 - only 50 NDGs shown on GUI with more than 100 configured
All the configured NDGS are displayed as expected.
- CSCtu06690 ACS network device display filter broken big time
The filter and the count displayed while applying the filter in network device page shows the count properly and shows the proper devices.
CSCtu89783 ACS 5 password expiration policy triggered for token user
The fix disable password expiration policy for Users, what defined to do authentication in External ID Store (through ACS-RESERVED-Authen-ID-Store attribute ).
- CSCtg51846 Enum values are not shown in compound conditions in rule
It is now possible under the compound condition in the policy table to add values that reference a string enum attribute value.
- CSCtt14745 Cannot add group to LDAP identity store
- CSCtt17019 ACS5.x-Issue retrieving additional AD groups when referenced in rules
The fix uses the correct element and now it is possible to add additional groups under 'Directory Groups' tab in LDAP and AD.
- CSCtt21122 Cannot import command sets with slash '/' in argument
with this fix ,the command set arguments containing '/' char are imported and the values are shown properly.
- CSCto95888 sh acs-logs details cmd does not display localstore log file name
The changes has been made for "show acs-logs" or "show acs-logs details" command, to display all the logs under localstore even When more number of acsLocalStore.log files are generated.
- CSCtw64212 'view-logprocessor' Process stuck in 'not monitored
This fix replaces the inmemroy database with clean db file and starts which brings up the view-logprocessor, In scenarios where view-logprocessor is going to not monitored state due to the curruption inmemory database.
- CSCte39351 ACS appliance snmp agent process daemon stops
A cron job command is used to monitor snmpd process. If the snmpd process is stopped, the shell script present in snmp-status file is executed which makes the snmpd process to be restarted.
CSCtu36357 ACS 5 cannot duplicate user account
This fix address the duplicate user issue where in UserIsInManagementHeirarchy or HostIsInManagementHeirarchy attributes were configured to Internal users or Hosts dictionary.
CSCtw56498 TACACS+ "enable" request is dropped on unknown authen\_type
The fix allows ACS to handle TACACS+ "enable" requests with any authen\_type value. The TACACS+ "enable" requests with unknown authen\_type values will be handled as TACACS+ "enable" requests with authen\_type=ASCII
CSCtw67208 Administrative and Operational Audit logs not getting recorded on ACS (Duplicate of CSCto88134)
CSCto88134 Temporary table was missing in 5.2 db after restoring 5.1 backup
This fix prevents the occurance of the xml parse expcetpions during any configuration changes that has been done in scenario where ACS has been upgraded from ACS 5.1 to ACS5.2 or restored the backup taken in ACS5.1 into ACS 5.2 . This fix also prevents the administrative and Operational Audit logging issue occured because of xml parse exception.
CSCtu21456 ACS 5 intermittently password change is not working in on secondary ACS
The issue happens when device admin changes their password with T+ and the new password contains invalid characters. Following the change password failure no device admin is able to change password.
CSCtx19470 ACS5 runtime error while try GUI login but all processes are running
The issue occurs under certain combination of T+ connection load so that the ACS runtime service is stuck though displayed as 'running' in the process status. During that, T+ authentications are timed out and GUI login is throwing an error.
CSCtx68133 VA:Some of Secondary machines are going offline when the setup is idle
In case of certain failures within the messaging communication among ACS nodes, the messaging communication mechanism is restarted.
This auto recovery functionality keeps high reliability of ACS distribution environment .
