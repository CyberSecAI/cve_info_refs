Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3034:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a "Use-after-free" vulnerability in the handling of SVG documents within WebKit. This means that the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to potential issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary weakness is a use-after-free condition, which occurs when the program attempts to access memory that has been deallocated or freed. This typically happens when a pointer to a memory location is still held after the memory is released.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unexpected Application Termination:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to an unexpected application termination or crash.
*  **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application. This would enable the attacker to take complete control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Website:** The primary attack vector is through visiting a website that is specifically crafted to trigger this vulnerability.
*   **WebKit:** The vulnerability resides in WebKit, the browser engine used by Safari, Chrome, and other applications.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the targeted system. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely via a specially crafted website.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs the ability to serve or host a malicious website that a user would visit.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker requires technical knowledge of WebKit internals and how to trigger use-after-free vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is associated with multiple other memory corruption issues in WebKit.
*   This CVE is fixed in Safari 6, iOS 6 and iTunes 10.7
*   Google Chrome also patched this vulnerability
*   This issue is associated with SVG document handling
