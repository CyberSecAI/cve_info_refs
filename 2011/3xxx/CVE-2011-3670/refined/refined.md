```
Root cause of vulnerability:
  - Firefox was interpreting web addresses with square brackets around the host in a non-standard way. It would try to interpret the host as a regular domain name if not a valid IPv6 literal address.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Incorrect parsing of IPv6 URLs
  - Firefox was not enforcing RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax.
  - Failure to properly handle IPv6 addresses in the context of HTTP proxies.
  - Same-Origin Policy (SOP) allowed XMLHttpRequest to access proxy error messages.

Impact of exploitation:
  - Disclosure of sensitive information from proxy error messages
  - User privacy could be eroded.
  - Possibility of reading HttpOnly cookies in XSS situations.

Attack vectors:
  - Making requests using IPv6 syntax through a proxy via XMLHttpRequest objects.
  - Visiting a malicious website that crafts specific URLs.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - The attacker needs to craft a URL with the non-standard IPv6 format and trick the user into making a request through a configured proxy.
