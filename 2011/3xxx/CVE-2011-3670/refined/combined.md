SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla XULrunner
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:0198-1
Rating: important
References: #737533 #744275
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Software Development Kit 11 SP1
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1 for VMware
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 11 SP1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes one version update.
Description:
Mozilla XULrunner was updated to 1.9.2.26 security update,
fixing security issues and bugs. The following security
bugs have been fixed:
\*
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
\*
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported
memory safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10
and Firefox 3.6.26.
\*
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons
Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If
this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox
attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name.
Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6
syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may
generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6.
The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0,
Thunderbird 7.0, and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in
Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
\*
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
under certain circumstances because of a premature
notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free
of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding
and has the potential for remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers
Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that
when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there
is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
a possibility of remote code execution.

Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3670 CVE-2012-0442 CVE-2012-0444 CVE-2012-0449

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, Debian's
variant of the Mozilla Thunderbird code base.

CVE-2011-3670
	Icedove does not not properly enforce the IPv6 literal address
	syntax, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
	information by making XMLHttpRequest calls through a proxy and
	reading the error messages.

CVE-2012-0442
	Memory corruption bugs could cause Icedove to crash or
  	possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2012-0444
	Icedove does not properly initialize nsChildView data
	structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a crafted Ogg Vorbis file.

CVE-2012-0449
	Icedove allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
	(memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute
	arbitrary code via a malformed XSLT stylesheet that is
	embedded in a document

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze7.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

SUSE Security Update: Security update for Mozilla Firefox
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: SUSE-SU-2012:0221-1
Rating: important
References: #744275
Affected Products:
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10 SP4
SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 10 SP4
SLE SDK 10 SP4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to 3.6.26 fixing bugs and
security issues.
The following security issues have been fixed by this
update:
\*
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through
email in the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because
scripting is disabled, but are potentially a risk in
browser or browser-like contexts in those products.
References
\*
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported
memory safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10
and Firefox 3.6.26.
\*
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons
Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If
this host was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox
attempted to interpret the host as a regular domain name.
Gregory Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6
syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may
generate errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6.
The resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0,
Thunderbird 7.0, and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in
Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
\*
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed
under certain circumstances because of a premature
notification of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free
of the child nodes could possibly allow for for remote code
execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher
regenrecht reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
the possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of
Ogg Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding
and has the potential for remote code execution.
\*
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers
Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that
when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet,
Firefox can crash due to a memory corruption. While there
is no evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is
a possibility of remote code execution.
Indications:
Please install this update.
Special Instructions and Notes:
Please reboot the system after installing this update.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686 (x86\_64); en-US; rv:1.9.0.11) Gecko/2009060214 Firefox/3.0.11
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86\_64; en-US; rv:1.9.1.1pre) Gecko/20090713 Shiretoko/3.5.1pre
In Firefox, it is possible to make requests using IPv6 syntax (http://[example.com]/) via XMLHttpRequest objects. If an HTTP proxy has been configured, the request will be handled by the proxy.
Depending on the proxy implementation a number of possible errors may occur. For example, the proxy may not be prepared to handle the IPv6 syntax and will incorrectly parse the request leading to an error.
Error messages from HTTP proxies often include sensitive network diagnostic information such as client IP addresses, internal hostnames, email addresses and possibly a copy of the HTTP request.
Because <http://example.com/> and http://[example.com]/ are same origin, the XMLHttpRequest object can be used to read this information from the response.
A remote site may be able to construct such requests in order to reduce a user's privacy. Additionally, if a copy of the HTTP request is included in the error response, it may be possible to read cookies marked as HttpOnly in XSS situations.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Configure HTTP proxy
2. Visit listed URL
3. Run test
Tested with squid-cache proxy (squid/3.0.STABLE16) with default configuration.

Why are we treating these two forms as same-origin? We don't treat a site and its IP address as same-origin, and we don't treat <http://accounting/> and <http://accounting.mycompany.com/> as same-origin. They might be, they probably are, but we don't \_know\_ so we don't. "example.com" and "[example.com]" should be handled the same way.
It's not just XHR, two windows/frames are treated as same-origin when they may not be if IPv6 is routed somewhere differently than the IPv4 version (due to a proxy or whatever reason).

Hmm. That happens because we separately compare host and port. And for http://[example.com]/ necko reports "example.com" as the host, but "[example.com]" as the hostPort.
It should probably report [example.com] as the host, no?

http://[example.com] is not valid syntax for anything...

So does this bug morph into "enforce valid rfc3986 syntax"? That would solve the initial proxy abuse problem and the same-origin issue by simply disallowing such URIs. While we're at it we should fix IPv4 addresses to follow the spec an disallow malformed numerics (e.g. <http://1249763378/> is invalid and should not go to Google as an alias for <http://74.125.224.50/>)

This isn't easy to do. I've also implemented net\_IsValidIPv4Addr() and tried to filter out any invalid IPv4/IPv6 address in nsHostResolver::ResolveHost() (<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/8fff6db8b016/netwerk/dns/nsHostResolver.cpp#l538>). But the same "invalid" conversion is done by system's getaddrinfo(). So if we really don't want to interpret hostname 1249763378 as IP address 74.125.224.50, we can't call PR\_GetAddrInfoByName(). But IMO (I can be wrong) we can't block URIs like <http://123/> because 123 can be valid NetBIOS name. Also if there is some search domain in the system, it can be resolved as 123.domain.

I seem to recall this being the Necko way, handing around raw pointers and stuff like this. But must it be? I bet many people would be happier if the data were passed along in some way that provided debug-build bounds-checking. A dependent string or similar would give this to you.

Explicitly specified length, except when it's not? Ugh.

That has two benefits:
1) It describes what the patch actually does.
2) It does not leak information about the security issue.

Given that the only caller so far has the length, I think we should make the length required and not compute it here.

Now that we can, please make this a mozilla::RangePtr.

Maybe haveZeros? Otherwise it ends up looking like a counter akin to digits/colons/blocks, not a boolean.

I think you can move the |colons++| out of the two cases its in and to the bottom of this block.
Alternately, you could replace the if cascade with a switch on colons++. Either way.

I don't believe this matches the RFC 3986 BNF. For example, this will disallow the following valid IPv6 address:
::192.168.1.1
(see the definition of "1s32" in section 3.2.2).
>+ if ((zeroes && blocks < 8) ||

Probably simpler as:

I really wish there were a way to make this more readable, but it's eluding me at the moment. :(
r- because the syntax this is enforcing is incomplete...

mozilla::RangedPtr is [bug 662001](/show_bug.cgi?id=662001 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement mozilla::RangedPtr"), only landed in TM at the moment. I'll land it in m-c singly, since it sounds like a TM->m-c merge is not immediately forthcoming (having just happened within a day or so).

I did not. There is absolutely no reason the patch description (which is a description of what changes are being made) should match a bug summary (which is a description of a problem). In fact, any time they match one or the other is probably wrong.

It's really number of '.' seen... In fact, I'd rename it to dotCount or something like that (and fix the comment).
>+ for (; addrLen-- ; p++) {
I'd prefer:
for (; addrLen; ++p, --addrLen)
to make it explicit what's test and what's loop increment. Since addrLen is
not used in the loop, this should be fine.
>+ if (octet<0 || octet>255) {
I believe this will fail in cases when enough overflow happens to wrap all the way around. It would be better to do the >255 check after the "multiply by 10 and add the digit" step. You would still need the <0 check here, but add spaces around the '<'.

As above.

The +1 would need to go away when addrLen is not modified until the increment step of the for loop.
r=me with those nits fixed.

You need to assign addr into p somewhere, e.g.
for (p=addr; addrLen; ++p, --addrLen)
And the same in net\_IsValidIPv6Addr().
Why didn't you include test\_bug504014.js in this backport patch?

@Greg, I'm not set up with any proxy server and I'm not technically inclined to do so. Would it be possible for you to verify the fix? If so you can use the following build:

> Depending on the proxy implementation a number of possible errors may occur.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2012-02

## Overly permissive IPv6 literal syntax

Announced
January 31, 2012
Reporter
Gregory Fleischer
Impact
Low
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.26
* Firefox 7
* SeaMonkey 2.4
* Thunderbird 3.1.18
* Thunderbird 7

### Description

For historical reasons Firefox has been generous in its interpretation of web
addresses containing square brackets around the host. If this host was not a
valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to interpret the host as a regular
domain name. **Gregory Fleischer** reported that requests made
using IPv6 syntax using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The resulting error messages
from the proxy may disclose sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will
allow the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages, allowing user
privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that
may break links written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.

This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0, and
SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and Thunderbird 3.1.18 during
2012.

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaFirefox: Version 10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2012:0234-1
Rating: important
References: #744275
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes 5 new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Firefox was updated to version 10 to fix bugs and
security issues.
MFSA 2012-01: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products. References
CVE-2012-0443: Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas,
Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der
Beken, and Bill McCloskey reported memory safety problems
that were fixed in Firefox 10.
CVE-2012-0442: Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary reported memory
safety problems that were fixed in both Firefox 10 and
Firefox 3.6.26.
MFSA 2012-02/CVE-2011-3670: For historical reasons Firefox
has been generous in its interpretation of web addresses
containing square brackets around the host. If this host
was not a valid IPv6 literal address, Firefox attempted to
interpret the host as a regular domain name. Gregory
Fleischer reported that requests made using IPv6 syntax
using XMLHttpRequest objects through a proxy may generate
errors depending on proxy configuration for IPv6. The
resulting error messages from the proxy may disclose
sensitive data because Same-Origin Policy (SOP) will allow
the XMLHttpRequest object to read these error messages,
allowing user privacy to be eroded. Firefox now enforces
RFC 3986 IPv6 literal syntax and that may break links
written using the non-standard Firefox-only forms that were
previously accepted.
This was fixed previously for Firefox 7.0, Thunderbird 7.0,
and SeaMonkey 2.4 but only fixed in Firefox 3.6.26 and
Thunderbird 3.1.18 during 2012.
MFSA 2012-03/CVE-2012-0445: Alex Dvorov reported that an
attacker could replace a sub-frame in another domain's
document by using the name attribute of the sub-frame as a
form submission target. This can potentially allow for
phishing attacks against users and violates the HTML5 frame
navigation policy.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-04/CVE-2011-3659: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that
removed child nodes of nsDOMAttribute can be accessed under
certain circumstances because of a premature notification
of AttributeChildRemoved. This use-after-free of the child
nodes could possibly allow for for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-05/CVE-2012-0446: Mozilla security researcher
moz\_bug\_r\_a4 reported that frame scripts bypass XPConnect
security checks when calling untrusted objects. This allows
for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages
and Firefox extensions. The fix enables the Script Security
Manager (SSM) to force security checks on all frame scripts.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-06/CVE-2012-0447: Mozilla developer Tim Abraldes
reported that when encoding images as
image/vnd.microsoft.icon the resulting data was always a
fixed size, with uninitialized memory appended as padding
beyond the size of the actual image. This is the result of
mImageBufferSize in the encoder being initialized with a
value different than the size of the source image. There is
the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory
being appended to a PNG image when converted fron an ICO
format image. This sensitive data may then be disclosed in
the resulting image.
Firefox 3.6 and Thunderbird 3.1 are not affected by this
vulnerability
MFSA 2012-07/CVE-2012-0444: Security researcher regenrecht
reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative the
possibility of memory corruption during the decoding of Ogg
Vorbis files. This can cause a crash during decoding and
has the potential for remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-08/CVE-2012-0449: Security researchers Nicolas
Gregoire and Aki Helin independently reported that when
processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox
can crash due to a memory corruption. While there is no
evidence that this is directly exploitable, there is a
possibility of remote code execution.
MFSA 2012-09/CVE-2012-0450: magicant starmen reported that
if a user chooses to export their Firefox Sync key the
"Firefox Recovery Key.html" file is saved with incorrect
permissions, making the file contents potentially readable
by other users on Linux and OS X systems.
Firefox 3.6 is not affected by this vulnerability.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |

| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
