Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-3585:

**Root Cause:**

*   A race condition exists in the `mount.cifs` and `umount.cifs` utilities. These utilities use a lock file (`/etc/mtab~`) while mounting or unmounting CIFS shares.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** The lock file is created *before* updating `/etc/mtab` and deleted *after* the operation. If the `mount.cifs` or `umount.cifs` process is terminated (e.g., by a signal) while the lock file exists but before `/etc/mtab` is updated, the stale lock file remains.
*   **setuid root:** The vulnerability is exploitable when `mount.cifs` and `umount.cifs` are setuid root. This allows unprivileged users to execute these utilities with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can cause subsequent CIFS share mount/umount requests to fail by creating a stale lock file. This can disrupt normal system operation that relies on network shares.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** An attacker needs local access to the system to send a termination signal to the `mount.cifs` or `umount.cifs` process at the right moment when the lock file exists.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
*   **Signal Sending:** The attacker must be able to send signals to the `mount.cifs` or `umount.cifs` processes.
*   **Timing:** The attacker must be able to time the signal sending such that the process terminates while the lock file is in place but before the `/etc/mtab` update occurs.
*   **`mount.cifs` and `umount.cifs` with setuid bit:** The utilities must be setuid root for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Red Hat states that `mount.cifs` and `umount.cifs` are *not* setuid root by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora distributions. Therefore, these distributions are not vulnerable *by default*.
