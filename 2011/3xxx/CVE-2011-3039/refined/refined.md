Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3039:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a **use-after-free** error within the WebKit component of iTunes, iOS, and Safari. This means that the program is attempting to access a memory location that has already been freed. Specifically, this issue occurs in the processing of quotes within WebKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Use-after-free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. This arises when memory is deallocated, and a subsequent operation attempts to access it. This leads to memory corruption and program instability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By exploiting this memory corruption, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the user's system. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system.
*   **Application termination:** Exploitation can also lead to unexpected termination of the application (iTunes, Safari, or other applications using WebKit).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** A primary attack vector is enticing the user to visit a specially crafted website. This website would contain malicious code designed to trigger the use-after-free vulnerability when processed by the vulnerable WebKit component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by hosting a malicious website, or injecting the malicious code into a legitimate site visited by the victim.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction, specifically, that the victim visits a maliciously crafted website using a vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources confirm the vulnerability exists in WebKit and list CVE-2011-3039 as a use-after-free in quote handling.
*   The vulnerability affects multiple Apple products that use WebKit, including iTunes, iOS, and Safari for OS X.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by improved memory handling in the respective updates for each of the affected products.
*  The vulnerability is rated as high severity in some sources.
