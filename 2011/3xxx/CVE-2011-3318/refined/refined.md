Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-3318:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of crafted Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) TCP packets in Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras. Specifically, sending a series of these crafted packets to an affected device can trigger the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper RTSP TCP packet processing leading to a denial of service.
- Lack of input validation on incoming RTSP packets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service condition where the camera stops sending video streams.
- The camera automatically reboots after the denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attack vector via network (both wired and wireless segments).
- Unauthenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered by sending specifically crafted RTSP TCP packets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the network (either wired or wireless) that the vulnerable camera is connected to.
- No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the capability to send crafted RTSP TCP packets.

**Additional details from the content compared to the CVE description:**
- The affected products are specifically Cisco Video Surveillance IP Cameras 2421, 2500 series, and 2600 series.
- The vulnerability can be triggered from both wired and wireless network segments.
- It explicitly mentions the automatic reboot of the camera after exploitation.
- It provides specific software releases that address the vulnerability for each affected camera series.
- It provides links to a mitigation document and associated Cisco Bug IDs.
