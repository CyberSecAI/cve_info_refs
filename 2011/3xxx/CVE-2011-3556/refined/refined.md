  "CVE-2011-3556": {
    "description": "Potential security vulnerabilities have been identified with HP Network Node Manager I (NNMi) running JDK for HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows. The vulnerabilities could be remotely exploited resulting in unauthorized information disclosure, modification, Denial of Service (DoS). It was discovered that RMI Registry implementation in OpenJDK did not properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code. A remote RMI client could use this flaw to execute code on the server with elevated privileges. It was found that RMI Registry implementation in OpenJDK did not properly restrict access to some of its methods. A remote client able to connect to the RMI Registry could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the server running the registry. RMI DGC server remote code execution (RMI, 7077466)",
    "vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the RMI Registry implementation in OpenJDK which doesn't properly restrict privileges for remotely executed code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control on RMI registry methods",
      "Missing privilege restrictions in RMI registry implementation",
      "Insecure handling of remotely executed code in RMI registry"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, leading to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote network connections to the RMI registry",
      "Exploitation of the RMI interface"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker with network access can exploit the vulnerable RMI interface.",
