        "data": "The vulnerability exists in the Deployment component of the Java Runtime Environment. It can be exploited remotely without authentication. Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, especially if the user is running the Java applet or Java Web Start application with administrator privileges (common on Windows). Where users don't have administrator privileges, the impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability is partial resulting in lower CVSS score. The vulnerability is triggered through untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets. The vulnerability affects JDK and JRE 6 Update 27 and earlier on Windows."
