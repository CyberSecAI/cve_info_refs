  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-3375",
      "root_cause": "For performance reasons, information parsed from a request is often cached in two places: the internal request object and the internal processor object. These objects are not recycled at exactly the same time. When certain errors occur that needed to be added to the access log, the access logging process triggers the re-population of the request object after it has been recycled. However, the request object was not recycled before being used for the next request.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect request caching"
      ],
      "impact": "Information leakage (e.g., remote IP address, HTTP headers) from the previous request to the next request.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious user can trigger a specific error during request processing, leading to information leakage.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a request that results in an error that triggers the access logging and re-population of the request object."
