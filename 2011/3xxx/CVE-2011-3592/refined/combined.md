| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=738681#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-15 14:17:28 UTC  ``` Multiple XSS flaws have been recently reported in the v3.4.4 version of phpMyAdmin (PMASA-2011-14):  [1] <http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/security/PMASA-2011-14.php>  1) An XSS flaw was found in the way phpMyAdmin processed row content,    containing JavaScript code, after its inline editing and saving,  2) It was found that phpMyAdmin did not properly sanitize the content    of db, table, and column names prior use of their values.  A remote attacker could use these flaws to conduct XSS attacks (execute arbitrary HTML or web script) by tricking authenticated phpMyAdmin user into visiting of a specially-crafted URL.  References: [2] <http://secunia.com/advisories/45991/>  Relevant upstream patches: [3] <http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=bda213c58aec44925be661acb0e76c19483ea170> [4] <http://phpmyadmin.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin;a=commitdiff;h=2f28ce9c800274190418da0945ce3647d36e1db6>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=738681#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-15 14:22:57 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the phpMyAdmin package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. Please schedule an update.  --  These issues affect the versions of the phpMyAdmin package, as present within EPEL-6 repository. Please schedule an update.  --  These issues do NOT affect the versions of the phpMyAdmin package, as present within EPEL-4 and EPEL-5 repositories. If I looked correctly, the relevant functionality isn't there yet. But Robert, please have look and confirm too, so we could be sure.  Thanks, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=738681#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-15 14:24:02 UTC  ``` Created phpMyAdmin tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 738685](show_bug.cgi?id=738685 "CLOSED ERRATA - phpMyAdmin: Multiple XSS flaws in versions v3.4.0 to v3.4.4 (PMASA-2011-14) [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-6 [[bug 738686](show_bug.cgi?id=738686 "CLOSED ERRATA - phpMyAdmin: Multiple XSS flaws in versions v3.4.0 to v3.4.4 (PMASA-2011-14) [epel-6]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=738681#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-15 14:28:46 UTC  ``` CVE Request: [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/15/2>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=738681#c4)  Robert Scheck    2011-09-18 00:32:52 UTC  ``` This also affects EPEL 5 (phpMyAdmin3).   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=738681#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-03 17:55:34 UTC  ``` Issue #1 (XSS flaw) received the name [CVE-2011-3591](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3591).

Use CVE-2011-3591

Use CVE-2011-3592

## PMASA-2011-14

**Announcement-ID:** PMASA-2011-14

**Date:** 2011-09-14

### Summary

Multiple XSS.

### Description

Firstly, if a row contains javascript code, after inline editing this row and saving, the code is executed. Secondly, missing sanitization on the db, table and column names leads to XSS vulnerabilities.

### Severity

We consider these vulnerabilities to be serious.

### Mitigation factor

An attacker must be logged in via phpMyAdmin to exploit this problem.

### Affected Versions

Versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.4 were found vulnerable.

### Solution

Upgrade to phpMyAdmin 3.4.5 or apply the related patches listed below.

### References

The first issue was found by Brad Bernard ([iunfollow.com](http://iunfollow.com)). The second issue was found by Nils Juenemann (<https://twitter.com/#!/totally_unknown>.)

CWE ids:
[CWE-661](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/661.html)
[CWE-98](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/98.html)
