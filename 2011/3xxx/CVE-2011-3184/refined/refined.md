Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the handling of HTTP 100 responses within the MSN protocol plugin of Pidgin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of HTTP 100 responses leading to an attempt to access invalid memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a crash of the Pidgin application (Denial of Service).
- It's explicitly stated that remote code execution is not possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires a malicious MSN server. It's mentioned that the vulnerability might only be triggerable by a malicious server and not a malicious peer.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the HTTP connection method is enabled for an account, which is off by default.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to operate a malicious MSN server that can send crafted HTTP 100 responses.
- The user must connect to this malicious server with the HTTP connection method enabled in Pidgin.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat does not consider this a security flaw due to the requirement of connecting to a malicious server which has broader implications than just a DoS.
- Upstream developers also acknowledged this is a crash-only issue.
- The issue affects Pidgin users who have enabled the HTTP connection method for their MSN accounts.

In summary, CVE-2011-3184 describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in Pidgin's MSN protocol plugin that can be triggered by a malicious server sending specific HTTP responses, leading to a crash due to invalid memory access.
