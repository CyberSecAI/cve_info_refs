How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

#define __sdpstats_seq_hist_pcpu(seq, msg, hist) ({             \
        u32 h[NR_CPUS];                                         \

        memset(h, 0, sizeof(h));                                \

NR_CPUS can be big (4096 on RHEL6@..._64) and the array is located on
the stack.

The array ^^^ is no longer allocated from the stack but via vmalloc().

Please use CVE-2011-3345.

Thanks!

So the issue is not actually the wrong array iterator, but that there
is a implicit too huge stack usage caused by the helper.

Subject: CVE Request: OFED 1.5.2 /proc/net/sdpstats reading local denial of service/crash

Hi,

One of our customers reported an issue in the "ib_sdp" module in the
ofa_kernel package of the Open Fabrics OFED Infiband driverstack, version
1.5.2 (and potentially older, I did not check in detail, at least 1.4.2
does not have it).

Module is drivers/infiniband/ulp/sdp/ib_sdp.ko

/proc/net/sdpstats is user readable (S_IRUGO | S_IWUGO), so it can be
triggered by users on machines with infiniband stack.

While there is report of stack corruption and overflow on process (cat
/proc/net/sdpstats) exit ("Thread overran stack, or stack corrupted"),
I can't see where it actually comes from but perhaps the per_cpu vs
single variable printing does something to the stack and not just reads
over arrays.

ofed 1.5.3.2 has a different stat printing algorith according to our developer,
so it no longer is affected.

Patch below. Please assign a CVE.

Ciao, Marcus

From: Goldwyn Rodrigues <rgoldwyn@...e.de>
Subject: [PATCH] Correct /proc/net/sdpstats variables

A couple of variables are treated as arrays while printing
/proc/net/sdpstats, while they are actually single variables.
This leads to stack/memory corruption and a kernel crash.
Correct dealing of these variables in sdpstats_seq_show()
