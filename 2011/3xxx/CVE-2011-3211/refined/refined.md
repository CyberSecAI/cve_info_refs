  "CVE-2011-3211": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "Multiple Sources",
      "Curation_Date": "2024-01-26",
      "Curation_Status": "Complete"
    },
    "Vulnerability_Description": "The bcfg2 server, a configuration management server for bcfg2 clients, is not properly sanitizing input from bcfg2 clients before passing it to various shell commands. This enables an attacker in control of a bcfg2 client to execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges.",
    "Affected_Product": "bcfg2",
    "Root_Cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of input received from bcfg2 clients before being used in shell commands on the server.",
    "Vulnerability": [
      {
        "Weakness": "Improper Input Sanitization",
        "Description": "The bcfg2 server does not properly sanitize input received from clients before using it in shell commands, leading to command injection vulnerability.",
		"Impact": "An attacker controlling a bcfg2 client can execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges.",
        "Attack_Vector": "Remote, through a compromised bcfg2 client.",
        "Required_Capabilities": "An attacker needs control of a bcfg2 client machine that is configured to connect to the vulnerable bcfg2 server.",
        "Additional_Details": "The vulnerability exists because the server directly uses client-provided data within shell commands without escaping or sanitizing it. This allows the injection of malicious shell commands by a client."
      }
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to gain root privileges on the bcfg2 server.",
	"Attack_Vector": "The attack vector is remote, via a compromised bcfg2 client.",
    "Required_Capabilities": "The attacker needs to have control of a bcfg2 client machine which has an established connection to the vulnerable bcfg2 server and have the SSHbase plugin enabled on the server.",
    "Additional_Information": {
        "Debian_Specific": "This is not a Debian-specific vulnerability. It affects all versions of bcfg2 where input sanitization is missing.",
         "Affected_Versions": "All released stable versions of the bcfg2-server contain several cases where data from the client is used in a shell command without properly escaping it first. Fixed in versions: 0.9.5.7-1.1+lenny1, 1.0.1-3+squeeze1, and 1.1.2-2."
