How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : bcfg2
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 640028
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3211

It has been discovered that the bcfg2 server, a configuration management
server for bcfg2 clients, is not properly sanitizing input from bcfg2
clients before passing it to various shell commands.  This enables an
attacker in control of a bcfg2 client to execute arbitrary commands on
the server with root privileges.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5.7-1.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-3+squeeze1

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your bcfg2 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: Unescaped shell command vulnerabilities
Date: Thu, 01 Sep 2011 19:25:12 +0300
```
Package: bcfg2-server
Version: 1.1.2-1
Severity: critical
Tags: security pending patch

All released stable versions of the bcfg2-server contain several cases
where data from the client is used in a shell command without properly
escaping it first. The 1.2 prerelease series has been fixed.

At least the SSHbase plugin has been confirmed as being exploitable.
This is a remote root hole, which requires that the SSHbase plugin is
enabled and that the attacker has control of a bcfg2 client machine.

See
<https://github.com/solj/bcfg2/commit/f4a35efec1b6a1e54d61cf1b8bfc83dd1d89eef7>
for the original security fix, and
<https://github.com/solj/bcfg2/commit/46795ae451ca6ede55a0edeb726978aef4684b53>
for the backport to the 1.1 series.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request for bcfg2 (remote root)

Hi,

A bug report in Debian has come to light for which I can find no other
information, and therefore I do not believe it has a CVE - but probably
should.

From <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=640028> :

"All released stable versions of the bcfg2-server contain several cases
where data from the client is used in a shell command without properly
escaping it first. The 1.2 prerelease series has been fixed.

"At least the SSHbase plugin has been confirmed as being exploitable.
This is a remote root hole, which requires that the SSHbase plugin is
enabled and that the attacker has control of a bcfg2 client machine."

A patch for the problem has been commited [1] upstream and backported [2] to
the 1.1 series.

1: <https://github.com/solj/bcfg2/commit/f4a35efec1b6a1e54d61cf1b8bfc83dd1d89eef7>
2: <https://github.com/solj/bcfg2/commit/46795ae451ca6ede55a0edeb726978aef4684b53>

Please CC me, I am not subscribed.

Thanks,

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=736279#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-07 09:07:31 UTC  ``` It was found that bcfg2 configuration management server did not properly escape shell commands data, provided by remote bcfg2 client, prior their execution, when the SSHbase plug-in was enabled. A remote attacker, able to control the client bcfg2 machine, could use this flaw to escalate their privileges (execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the bcfg2 server).

Please schedule an update.  This issue affects the versions of the bcfg2 package, as present within EPEL-5 and EPEL-6 repositories. Please schedule an update.  --  For bcfg2 package version, as present within EPEL-4 repository, it is not definitely clear, if this version is affected (the relevant code is slightly different in that version, so if affected, aforementioned upstream patches [4], [5] would need to be backported to older 0.9.6 version, present in EPEL-4).  Jeffrey, for EPEL-4 could you please have a look && confirm if EPEL-4 bcfg2 version is affected by this issue or not? And if affected, could you schedule an update / rebase for EPEL-4 version too?  Thanks, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=736279#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-07 09:15:50 UTC  ``` Created bcfg2 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 736281](show_bug.cgi?id=736281 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3211 bcfg2 (bcfg2-server): Privilege escalation due to improper escaping of shell command data sent from client, when SSHbase plug-in enabled [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=736279#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-07 09:18:18 UTC  ``` Created bcfg2 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-all [[bug 736282](show_bug.cgi?id=736282 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3211 bcfg2 (bcfg2-server): Privilege escalation due to improper escaping of shell command data sent from client, when SSHbase plug-in enabled [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=736279#c4)  Fabian Affolter    2011-09-07 21:46:49 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 735237](show_bug.cgi?id=735237 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - bcfg2: unescaped shell commands can lead to arbitrary code execution") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=736279#c5)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-09 21:01:01 UTC  ``` bcfg2-1.1.3-1.el5 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 5 stable repository.
