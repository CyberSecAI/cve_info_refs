- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper user authentication handling in WebDAV Sharing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user with a valid account on the server or one of its bound directories could cause the execution of arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors**: By exploiting the vulnerability in WebDAV Sharing, a local user with a valid account can execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a local user with a valid account on the server or one of its bound directories.
