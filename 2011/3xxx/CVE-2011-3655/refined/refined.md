Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3655:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Mozilla Firefox, SeaMonkey, and Thunderbird handle `NoWaiverWrappers`. These wrappers were introduced in Firefox 4 to restrict privileges, but a privilege check within the browser failed to respect these wrappers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Privilege Check:** The core issue is that the internal privilege check did not properly account for the restrictions imposed by `NoWaiverWrappers`. This allowed code that should have been restricted to potentially gain elevated privileges.
- **Bypass of Security Mechanism:** The vulnerability allows a bypass of the intended security mechanism of `NoWaiverWrappers`, which were designed to limit the capabilities of untrusted content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By bypassing the `NoWaiverWrappers`, attackers could gain elevated privileges allowing them to execute malicious code within the browser's environment.
- **Elevated Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows code running with limited permissions to gain higher level access. This could lead to a variety of attacks including data theft, system compromise, or further attacks on other users or systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Content:** The attack vector involves malicious web content. An attacker could embed malicious JavaScript or other code into a web page that, when loaded in a vulnerable browser, would exploit the flaw.
- **Browser Interaction:** A user visiting a compromised website or a website hosting malicious code would trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web Server Access or Malicious Content Injection:** Attackers would need to control a website or be able to inject malicious content into a website that users visit.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** Attackers would require knowledge of this vulnerability and how to exploit it.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug report ([Bug 674182](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=674182)) mentions that this is a regression introduced with the implementation of compartments.
-  The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 8, SeaMonkey 2.5, and Thunderbird 8.
- The vulnerability is described as "critical" due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
- A test case was created to reproduce the vulnerability and a patch was developed to address the flaw.

In summary, CVE-2011-3655 is a critical security vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution by bypassing security restrictions within the browser's code, making it essential to apply the relevant updates.
