Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3376:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a missing check in `DefaultInstanceManager.java` regarding access to the Manager application's servlets. The servlets implementing the Manager application functionality were not properly restricted to only privileged web applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Untrusted web applications were able to access and utilize the functionality of the Manager application.
- **Missing Access Control:** The code failed to properly restrict access to ContainerServlets to privileged contexts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could obtain information on running web applications.
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could deploy additional web applications, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Control of the Server:** An attacker could use the Manager application to modify settings and configurations.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious (untrusted) web application, deployed on the same Tomcat instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to deploy a web application on the vulnerable Tomcat server.
- The vulnerable Tomcat server needs to be running in a shared environment or with untrusted web applications.
- No specific user privileges or credentials needed to exploit other than the ability to deploy web apps.

**Technical Details:**

- The fix involves adding a check within `DefaultInstanceManager.java` to throw a `SecurityException` if a `ContainerServlet` is being accessed from a non-privileged context.
- This ensures that `ContainerServlet` instances, which include servlets from the Manager application are always restricted and prevents access by untrusted web applications.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided information includes the commit diff, which clarifies the location of the vulnerability and how it was fixed.
- It also indicates that this vulnerability is only applicable in shared hosting environments.
