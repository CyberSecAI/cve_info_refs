  "CVE-2011-3365": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "Input validation failure in KSSL (kdelibs) which allows for spoofing of the certificate's common name by including rich text in the certificate fields.",
    "root_cause": "The default rendering type for a QLabel is QLabel::AutoText, which uses heuristics to determine whether to render the given content as plain text or rich text. When displaying a security dialog with a certificate, KSSL does not properly force its QLabels to use QLabel::PlainText.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Input validation failure"
    ],
    "impact": "Exploitation may trick the user into believing a certificate is legitimate when in fact it is invalid, and simply displayed incorrectly.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A certificate containing a common name (CN) that has a table element"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to be able to generate or modify a certificate to include rich text in the certificate fields"
     ]
