  "CVE-2011-3547": {
    "description": "An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the Java2D code use for performing transformations of graphical shapes and images.  An untrusted Java application or applet, or a specially crafted input for the trusted Java application, could cause application crash or lead to code execution. Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the IcedTea JDK. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details. Multiple OpenJDK 6 and IcedTea-Web vulnerabilities have been fixed.  This update corrects several security vulnerabilities in the IBM Java Runtime Environment shipped as part of Red Hat Network Satellite Server 5.4. In a typical operating environment, these are of low security risk as the runtime is not used on untrusted applets. Several flaws were fixed in the IBM Java 2 Runtime Environment. An integer overflow vulnerability existed in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. It was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious input.",
