| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-30 12:21:01 UTC  ``` Deepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP) implementation in the IcedTea project Web browser plugin.  A malicious applet could use this flaw to bypass SOP protection and open connections to any sub-domain of the second-level domain of the applet's origin, as well as any sub-domain of the domain that is the suffix of the origin second-level domain.  For example, IcedTea-Web plugin allowed applet from some.host.example.com to connect to other.host.example.com, www.example.com, and example.com, as well as www.ample.com or ample.com.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 10:07:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 526854](attachment.cgi?id=526854&action=diff "Proposed patch from Deepak / Omair") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=526854&action=edit "Proposed patch from Deepak / Omair") Proposed patch from Deepak / Omair   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-25 20:37:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 530174](attachment.cgi?id=530174&action=diff "patch to correct the flaw in IcedTea-Web") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=530174&action=edit "patch to correct the flaw in IcedTea-Web") patch to correct the flaw in IcedTea-Web  This is the patch that will be used in the upstream release.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-02 14:31:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 531362](attachment.cgi?id=531362&action=diff "patch for icedtea6 1.8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=531362&action=edit "patch for icedtea6 1.8") patch for icedtea6 1.8   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c7)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-02 14:31:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 531363](attachment.cgi?id=531363&action=diff "patch for icedtea6 1.9") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=531363&action=edit "patch for icedtea6 1.9") patch for icedtea6 1.9   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-08 17:45:47 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://dbhole.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/icedtea-web-1-0-6-and-1-1-4-security-releases-released/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-11-08 21:56:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1441 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1441.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-30 12:21:01 UTC  ``` Deepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP) implementation in the IcedTea project Web browser plugin.  A malicious applet could use this flaw to bypass SOP protection and open connections to any sub-domain of the second-level domain of the applet's origin, as well as any sub-domain of the domain that is the suffix of the origin second-level domain.  For example, IcedTea-Web plugin allowed applet from some.host.example.com to connect to other.host.example.com, www.example.com, and example.com, as well as www.ample.com or ample.com.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 10:07:03 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 526854](attachment.cgi?id=526854&action=diff "Proposed patch from Deepak / Omair") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=526854&action=edit "Proposed patch from Deepak / Omair") Proposed patch from Deepak / Omair   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c5)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-25 20:37:02 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 530174](attachment.cgi?id=530174&action=diff "patch to correct the flaw in IcedTea-Web") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=530174&action=edit "patch to correct the flaw in IcedTea-Web") patch to correct the flaw in IcedTea-Web  This is the patch that will be used in the upstream release.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c6)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-02 14:31:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 531362](attachment.cgi?id=531362&action=diff "patch for icedtea6 1.8") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=531362&action=edit "patch for icedtea6 1.8") patch for icedtea6 1.8   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c7)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-02 14:31:45 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 531363](attachment.cgi?id=531363&action=diff "patch for icedtea6 1.9") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=531363&action=edit "patch for icedtea6 1.9") patch for icedtea6 1.9   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c8)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-08 17:45:47 UTC  ``` This is now public:  <http://dbhole.wordpress.com/2011/11/08/icedtea-web-1-0-6-and-1-1-4-security-releases-released/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=742515#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-11-08 21:56:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1441 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1441.html>   ``` |  |

## Details

Deepak Bhole discovered a flaw in the Same Origin Policy (SOP)

implementation in the IcedTea web browser plugin. This could allow a

remote attacker to open connections to certain hosts that should

not be permitted. ([CVE-2011-3377](/security/CVE-2011-3377))

Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong discovered that the block-wise AES

encryption algorithm block-wise as used in TLS/SSL was vulnerable to

a chosen-plaintext attack. This could allow a remote attacker to view

confidential data. ([CVE-2011-3389](/security/CVE-2011-3389))

It was discovered that a type confusion flaw existed in the in

the Internet Inter-Orb Protocol (IIOP) deserialization code. A

remote attacker could use this to cause an untrusted application

or applet to execute arbitrary code by deserializing malicious

input. ([CVE-2011-3521](/security/CVE-2011-3521))

It was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform

SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause

an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with

the full privileges of the JVM. ([CVE-2011-3544](/security/CVE-2011-3544))

It was discovered that the InputStream class used a global buffer to

store input bytes skipped. An attacker could possibly use this to gain

access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-3547](/security/CVE-2011-3547))

It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the AWTKeyStroke

class. A remote attacker could cause an untrusted application or applet

to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3548](/security/CVE-2011-3548))

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed

in the TransformHelper class in the Java2D implementation. A remote

attacker could use this cause a denial of service via an application

or applet crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3551](/security/CVE-2011-3551))

It was discovered that the default number of available UDP sockets for

applications running under SecurityManager restrictions was set too

high. A remote attacker could use this with a malicious application or

applet exhaust the number of available UDP sockets to cause a denial

of service for other applets or applications running within the same

JVM. ([CVE-2011-3552](/security/CVE-2011-3552))

It was discovered that Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) could

incorrectly expose a stack trace. A remote attacker could potentially

use this to gain access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-3553](/security/CVE-2011-3553))

It was discovered that the unpacker for pack200 JAR files did not

sufficiently check for errors. An attacker could cause a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code through a specially crafted

pack200 JAR file. ([CVE-2011-3554](/security/CVE-2011-3554))

It was discovered that the RMI registration implementation did not

properly restrict privileges of remotely executed code. A remote

attacker could use this to execute code with elevated privileges.

([CVE-2011-3556](/security/CVE-2011-3556), [CVE-2011-3557](/security/CVE-2011-3557))

It was discovered that the HotSpot VM could be made to crash, allowing

an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive

information. ([CVE-2011-3558](/security/CVE-2011-3558))

It was discovered that the HttpsURLConnection class did not

properly perform SecurityManager checks in certain situations. This

could allow a remote attacker to bypass restrictions on HTTPS

connections. ([CVE-2011-3560](/security/CVE-2011-3560))

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A1441)

## Topic

Updated icedtea-web packages that fix one security issue are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The IcedTea-Web project provides a Java web browser plug-in and an
implementation of Java Web Start, which is based on the Netx project. It
also contains a configuration tool for managing deployment settings for the
plug-in and Web Start implementations.

A flaw was found in the same-origin policy implementation in the
IcedTea-Web browser plug-in. A malicious Java applet could use this flaw to
open network connections to hosts other than the originating host,
violating the same-origin policy. (CVE-2011-3377)

All IcedTea-Web users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
upgrade IcedTea-Web to version 1.0.6 to correct this issue. Web browsers
using the IcedTea-Web browser plug-in must be restarted for this update to
take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Package        : openjdk-6
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3377 CVE-2011-3563 CVE-2011-5035 CVE-2012-0497
    	       	 CVE-2012-0501 CVE-2012-0502 CVE-2012-0503 CVE-2012-0505
		 CVE-2012-0506 CVE-2012-0507

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform.

CVE-2011-3377
	The Iced Tea browser plugin included in the openjdk-6 package
	does not properly enforce the Same Origin Policy on web content
	served under a domain name which has a common suffix with the
	required domain name.

CVE-2011-3563
	The Java Sound component did not properly check for array
	boundaries.  A malicious input or an untrusted Java application
	or applet could use this flaw to cause Java Virtual Machine to
	crash or disclose portion of its memory.

CVE-2011-5035
	The OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an
	excessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial
	of service vulnerability involving hash collisions.

CVE-2012-0497
	It was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics
	rendering objects before passing them to the native renderer.
	This could lead to JVM crash or Java sandbox bypass.

CVE-2012-0501
	The ZIP central directory parser used by java.util.zip.ZipFile
	entered an infinite recursion in native code when processing a
	crafted ZIP file, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2012-0502
	A flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager class that
	could allow untrusted Java applets to acquire keyboard focus
	and possibly steal sensitive information.

CVE-2012-0503
	The java.util.TimeZone.setDefault() method lacked a security
	manager invocation, allowing an untrusted Java application or
	applet to set a new default time zone.

CVE-2012-0505
	The Java serialization code leaked references to serialization
	exceptions, possibly leaking critical objects to untrusted
	code in Java applets and applications.

CVE-2012-0506
	It was discovered that CORBA implementation in Java did not
	properly protect repository identifiers (that can be obtained
	using _ids() method) on certain Corba objects.  This could
	have been used to perform modification of the data that should
	have been immutable.

CVE-2012-0507
	The AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly
	check if the array is of an expected Object[] type.  A
	malicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to
	cause Java Virtual Machine to crash or bypass Java sandbox
	restrictions

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.13-0+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b24-1.11.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.
