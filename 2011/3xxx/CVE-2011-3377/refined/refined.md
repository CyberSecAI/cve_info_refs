Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-3377:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in a flaw within the Same Origin Policy (SOP) implementation of the IcedTea-Web browser plugin. Specifically, the plugin improperly handles domain suffixes and second-level subdomains when enforcing the SOP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is a Same Origin Policy (SOP) bypass. The IcedTea-Web plugin fails to correctly restrict network connections based on the origin of the applet.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit allows a malicious Java applet to bypass SOP restrictions, enabling it to:
- Open network connections to any subdomain of the second-level domain of the applet's origin.
- Open network connections to any subdomain of the domain that is the suffix of the origin's second-level domain.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves a malicious Java applet embedded in a webpage. A user visiting a webpage hosting such an applet would be vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to host or inject a malicious Java applet into a webpage. The user then needs to visit this page with a browser that uses the vulnerable IcedTea-Web plugin.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerability allowed an applet from a domain such as `some.host.example.com` to connect to:
*   `other.host.example.com`
*   `www.example.com`
*    `example.com`
*   `www.ample.com`
*    `ample.com`

This demonstrates the bypass, allowing connections to subdomains and suffix domains.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is described as having a "moderate impact".
*   Patches were released in IcedTea-Web versions 1.0.6 and 1.1.4.
*   Several Linux distributions, including Red Hat and Ubuntu, were affected and released security updates to address this issue.
* The bug was discovered by Deepak Bhole.
