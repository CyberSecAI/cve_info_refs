Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-3904:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Use-after-free vulnerability in bidi (bidirectional text) handling within the WebKit rendering engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* A memory management issue where a pointer to a freed memory location is accessed, leading to a use-after-free condition. This occurs specifically in the context of handling bidirectional text.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution if successfully exploited. Attackers can potentially take control of the browser process, allowing them to perform malicious actions on the user's system.

**Attack vectors:**
* The vulnerability can be triggered by rendering web content that involves the processing of bidirectional text in a specific way. This could be achieved via a maliciously crafted website or a malformed document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to get a user to load a specially crafted HTML page or document that triggers the vulnerable code path in bidi handling. This could be achieved via a phishing campaign or by injecting malicious content into a website.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by the Google Chrome Security Team (Inferno) and miaubiz.
* The fix was included in Chrome 16.0.912.63
