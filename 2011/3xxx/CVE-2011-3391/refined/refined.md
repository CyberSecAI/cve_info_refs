Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2011-3391:

**Verification:**

The provided content describes a security vulnerability in IBM Rational Build Forge, where client-side controls were used to restrict access to certain functionalities. This aligns with the general nature of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-3391 which is a security bypass via client side controls.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from relying solely on client-side (JavaScript) controls to restrict access to sensitive functions within the Rational Build Forge web application. Specifically, the "Export Key File" function lacked server-side access controls.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Client-Side Controls:** The primary weakness is the use of client-side JavaScript for access control. This is easily bypassed by modifying the HTML, removing disable attributes, and accessing restricted functionality.
    *   **Missing Server-Side Checks:** The "Export Key File" function lacked proper server-side authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to access and export the file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation allows low-privileged users to export the key file potentially containing sensitive information.
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** The ability to access restricted functions leads to an authorization bypass where low privileged users can access high privilege functionality.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Client-Side Manipulation:** Attackers can modify the client-side HTML (e.g., using browser developer tools) to remove the disabled attributes and gain access to the restricted functions.
    *   **Direct Access to Unprotected Functionality:** Attackers can directly invoke the "Export Key File" function, since it was not protected on the server-side.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Web Application Access:** The attacker needs to have a non-admin, low privileged user account with access to the Rational Build Forge web application.
    *   **Basic Web Skills:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of HTML and how to manipulate web pages (e.g., using browser developer tools) to bypass client-side controls.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided text explicitly states that "Testing identified that there was no server side controls applied to the Export Key File function."
* This vulnerability was addressed by adding appropriate checks for "EditSecurity permission" on the server-side.
