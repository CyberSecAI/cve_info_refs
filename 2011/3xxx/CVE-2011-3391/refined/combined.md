# PM38058: CLIENT SIDE VALIDATION OF SERVER SIDE SECURITY

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  The Rational Build Forge web application was found to use client
  side controls (JavaScript) to prevent the user from accessing
  certain application functionality under the Security sub-menu.
  It is possible to bypass client side controls by removing the
  disable attribute.

  Testing identified that there was no server side controls
  applied to the Export Key File function. A low level user can
  export this file.

  A low privileged non-admin user with access to the web
  application can modify the client side controls. This
  vulnerability may result in the disclosure of sensitive
  in-formation and potentially authorisation bypass. Testing
  performed allowed a low privileged user to export the key file,
  other similar vulnerabilities may exist within the application.

  ```

  in place.
