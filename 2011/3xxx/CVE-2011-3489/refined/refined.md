Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `RnaUtility.dll` handles the 32-bit size field within "rna" packets. Specifically, the DLL does not properly validate this size field, which leads to a `memset` zero overflow and an invalid read access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Overflow:**  The primary vulnerability is a heap overflow. When the size field in the "rna" packet is manipulated to be larger than expected, the `memset` function writes beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, causing corruption.
- **Invalid Read Access:**  The improper handling of the size field also results in invalid memory read access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The initial assessment indicated that the vulnerability could lead to a denial of service. The overflow can crash the affected services (`RsvcHost.exe` and `RNADiagReceiver.exe`).
- **Potential Code Execution:** A later update suggests that due to the nature of the heap overflow, code execution is not excluded. This could allow an attacker to potentially take control of the vulnerable system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. The services listen on network ports (4446 and others), allowing an attacker to send crafted "rna" packets to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable machine, to the ports where the `RsvcHost.exe` and `RNADiagReceiver.exe` are listening.
- **Crafted Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to create and send specifically crafted "rna" packets that contain a manipulated 32-bit size field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of RSLogix <= 19
- The vulnerability was identified by Luigi Auriemma
- Proof of concept exploits are available for download
- A knowledgebase article by Rockwell automation mentions the vulnerability as well.
- No fix was available at the time of the report.
