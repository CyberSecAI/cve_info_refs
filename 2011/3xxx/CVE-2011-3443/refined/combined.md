# About the security content of Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6

This document describes the security content of Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6. Safari 5.1 is included with OS X Lion.

For the protection of our customers, Apple does not disclose, discuss, or confirm security issues until a full investigation has occurred and any necessary patches or releases are available. To learn more about Apple Product Security, see the [Apple Product Security](http://www.apple.com/support/security/) website.

For information about the Apple Product Security PGP Key, see "[How to use the Apple Product Security PGP Key](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1620)."

Where possible, [CVE IDs](http://cve.mitre.org/about/) are used to reference the vulnerabilities for further information.

To learn about other Security Updates, see "[Apple Security Updates](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1222)."

#### Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: In certain situations, Safari may treat a file as HTML, even if it is served with the 'text/plain' content type. This may lead to a cross-site scripting attack on sites that allow untrusted users to post text files. This issue is addressed through improved handling of 'text/plain' content.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2010-1420 : Hidetake Jo working with Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR), Neal Poole of Matasano Security

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: The NTLM authentication protocol is susceptible to a replay attack referred to as credential reflection. Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution. To mitigate this issue, Safari has been updated to utilize protection mechanisms recently added to Windows. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2010-1383 : Takehiro Takahashi of IBM X-Force Research

* **CFNetwork**

  Impact: A root certificate that is disabled may still be trusted

  Description: CFNetwork did not properly validate that a certificate was trusted for use by a SSL server. As a result, if the user had marked a system root certificate as not trusted, Safari would still accept certificates signed by that root. This issue is addressed through improved certificate validation. This issue does not affect Mac OS X systems.

  CVE-ID

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of addresses on the heap

  Description: libxslt's implementation of the generate-id() XPath function disclosed the address of a heap buffer. Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to the disclosure of addresses on the heap. This issue is addressed by generating an ID based on the difference between the addresses of two heap buffers. For Mac OS X v10.6 systems, this issue is addressed in Mac OS X v10.6.8.
