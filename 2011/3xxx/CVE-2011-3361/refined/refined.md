Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3361:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content directly references CVE-2011-3361 and describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in BackupPC.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input when processing backup browser error messages and log file viewer error messages within BackupPC's CGI scripts. Specifically, the vulnerability resides in the `Browse.pm` and `View.pm` files. The lack of validation for the backup number allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities in the CGI scripts (`Browse.pm` and `View.pm`). The application fails to properly encode or sanitize user-provided data before displaying it within the application's web interface.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially modify the contents of a web page, redirect users to a malicious page, or steal confidential data, such as session cookies.
*   **Data Theft**: Attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information displayed within the application interface
*   **Privilege Escalation**: In some cases, an XSS vulnerability might lead to further compromise, potentially allowing an attacker to escalate privileges, depending on the application's design.
*   **Compromised Backup System:** Attackers could potentially corrupt or manipulate data within the BackupPC system by injecting malicious code into the displayed user interface.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URLs/Requests:** An attacker would exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL or HTTP request to the vulnerable CGI script which would include the injected XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering**: Attackers may trick legitimate users into clicking on crafted links that lead to exploitation.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the BackupPC server, implying network accessibility.
*   **Knowledge of BackupPC:** The attacker needs to understand the structure and parameters of the BackupPC application, particularly the CGI scripts and how they process data.
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attacker needs to craft a suitable XSS payload that will be executed by the user's browser when viewing the page generated by BackupPC.

**Summary of Technical Details**

The vulnerability stems from the BackupPC application not properly sanitizing user-supplied input used in the generation of error messages and log file viewer outputs. This lack of sanitization enables the injection of malicious scripts. Successful exploitation results in Cross-Site Scripting, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft and compromised backup system integrity. The vulnerable files are `BackupPC/lib/BackupPC/CGI/Browse.pm` and `CGI/View.pm`.
Ubuntu patches address this vulnerability by verifying that the backup number is numeric.
