Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unspecified security issues within HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM). The bulletin indicates that these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The bulletin identifies the vulnerabilities as allowing for remote execution of arbitrary code. The specific nature of the vulnerabilities isn't described, but they are exploitable through a network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Execution of Arbitrary Code:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running HP OV NNM, under the context of the user running the web server. This could allow for a wide variety of malicious activities depending on the privileges of the web server user, including system compromise, data theft, or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Exploitation:** The attack vector is described as remote, indicating that an attacker can trigger the vulnerabilities over a network without requiring local access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the target server.
- **No Authentication Required:**  The CVSS vector (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N) implies that no authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning an unauthenticated attacker can perform the exploit.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The CVSS metric indicates low attack complexity, which suggests that exploiting this vulnerability requires minimal effort from the attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The security bulletin groups CVE-2011-3166 with CVE-2011-3165 and CVE-2011-3167, all of which have similar CVSS scores and are described as leading to remote execution of arbitrary code. The three CVEs were reported to HP by the same individual(s) and through the Zero Day Initiative.
- The affected versions of HP OV NNM include v7.51 and v7.53 running on various platforms (HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, and Windows).
- HP provided patches for version 7.53 and recommends upgrading to this version from 7.51 before applying the patches.
