  "CVE-2011-3544": {
    "Description": "A type confusion flaw was found in the IIOP (Internet Inter-Orb Protocol) deserialization code. An untrusted Java applet or application could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code by deserializing a specially-crafted input. It was discovered that the Java scripting engine did not perform SecurityManager checks. This could allow a remote attacker to cause an untrusted application or applet to execute arbitrary code with the full privileges of the JVM. It was discovered that Java ScriptingEngine did not implement required SecurityManager checks. A malicious applet or application should use this flaw to bypass SecurityManager restriction and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of Java Virtual Machine.",
    "Root cause": "Type confusion in IIOP deserialization code and missing SecurityManager checks in the Java scripting engine.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion",
      "Missing SecurityManager checks",
      "Improper deserialization",
       "Insufficient access control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution, potentially with the privileges of the JVM or application. Unauthorized information disclosure, modification, denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Deserializing a specially-crafted input.",
      "Exploiting missing SecurityManager checks in the scripting engine.",
      "Malicious Java applet or application"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious input for deserialization or exploit the scripting engine without SecurityManager checks. Ability to deploy malicious applets or applications."
