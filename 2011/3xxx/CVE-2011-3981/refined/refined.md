Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `actions.php` file of the AllWebMenus WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin directly uses a user-supplied `abspath` parameter from a POST request to include a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The plugin's `actions.php` file uses `require_once(urldecode((string) $_POST["abspath"].'wp-blog-header.php'));` to include a file. The `abspath` parameter, controlled by the attacker, is prepended to `wp-blog-header.php` and passed to `require_once` without any validation, allowing an attacker to include remote files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete compromise of the WordPress site, potentially allowing the attacker to steal data, deface the website, install malware, or use the server for other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to the `actions.php` file with a crafted `abspath` parameter. The vulnerable code is located at `/wp-content/plugins/allwebmenus-wordpress-menu-plugin/actions.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the target WordPress website.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Path:** The attacker needs to know the path to the `actions.php` file and the `abspath` parameter name.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The exploit-db entry confirms the RFI vulnerability and provides a basic proof of concept (PoC).
*   It highlights the vulnerable code and indicates that version 1.1.3 of the plugin is affected.
*   The Google dork provided can be used to find vulnerable installations.

**Changeset Analysis:**

* The provided changeset from the WordPress plugin repository shows a fix was implemented which replaces the vulnerable `require_once` call using user-provided input with a hardcoded path generated by the `AWM_get_wp_header_path()` function. This function attempts to find the correct path to the `wp-blog-header.php` file relative to the plugin's directory.

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-3981 is a Remote File Inclusion vulnerability in the AllWebMenus WordPress plugin. It occurs because user-supplied input is used unsafely in a file inclusion function, enabling an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code by including a malicious remote file. The vulnerability was fixed by replacing the user-provided path with a dynamically generated path, and updating the require_once call.
