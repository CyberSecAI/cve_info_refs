{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow within the `Coreservice.exe` process of Procyon Core Server HMI. It occurs due to a lack of proper bounds checking when copying a password into a small buffer on the stack.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack-based buffer overflow",
        "Lack of input validation/bounds checking"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution with the elevated privileges of the service (SYSTEM). A failed attempt may lead to a denial of service.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted request (long password) to TCP port 23 of the vulnerable server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Remote attacker. No authentication required.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to overwrite a Structured Exception Handling (SEH) record on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution. The application is designed to automatically recover after a crash, which can be a consideration for persistence."
