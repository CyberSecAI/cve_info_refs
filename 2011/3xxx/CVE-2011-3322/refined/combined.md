					This module exploits a vulnerability in the coreservice.exe component of Proycon
				Core Server <= v1.13. While processing a password, the application
				fails to do proper bounds checking before copying data into a small buffer on the stack.
				This causes a buffer overflow and allows to overwrite a structured exception handling
				record on the stack, allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution.  Also, after the
				payload exits, Coreservice.exe should automatically recover.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Summary
stratsec has identified a remote stack overflow vulnerability within the Procyon Core Server HMI service. The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted request to port 23. This vulnerability can lead directly to remote code execution running with the elevated privileges of the service. Failed attempts will likely lead to a denial of service condition.
Description
Procyon Core HMI Server is a low cost but flexible software package suitable for simple HMI through to SCADA and large scale DCS systems that is compatible with all Data Track Process Instrument products. During installation, the server installs itself as a Windows service and automatically recovers if the service crashes. Due to the fact that it is running as a Windows service, code executed by the service executes with SYSTEM privileges.
Impact
A remote attacker could perform remote code execution with elevated privileges against an exposed vulnerable version of Procyon Core server. The impact is likely to depend on the vulnerable environment and its use of the software.
Technical Details
The memory corruption vulnerability is within the &#8216;Coreservice.exe&#8217; process that allows an attacker to perform an arbitrary read and write operation. This vulnerability can be leveraged to trigger a stack based buffer overflow. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long password request to TCP port 23 of the affected server.
00475DD7 mov eax, [eax+edx\*4-4] ; initially, the attacker has control over EAX and EDX
00475DDB lea edx, [ebp+var\_4D]
00475DDE call sub\_40A288
An arithmetic calculation is completed on EAX and EDX to determine the destination address for the following copy operation.
sub\_40A288:
0040A288 push edi
0040A289 push esi
0040A28A mov esi, eax
0040A28C mov edi, edx
0040A28E mov ecx, 0FFFFFFFFh
0040A293 xor al, al
0040A295 repne scasb ; a fixed sized buffer of 52 bytes
0040A297 not ecx
0040A299 mov edi, esi
0040A29B mov esi, edx
0040A29D mov edx, ecx
0040A29F mov eax, edi
0040A2A1 sh ecx, 2
0040A2A4 rep movsd ; stack overflow is here
0040A2A6 mov ecx, edx
0040A2A8 and ecx, 3
0040A2AB rep movsb
Affected products
Procyon Core Server v1.06 has been confirmed vulnerable. Other versions before 1.14 are also likely to be affected.
Proof of concept
