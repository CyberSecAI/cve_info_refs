# USN-1257-1: radvd vulnerabilities

10 November 2011

radvd could be made to crash or overwrite certain files if it received
specially crafted network traffic.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [radvd](/security/cves?package=radvd) - Router Advertisement Daemon

## Details

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly parsed the

ND\_OPT\_DNSSL\_INFORMATION option. A remote attacker could exploit this with

a specially-crafted request and cause the radvd daemon to crash, or

possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected

releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. This issue

only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2011-3601](/security/CVE-2011-3601))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly filtered interface names

when creating certain files. A local attacker could exploit this to

overwrite certain files on the system, bypassing intended permissions.

([CVE-2011-3602](/security/CVE-2011-3602))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly handled certain lengths.

A remote attacker could exploit this to cause the radvd daemon to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3604](/security/CVE-2011-3604))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly handled delays when used

in unicast mode, which is not the default in Ubuntu. If used in unicast

mode, a remote attacker could cause radvd outages, resulting in a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-3605](/security/CVE-2011-3605))

Subject: radvd 1.8.2 released with security fixes

Hi,

I was hoping that Vasiliy would post this, but he appears to be
unavailable at the moment.  Since the release is already out (and
postponing it seemed inappropriate), I decided to announce this on
oss-security sooner rather than later.

<http://www.litech.org/radvd/>
<http://lists.litech.org/pipermail/radvd-announce-l/2011-October/000022.html>

radvd-1.8.2/INTRO.html describes radvd as follows:

---
IPv6 has a lot more support for autoconfiguration than IPv4.  But for
this autoconfiguration to work on the hosts of a network, the routers of
the local network have to run a program which answers the
autoconfiguration requests of the hosts.

On Linux this program is called radvd, which stands for Router
ADVertisement Daemon.  This daemon listens to Router Solicitations (RS)
and answers with Router Advertisement (RA). [...]
---

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered a number of security vulnerabilities and some
other issues in radvd 1.8.1, and provided patches for some of them.

Reuben Hawkins, the current upstream maintainer for radvd, promptly
merged the patches, made additional fixes, and made the 1.8.2 release.

radvd-1.8.2/CHANGES describes 5 fixes that were determined to be of
security relevance:

---
1) A privilege escalation flaw was found in radvd, due to a buffer overflow
in the process_ra() function.  ND_OPT_DNSSL_INFORMATION option parsing
"label_len" was not checked for negative values, leading to a "suffix"
buffer overflow which can lead to privilege escalation, at least if
radvd is compiled without GCC's stack protection. If radvd is invoked
without privilege separation (the -u option), this can lead to an
escalation to root privileges.  Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux starts
radvd by default with the unprivileged user. (CVE-2011-3601)

2) An arbitrary file overwrite flaw was found in radvd's
set_interface_var() function, where it did not check the interface name
(generated by the unprivileged user) and blindly overwrites a filename
with a decimal value by the root process.  If a local attacker could
create symlinks pointing to arbitrary files on the system, they could
overwrite the target file contents.  If only radvd is compromised (e.g.
no local access), the attacker may only overwrite files with specific
names only (PROC_SYS_IP6_* from radvd's pathnames.h). (CVE-2011-3602)

3) The radvd daemon would not fail on privsep_init() errors, which could
cause it to run with full root privileges when it should be running as
an unprivileged user. (CVE-2011-3603)

4) A number of buffer overread flaws were found in radvd's process_ra()
function due to numerous missed len() checks. This can lead to memory
reads outside of the stack, resulting in a crash of radvd.
(CVE-2011-3604)

5) A temporary denial of service flaw was found in radvd's process_rs()
function, where it would call mdelay() on the same thread in which it
handled all input.  If ->UnicastOnly were set, an attacker could cause a
flood with ND_ROUTER_SOLICIT and fill the input queue of the daemon.
This would cause a brief outage of approximately MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME / 2 *
sizeof_input_queue when handling new clients, where MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME is
500ms, leading to delays of more than a minute.  Note: this is only the
case in unicast-only mode; there is no denial of service in the (normal,
default) anycast mode. (CVE-2011-3605)
---

Some additional issues fixed in radvd 1.8.2 were determined to have no
obvious security relevance.

For those wanting a patch for review or backports, it is sufficient to
diff 1.8.2 against 1.8.1 - there are no unrelated changes.  SHA-1:

c7e8ac6222099c62519b9893f833440037352971  radvd-1.8.1.tar.gz
9a396ab58216c87308bc86a18864f84aeeba38a9  radvd-1.8.2.tar.gz

We'd like to thank Reuben Hawkins for prompt handling of these issues.
We're also grateful to linux-distros list members who have contributed
to the brief pre-disclosure discussion (5 days).

The linux-distros list is meant for medium severity issues.  Although
some of the radvd issues were high impact, Vasiliy and I felt that risk
probability during the embargo period was low enough that the overall
severity was medium.  Besides Linux distros, FreeBSD and NetBSD were
notified.

Alexander

2011/10/08 More careful checking of iface name
2011/10/06 Updating buffer usage tracking in send\_ra to track buffer usage BEFORE
the buffer is used rather than after in order to prevent buffer overflow
2011/10/06 1.8.2 release
2011/10/04 1) A privilege escalation flaw was found in radvd, due to a buffer overflow
in the process\_ra() function. ND\_OPT\_DNSSL\_INFORMATION option parsing
"label\_len" was not checked for negative values, leading to a "suffix"
buffer overflow which can lead to privilege escalation, at least if
radvd is compiled without GCC's stack protection. If radvd is invoked
without privilege separation (the -u option), this can lead to an
escalation to root privileges. Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux starts
radvd by default with the unprivileged user. (CVE-2011-3601)
2) An arbitrary file overwrite flaw was found in radvd's
set\_interface\_var() function, where it did not check the interface name
(generated by the unprivileged user) and blindly overwrites a filename
with a decimal value by the root process. If a local attacker could
create symlinks pointing to arbitrary files on the system, they could
overwrite the target file contents. If only radvd is compromised (e.g.
no local access), the attacker may only overwrite files with specific
names only (PROC\_SYS\_IP6\_\* from radvd's pathnames.h). (CVE-2011-3602)
3) The radvd daemon would not fail on privsep\_init() errors, which could
cause it to run with full root privileges when it should be running as
an unprivileged user. (CVE-2011-3603)
4) A number of buffer overread flaws were found in radvd's process\_ra()
function due to numerous missed len() checks. This can lead to memory
reads outside of the stack, resulting in a crash of radvd.
(CVE-2011-3604)
5) A temporary denial of service flaw was found in radvd's process\_rs()
function, where it would call mdelay() on the same thread in which it
handled all input. If ->UnicastOnly were set, an attacker could cause a
flood with ND\_ROUTER\_SOLICIT and fill the input queue of the daemon.
This would cause a brief outage of approximately MAX\_RA\_DELAY\_TIME / 2 \*
sizeof\_input\_queue when handling new clients, where MAX\_RA\_DELAY\_TIME is
500ms, leading to delays of more than a minute. Note: this is only the
case in unicast-only mode; there is no denial of service in the (normal,
default) anycast mode. (CVE-2011-3605)
2011/08/19 uClibc has no ifaddrs.h patch by Lonnie

UnicastOnly is on or AdvSendAdvert is off.
This got broken in radvd 1.3. Patch from Cedric BAIL.
2010/03/05 Release 1.6.
2010/03/05 Update Redhat spec and init files from Fedora.
2010/01/28 Decrease MSG\_SIZE from 4096 to about 1500B. Send buffer
uses a smaller size in order to avoid sending out
fragmented packets, yet being able to receive full-size
frames.
2010/01/28 Keep track of buffer size and exit if the number of
prefixes/routes/etc. would grow too much. Prevent a memory
corruption due to wrong memset. Patches from Jan
Gé¡¤ig, Red Hat bug #554125.
2010/01/22 On BSD use getifaddrs() also in setup\_deviceinfo(),
fixes a multiple interfaces problem on NetBSD 5 due to
change in data structures. Patch from Michael Stapelberg.
2009/11/07 Allow radvd.conf prefix, clients, route, and RDNSS options
to be in any order. Patch from Michael Stapelberg.
2009/09/10 Release 1.5.
2009/09/07 Fix infinite loop/segmentation fault problems when cable
plugged out/plugged back in, caused by reload\_config()
and subsequent timer list corruption. Slightly modified
patch from Teemu Torma. For more information, see
http://lists.litech.org/pipermail/radvd-devel-l/2009-August/000416.html
2009/09/07 Fix IgnoreIfMissing when cable is unplugged at startup.
Radvd would keep skipping the interface. Patch from
Reuben Hawkins.
2009/08/25 Fix parallel make, from Robert Buchholz / Gentoo.
2009/08/03 Release 1.4. Only restores original behaviour changed in
1.3: RAs were accidentally often unicast to solicitors
instead of being multicast.
2009/07/07 Release 1.3.
2009/06/24 Work around unaligned traps on Alpha, patch from:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=456205
2009/06/19 Fixes and enhancements from Michael Stapelberg. Add a new
'clients' interface definition to allow configuring which
address to send advertisements and accept from. Use
getifaddrs() on BSD because ioctl didn't work on NetBSD 5.
Use int instead of bool to make NetBSD 5 happy.
2009/01/21 Add a workaround for Linux in scenarios where libc is
providing IPV6\_RECV(PKTINFO|HOPLIMIT) has renumbered IPV6\_PKTINFO,
but kernel doesn't support it yet (<2.6.14). Found out by
Freetz (special thanks to Paul Oranje) and OpenWrt projects.
See the source code and CVS changelog for more.
2008/10/28 Release 1.2.
2008/10/14 Accept virtually any interface name (up to 15 chars) instead of
forcing a specific naming convention. Patch from
Michiel Brandenburg.
If stale radvd.pid file exists, try to overwrite it unless
the specified PID exists, from Fedora (Martin Nagy).
Define \_GNU\_SOURCE on Linux, otherwise glibc >= 2.8
compilation fails.
Remove -Wconversion from default CFLAGS as it is very noisy.
Fix some warnings, from Jim Paris.
2008/03/31 Update references to RFCs. Give pointer to the "two hour rule".
Decrease the default valid and preferred lifetimes from 30/1
days to 1day/4hours, respectively. See more info at:
http://lists.litech.org/pipermail/radvd-devel-l/2007-October/000282.html
2008/02/04 Release 1.1.
2008/01/24 Implement privilege separation (Linux only) so that
config\_interface() works both with a user and root,
even after HUP signal. Work by Jim Paris.
2008/01/24 The old Linux retrans\_timer proc value is given in
USER\_HZ, not in seconds. Fix that, by Jim Paris.
2008/01/21 Fix stderr+syslog logging crash (on non-i386). Analysis and
patch by Jim Paris (Debian bug #409600).
2007/12/01 Require that interface is also 'RUNNING' instead of just
'UP', except if IgnoreIfMissing is enabled. The reason is
that at least some recent Linux kernels do not generate
link-local addresses before interface is running and as
a result, the startup may fail if network cable is unplugged
in any case.
Note: this could break deployments with some very old
kernels, see more info at:
http://lists.litech.org/pipermail/radvd-devel-l/2007-October/000280.html
2007/10/25 Implement automatically selecting and advertising an
interface address, see radvd.conf(5) for more. Add
a warning about not being able to set interface
variables with non-root user. Relax interface naming
a bit.
2007/06/25 Send prefix, route and RDNSS options (matters if there
are many RDNSS options) in the same order they appear
in the configuration; add support for AdvDefaultLifetime
in radvdump (patches from C. Scott Ananian)
2006/01/11 Release 1.0.
2006/09/10 Perform a static/dynamic code audit; plug some minor
bugs (see CVS changelogs for more information) and
perform minor clean-up.
2006/07/08 Implement MAX\_INITIAL\_RTR\_ADVERT\_INTERVAL handling,
patch from Yoshifuji Hideaki / USAGI.
2006/05/23 Unblock SIGALRM signals at startup. Some scripts/programs
seem to run radvd from ALRM-blocked context which breaks
the timers.
2006/05/23 Redefined IgnoreIfMissing: by default, radvd will now
try to reinitialize failed interfaces automatically.
IgnoreIfMissing is still needed if radvd is started when the
interface isn't up, and it also quenches some messages
relating to missing interfaces.
2006/03/29 Implement RDNSS draft, using non-allocated
IANA ND type value 25, by Laurå¹¨ine Provost,
Mickaè Guå»¨in, Adrien Clerc, Gaetan Eleouet,
Bahattin Demirplak, Lionel Guilmin (at the
ENSEEIHT, Toulouse)
2006/03/06 Fix the default STDERR+syslog logging methods, so
we don't try to unnecessarily log to STDERR after
forking.
2006/01/18 radvd-0.9.1 did not initialize AdvDefaultLifetime (etc.)
appropriately, unbreak the "clean-up".
2006/01/13 Release 0.9.1.
2005/12/30 Great cleanup of signed/unsigned values, add
-Wall and a number of other warnings to CFLAGS
by default. Do not allow signed values for
HomeAgentPreference anymore.
2005/12/30 Fix a couple of IPv6 Ready Logo Phase-2 IPv6 Core
Protocols Self Test issues, patches from Yoshifuji
Hideaki / USAGI.
2005/11/13 Create a short FAQ in README file.
2005/10/28 Get interface MTU automatically, so that you can
use jumboframes and advertise MTU >1500.
2005/10/19 Release 0.9.
2005/10/18 Transfer sole maintainership of radvd to Pekka Savola.
2005/10/18 Make the radvd.conf syntax dump default
in radvdump and remove the previous default to
reduce code duplication.
2005/09/28 Add NEMO Basic support (RFC3961) and fix default
HomeAgentLifetime, from Ville Nuorvala.
2005/08/18 Implement more robust timer handler, especially
because some Linux kernels don't seem to behave
all that well; see http://lkml.org/lkml/2005/4/29/163.
Based on extensive testing & reports by
Tomasz Grobelny. NB: the bug report was caused by
a bad timer patch in PLD's kernel package, and this
should not occur often with standard kernels.
2005/07/24 Implement a new logging method "stderr\_syslog" which is
now also the default. Everything is logged on syslog,
while the most important messages (i.e., start-up failures)
are also logged on stderr.
2005/07/08 Release 0.8.
2005/07/05 Change the more-specific route ND option code
from de-facto '9' to the official '24'. Change
back in defaults.h if you need old behaviour.
2005/07/05 Fix wrongly calculated prefix with Base6to4Interface
on ppc and maybe other big endian arches, from
Debian #301543 by Sam Hathaway.
2005/07/05 Fix Linux-2.6.12-bk4+ error with HUP signal,
from YOSHIFUJI Hideaki / USAGI.
2005/03/29 Merge a part of MIPv6/non-MIPv6 code, make printing
error messages nicer.
2005/03/22 Be a bit more informative about config file parsing
errors.
2005/02/21 Release 0.7.3.
2005/02/19 Fix crash when reloading config with AdvSendAdvert off.
2005/02/15 Merge a few fixes and improvements from USAGI:
- support microsecond scheduling and fix RA intervals
- send zero router lifetime when forwarding is disabled
- use a more flexible inter-RA delay
2005/01/07 Accomodate interface indexes > 9999, from Hagen Fritsch.
2004/12/15 Advertise zero Router Lifetime when shutting down;
implements a SHOULD in RFC2461 section 6.2.5.
2004/10/16 Update Mobile IPv6 to match RFC 3775, from Greg Daley.
2004/08/20 Minor documentation cleanups.
2004/03/09 Implement "IgnoreIfMissing" interface flag, which can be
used on interfaces which aren't enabled when radvd starts
but will later become available (e.g., Bluetooth) --
and then you wish to send HUP to radvd to activate the
configs.
2004/02/21 Further cleanups, to fix autoconf/autoheader problems
with newer toolchain; mostly by Marko Myllynen.
2004/02/20 Clean up a bit: remove old junk from configure.in,
rename "log()" to "flog()" to satisfy newer GCCs,
allow underscores in the interface names (the last two
fixes already committed earlier).
2004/01/19 Make radvd check for forwarding status using procfs on
Linux; needed with 2.6 kernels. Loosely based on
a patch by USAGI.
2003/11/21 Add support for Router Preferences and More Specific
Routes from Markku Savela .
NOTE! The specification is not final yet, there will be
changes! (Man page, documentation and radvdump support
by Pekka Savola.)
2003/09/11 When starting up, check if the MAC address is all zero
(could happen e.g. with bridge interfaces with no attached
physical interfaces), and warn if so. For more information,
http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show\_bug.cgi?id=103469
2003/06/10 When chrooting, check the possible return code
from chdir("/").
2003/03/08 Add patch from MAEDA Naoaki
to discard RS's from the unspecied source address with
link-layer address option, as required by RFC2461.
2002/10/28 Release 0.7.2:
- add support for VLANs (from USAGI)
- make it compile better on newer NetBSD's (NetBSD)
- fix a syntax error in radvd.conf(5) sample documentation
- use IPV6\_RECV{HOPLIMIT,PKTINFO} not
IPV6\_{HOPLIMIT,PKTINFO} if supported
- (in Red Hat spec file) don't create radvd gid explicitly
- a lot of coding style cleanups
2002/01/16 Release 0.7.1.
2002/01/12 Update config.{guess,sub} from ftp.gnu.org; update INTRO.
Marko Myllynen and Debian bug #115992.
2002/01/02 Ensure NULL-termination with strncpy.
2001/12/31 Radvdump fixes: eliminate a warning of Prefix Information
sections with '-d -f'; add a note that
{Min,Max}RtrAdvInterval cannot be obtained with '-f';
implement '-e' to be used with '-f' which omits all
advertised default settings. Mostly by Marko Myllynen.
2001/12/28 Small cleanups. AdvSendAdvert is implicitly off by
default. Check configuration file permissions; must
not be writable by others, and if non-root,
not by self/own group. By Marko Myllynen.
2001/12/21 Check via sysctl that IPv6 forwarding is enabled;
exit unless debugging is enabled. Triggered by
Marko Myllynen.
2001/11/22 MinRtrAdvInterval for MIPv6 is 0.05 seconds, not 0.5.
(Note: untested).
2001/11/20 Rework BSD device memory management a bit, minor cleanups.
Version bumped to 0.7.0.
2001/11/14 Maintainership of radvd transferred from Lars Fenneberg
to Pekka Savola and Nathan Lutchansky. Lars' CVS
repository adopted, and changes merged from the -pX
branch.
2001/08/29 Minor change for NetBSD 1.5.1 compatibility.
(Nathan Lutchansky)
2001/07/20 Support for non-multicast links, like ISATAP.
(Nathan Lutchansky)
2001/07/03 Minimum MTU has been changed to 1280 in the latest RFC's.
(Pekka Savola)
2001/06/30 Check for possible buffer overflows; replace strcpy with
strncpy. No fatals found. Remove redunant radvd -t check.
(Pekka Savola)
2001/06/24 Fix 1-byte overflow in /proc/net/igmp6 handling,
clean out possible memory garbage when sending RA's
(patch from ).
2001/06/19 When dropping root, also set up supplementary groups
properly. On Linux, when sending RA's, check that the
interface has joined all-routers multicast group. Add a few
RFC2461 MUST sanity checks when receiving datagrams. Clean
out non-EUI64 addressing scheme and other minor bits.
(Pekka Savola)
2001/04/28 Misc cleanup and bugfixes, automake support.
2001/03/28 Grammar cleanup. Integrated 6to4 support through
"Base6to4Interface" option in prefix configuration. Signal
handling fixed by blocking on select() rather than recvmsg()
so SIGTERM/HUP take effect immediately now. (Nathan Lutchansky)
2001/03/27 Security fixes: close stdin/out and chdir("/") via
daemon() to prevent possible exploits, and a flag to allow
radvd to set[ug]id to an unprivileged user (from Pekka Savola).
2001/02/01 scope\_id is not supported in glibc2.1. So it is now
compiled conditionally.
2001/01/31 Add CC variable to Makefile. Fix bug with IPV6\_ADD\_MEMBERSHIP
handling. Set scope\_id when sending packets.
2000/12/02 man pages update, rewritten pid file handling, rewritten
signal handling (SIGHUP and SIGTERM), gcc warnings cleanup,
new radvdump option -f: print received RAs in config file
format (by Marko)
2000/11/19 integrated the last two change entries into the main source
(patches by Marko Myllynen), fixed bug in log.c, fixed file
description leak in readin\_config, rewrote code in timer.c,
updated man pages again (from Marko Myllynen, too), PID
file support (patch from Marko Myllynen, based on a patch
from Tommi.Komulainen@iki.fi)
2000/08/15 RFC 2461 updates, Mobile IPv6 extensions added
2000/07/14 added RA interval option and modified some default values
for timers
1999/06/15 changed to run with glibc 2.1 on RedHat 6.0.
1998/03/03 radvd now joins ipv6-allrouters on Linux. Fix contributed
by A.N.Kuznetsov .
1997/10/23 radvd will now accept any prefix length in its config
file but will warn about unusual ones
1997/10/19 removed backwards compatibility code in recv.c.
IPV6\_HOPLIMIT support is now assumed to exist.
1997/10/19 fixed alignment problems in recv.c and send.c.
1997/10/16 the Makefile install target now uses mkinstalldirs.
1997/10/16 changed all u\_int\*\_t to uint\*\_t for better POSIX
compliance and portability. Needs 2.1.57-CVS or glibc.
BSD seems to need patches.
1997/10/16 more intelligent configure; tries to figure out
where the IPv6 libraries and inclues are (if not in
the standard places). Searches in /usr/inet6 and /usr/ipv6.
1997/10/15 integrated small patches for glibc and BSD from Craig and
Philip
1997/09/14 EUI-64 "support"
1997/09/01 centralized all includes into includes.h for easier
maintainance
1997/08/25 changed all occurences of IPV6\_TXINFO/IPV6\_RXINFO
to IPV6\_PKTINFO
1997/08/25 removed some compatibility stuff for older Linux kernels
