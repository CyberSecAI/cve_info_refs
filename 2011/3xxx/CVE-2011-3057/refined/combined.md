How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Chrome Stable Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2012/03/chrome-stable-update.html "Chrome Stable Update")

Sunday, March 4, 2012

**UPDATE: We detected a [minor issue](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=116789) and have temporarily suspended pushing this release. A new release of Chrome stable will be available shortly.**

**The Chrome Stable channel has been updated to 17.0.963.65 on Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame.  This release fixes a number of issues including:**

* **Cursors and backgrounds sometimes do not load ([bug 111218](http://crbug.com/111218))**
* **Plugins not loading on some pages ([bug 108228](http://crbug.com/108228))**
* **Text paste includes trailing spaces ([bug 106551](http://crbug.com/106551))**
* **Websites using touch controls break ([bug 110332](http://crbug.com/110332))**

**Along with these fixes, the release contains an updated version of the Adobe Flash player.  More information on Flash updates is [available from Adobe](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/923/cpsid_92359.html).

Security fixes and rewards:

Firstly, we have some special rewards for some special bugs!**

*** [$10,000] [[116661](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=116661)] Rockstar CVE-1337-d00d1: Excessive WebKit fuzzing. Credit to miaubiz.

**To determine the above rewards, we looked at bug finding performance over the past few months. The three named individuals stood out significantly. It also shouldn’t come as a surprise that they all feature (and earn more!) in the release notes below.

We have always reserved the right to arbitrarily reward sustained, extraordinary contributions. In this instance, we’re dropping a surprise bonus. We reserve the right to do so again and reserve the right to do so on a more regular basis! Chrome has a leading reputation for security and it wouldn’t be possible without the aggressive bug hunting of the wider community.

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.**

# Chromium: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium, some of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **17.0.963.83** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **17.0.963.83** |

### Background

Chromium is an open source web browser project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium. Please review
the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted web
site using Chromium, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition,
Universal Cross-Site Scripting, or installation of an extension without
user interaction.

A remote attacker could also entice a user to install a specially
crafted extension that would interfere with browser-issued web requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/chromium-17.0.963.83"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
