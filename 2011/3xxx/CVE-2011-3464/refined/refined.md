Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error in the `png_formatted_warning()` function within the `pngerror.c` file of the libpng library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A one-byte stack buffer overflow exists due to the off-by-one error.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation could potentially lead to crashes (denial of service) or, in some cases, the execution of arbitrary code. This is a stack based buffer overflow and may allow for RCE.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `png_formatted_warning()` function is called. This function is used for displaying warning messages within the library.
- The vulnerability would be triggered by an application utilizing a vulnerable version of libpng when a specific condition triggering the warning is met

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide input that triggers the execution of `png_formatted_warning()` with specific parameters leading to a buffer overflow. This may be done by providing malformed PNG images or other input that triggers libpng warnings.

**Additional notes:**

- The provided text indicates this issue was fixed in libpng version 1.5.8.
- This vulnerability is also part of the Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 201206-15, which details multiple vulnerabilities affecting libpng.
- The vulnerability is considered exploitable remotely according to the Gentoo advisory.
