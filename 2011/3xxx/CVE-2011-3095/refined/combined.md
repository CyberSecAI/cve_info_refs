# Chromium, V8: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201205-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium and V8,
some of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **19.0.1084.46** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **19.0.1084.46** |

| Package | **dev-lang/v8** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.9.24.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.9.24.21** |

### Background

Chromium is an open source web browser project. V8 is Google’s open
source JavaScript engine.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium and V8. Please
review the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted web site or JavaScript program using Chromium or V8, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process, or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-client/chromium-19.0.1084.46"

```

All V8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/v8-3.9.24.21"

```
