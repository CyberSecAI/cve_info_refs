Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2011-3095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write within the OGG container handling code in Chromium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-bounds write:**  The software writes data beyond the allocated buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The out-of-bounds write can be leveraged by an attacker to overwrite critical data structures, potentially allowing them to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Chromium process.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crash or abnormal termination of the process is another possible impact of the vulnerability if the overwritten memory leads to instability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially Crafted Web Site/JavaScript Program:** An attacker can create a malicious website or JavaScript that includes a specially crafted OGG container. When a user opens this website or executes the JavaScript using a vulnerable version of Chromium, the vulnerability will be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Context-Dependent Attacker:** The attacker needs to entice the user to open a web page or execute JavaScript under their control using a vulnerable browser.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, without needing physical access to the targeted machine.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is specifically within the OGG container handling, indicating a problem in how Chromium processes OGG files/streams.
* The severity is rated as "High" and a reward of $1000 was given to the reporter, implying its significant impact.

In summary, CVE-2011-3095 describes a high-severity, remotely exploitable vulnerability in Chromium involving an out-of-bounds write when handling OGG container formats. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
