Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `process_ra()` function in radvd lacks multiple buffer length checks. This function is responsible for processing Router Advertisement (RA) messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Over-read:** The missing length checks allow the function to read beyond the boundaries of allocated memory on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Reading outside of the allocated stack memory can cause the `radvd` daemon to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote:** An attacker can send specially crafted IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages to a vulnerable `radvd` instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the machine running the vulnerable `radvd` daemon. No specific authentication or local access is mentioned.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious RA packet that exploits the missing length checks in the `process_ra()` function.
