Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-3412:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists because Microsoft Publisher does not properly handle memory while parsing specially crafted Publisher files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to improper handling of memory during parsing of a specially crafted .pub file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Publisher.
- Complete control of the affected system: If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Email: An attacker could send a specially crafted Publisher file to a user and convince them to open it.
- Web-based attack: An attacker could host the malicious file on a website and convince a user to visit the site and open the file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a specially crafted Publisher file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the crafted Publisher file. This can be achieved via social engineering via email or by hosting the malicious file on a website that the user will visit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability can not be automatically exploited through email. User interaction is required to open the specially crafted file.
- This vulnerability is one of four addressed by the MS11-091 security bulletin. The other three are CVE-2011-1508, CVE-2011-3410, and CVE-2011-3411.
- The severity is rated as "Important" by Microsoft, with a CVSS base score of 9.
- Mitigating factors include the fact that users with lower rights are less affected than administrative users.
- A workaround is to avoid opening .pub files from untrusted sources.
- This vulnerability was reported by Will Dormann of the CERT/CC.
