# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

[This is from the MB-Secissues mailing list.]
Hi
We just fixed an issue in Opera 11.50, but as we noticed a few other browsers are vulnerable, we did not post any details.
<http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs/windows/1150/>: "Fixed a moderately severe issue. Details will be disclosed at a later date."
The issue is an old one. Some non-HTTP protocols running on a server might respond to HTTP requests with an error message, and return (parts of) the incoming request. If web browsers content-sniff data returned withouth HTTP headers, an attacker might be able to send data to such a service, and have the server return an error which the browser interprets as HTML/JS. This opens up for XSS.
HTTP version 0.9 (which is still in use in some rare cases) does not send HTTP headers, so we still content sniff on ports 80 and 443. Our fix is to stop content sniffing on non-standard ports. We require either an explicit HTTP/1.\* header (then we will content sniff), or a Content-type. There are of course other fixes too, like not running scripting, even if one does content sniff. Our test case tests our implementation, so it might be some other browsers are not vulnerable, even though I have listed them as failing on our TC.
We will withhold information for now, if nobody tells us otherwise, we will publish full details next time we clean up in our unpublished advisories, at least half a year from now. If anyone wants us to hold off longer, or would like more info, please let us know.
Failing on our test case:
Opera 11.11
Chrome 12.0
Safari 5.0.4
Firefox 4.0.1
Internet Explorer 8.0
Passing on our test case:
Opera 11.50
This has been tested well, and we have found no compatibility issues with this.

When they say they don't content sniff, what behavior did they implement, exactly?
I would have no problem with not sniffing HTTP 0.9 document types on non-default ports, I think; the obvious option is to treat them as application/octet-stream.
But note that this does NOT help with <script>s, because those ignore the content-type anyway. So are they only protecting against sniffing as HTML and not worrying about <script>s embedding such content? Or something else?
It's hard to evaluate what needs doing here about a better idea of what their attack scenario is and what their proposed change is.

Specifically what I sent:
Sigbjørn,
This mail is about your post to MB-Secissues about HTTP 0.9 and sniffing. There's a Gecko bug tracking this at [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=667907](/show_bug.cgi?id=667907 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible XSS via HTTP 0.9 errors and content-sniffing") (security-sensitive, of course; I can add you to the bug if you have a bugzilla account).
I'm trying to understand the extent of the problem here. Your description of Opera's mitigation is that you simply don't perform type sniffing on such responses, but <script> tags ignore the type anyway. So are you just protecting against using an HTTP 0.9 response as HTML in this situation but not against using it as a script?
What XSS vectors are you concerned with, exactly? For a non-default port, a page would not typically run with the origin of regular (port 80/443) pages on the same hostname, right? So while you can inject script into the page and run it with the origin "<http://targetsite:weirdport>", what issues does that cause? I suppose it can circumvent XHR same-origin restrictions?
The other question I had is what your mitigation actually does. You don't sniff the type. Does that mean you treat it as application/octet-stream? Or something else?

|  | |

On MB-SecIssues, Adam Langley of Google asked:
> Is there a new, specific, cross-protocol attack here or is this a
> general mitigation?
and Sigbjørn replied:
This is a general mitigation, we have not done any research into which protocols/applications might be abused this way.

Reply to my mail too:
1) "Correct. Scripts in an HTML file will be executed in the domain of the HTML
file. Plain scripts execute in the domain of the HTML file which includes
them."
2) "You are right that the same origin policy typically protects against cross
port vectors, though the web is not used to relying on this. For instance
cookies do not abide by ports, and you mention XHR. I don't think the
origin header takes this into consideration either. If you start looking
into other technologies (e.g. plugins, SVG, Xpath, cached site policy
files, application cache ...), I am sure you will find other examples. For
practical purposes, getting cookie access is mostly equivalent to XSS.
Apologies if my original mail was unclear."
3) "text/plain"
Doing what Opera did should not be difficult if that's the way we want to go. Thoughts?

It's probably not a common scenario, but large/popular domains with cookies worth stealing are precisely the ones who might have a non-web server running on one of their public machines somewhere. Maybe on a non-banned port.Whiteboard: [sg:high]

the content type of a http/0.9 is supposed to be html, not plain.
<http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/AsImplemented.html>
I don't know that it matters, without content-sniffing its pretty much just not going to work no matter what for somebody.

Right, but that gives the XSS issue.
> without content-sniffing its pretty much just not going to work
Indeed. That's the effect of this patch. HTTP/0.9 on non-default ports (80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS) will just show the text and that's it.

The only obvious one is compat risk, but we haven't run into issues with it, and I would judge it to be pretty low.

What is the manual STR for this or is the new 1.9.2 unit test sufficient to test this for 1.9.2 verification?

The other option is to set up a web server that serves something that looks like HTML on a non-standard port using HTTP 0.9 and see whether a script in that HTML runs...

Thanks, Boris! ;-)

This was rated "sg:high" based on the "XSS" claim, but a server running something that we think is maybe HTTP 0.9 is on a different origin (scheme-host-port) than the site's actual website by definition. There are risks here (spoofing, grabbing non-httponly domain cookies) but it's not universal XSS and doesn't meet the "high" bar for me.
Please correct if I'm missing a potential attack that's more severe.Whiteboard: [sg:high] → [sg:moderate]

Trusting this is fixed for other versions of Firefox just as Al did for 1.9.2. If someone is already set up to verify this fix re: [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=667907#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible XSS via HTTP 0.9 errors and content-sniffing"), please do so.
