Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way web browsers handle HTTP 0.9 responses, particularly when served on non-standard ports. HTTP 0.9 lacks headers, and browsers were relying on content sniffing to determine the type of content received. This behavior allowed an attacker to potentially inject malicious code by sending a specially crafted HTTP 0.9 response, which would then be interpreted as HTML/JavaScript by the browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Content Sniffing on non-standard ports:** Browsers were performing content sniffing on HTTP 0.9 responses even when served from non-standard ports.
*   **Lack of Content-Type Validation:** The absence of a Content-Type header in HTTP 0.9 responses led to the browser relying solely on content sniffing, which could be manipulated.
*   **XSS via content sniffing:**  The browsers could be tricked into interpreting a crafted HTTP 0.9 response as HTML/JS, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **HTTP 0.9 support:** While not widely used, the support for HTTP 0.9 protocol in browsers provided an attack vector

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into a page, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing cookies or performing other unauthorized actions on the target site.
*   **Cookie Theft:**  Exploitation could potentially lead to the theft of cookies, which could compromise a user's session or account.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious HTTP 0.9 Responses:** An attacker could set up a server on a non-standard port that responds to HTTP requests with an HTTP 0.9 error containing malicious code.
*   **Content Sniffing Manipulation:** The attacker would exploit the browser's content sniffing behavior, causing it to interpret the malicious response as HTML or Javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to control a server on non-standard ports:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a server on a port other than 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS) and serve the malicious content via HTTP 0.9.
*   **Knowledge of content sniffing mechanisms:** The attacker needs to be aware of how the browser performs content sniffing in order to craft a response that will be misinterpreted by the browser.

**Additional Notes**
*   The provided bug report mentions that while this is an XSS vulnerability, the server would be running on a different origin, however, there are risks associated with cookies not abiding by port numbers.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by disabling content sniffing for HTTP 0.9 responses on non-standard ports and treating those responses as `text/plain`.
*   The fix was backported to older versions of Firefox.
*   The security severity was initially rated high ("sg:high"), then changed to moderate ("sg:moderate") because the issue requires a server to be running on a non-standard port.
