**Impact of exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a potential for an unexpected application termination (crash) or arbitrary code execution. 
- In some cases, this can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- Additionally, the issue is described as a "memory corruption" issue in multiple sources, implying the potential to overwrite memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted website.
- An attacker would need to entice a user to visit this specially crafted website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject a malicious code into a legitimate website.
- The attacker does not require prior access to the user's system.
- The attacker needs to have the victim user browse to the malicious webpage using a vulnerable browser (Chromium, Safari, or other WebKit based browsers) or other vulnerable software (like iTunes)

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by "miaubiz".
- This vulnerability is mentioned across multiple platforms: Chromium, iOS, and iTunes, indicating a common underlying WebKit component vulnerability.
- The severity is rated as "High" in Chrome release notes, and as "normal" in Gentoo's advisory.
