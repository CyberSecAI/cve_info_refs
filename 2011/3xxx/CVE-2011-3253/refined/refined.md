- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CalDAV did not check that the SSL certificate presented by the server was trusted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of SSL certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with a privileged network position could intercept user credentials or other sensitive information from a CalDAV calendar server.
- **Attack vectors:** Man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position (e.g., able to intercept network traffic between the iOS device and the CalDAV server).
