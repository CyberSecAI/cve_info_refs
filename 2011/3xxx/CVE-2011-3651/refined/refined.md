  "CVE-2011-3651": {
    "Description": "The issue is related to how let-block variable initializers are handled in the JavaScript engine. Specifically, the initializers are statically outside the let-scope but dynamically inside it. This leads to incorrect scope resolution for JSOP_NAME opcodes, potentially causing reads or writes to inner variables when static analysis anticipates otherwise. This can lead to an exploitable vulnerability in the JIT.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect scope handling of let-block variable initializers in the JavaScript engine's compiler.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Incorrect scope resolution for JSOP_NAME opcodes",
      "Potential for reading/writing inner variables that static analysis doesn't expect",
      "Possibility of JIT exploitation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code execution through exploitation of the JavaScript JIT.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation of JavaScript code that uses let-block variables with functions that capture variables from the outer scope.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to introduce JavaScript code with specific patterns that trigger the vulnerability, such as code that includes escaping functions with upvars within a let statement."
  },
  "CVE-2011-3652": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of memory allocation failures within the networking cache component. When the allocation of a buffer fails while flattening a string, the code does not properly set the validity flag, leading to a use-after-free condition during the subsequent string operations, triggering a crash during a datamove operation at memcpy.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Unchecked allocation failure when flattening a string, leading to an invalid memory access.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Unchecked allocation failure",
      "Incorrect handling of string object validity flag",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability",
	  "Memory corruption",
	  "Potential for arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption leading to a crash and potential arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially control the memory at the location memcpy is writing to.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitable by triggering a specific JavaScript that causes the flattening of an excessively long string in the networking cache, leading to a memory allocation failure.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to cause an out-of-memory condition via javascript code that leads to large string allocation in the cache."
  },
    "CVE-2011-3654": {
        "Description": "The vulnerability is a crash caused by an SVG `<mpath>` element linking to a non-SVG element, leading to a potentially exploitable crash",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper handling of SVG `<mpath>` elements linking to non-SVG elements",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
          "Unchecked resource type",
	  "Potential use-after-free or other memory corruption scenario",
	    "Potentially exploitable crash"
        ],
       "Impact of exploitation": "Potentially exploitable crash, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution",
        "Attack vectors": "Crafted SVG code",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to load a crafted SVG file"
