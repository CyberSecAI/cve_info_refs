- **Root cause:** A logic error in the kernel's handling of file deletions in directories with the sticky bit.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Logic error in file deletion handling in directories with the sticky bit set.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user may be able to delete another user's files within a shared directory that has the sticky bit set.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires a shared directory with the sticky bit set and an unprivileged user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unprivileged user must have access to a shared directory where they do not own the files, but the directory has the sticky bit set.
