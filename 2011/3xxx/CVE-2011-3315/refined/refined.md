Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to **improper input validation** in Cisco Unified Communications Manager, Cisco Unified Contact Center Express, and Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response. This allows an attacker to traverse the filesystem directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is a directory traversal vulnerability. This allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended web server root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Retrieval:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can retrieve arbitrary files from the filesystem. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, configuration files, or other critical information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Specially Crafted URL:** An attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted URL to the affected system.
*   **Ports:** The vulnerability is exploitable over TCP port 8080 for versions 6.0(x) and 7.0(x), and over TCP port 9080 for versions starting with 8.0(x) of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response. Note that port 8080 could be reconfigured on the server. The Cisco Unified Communications Manager web service runs on port 8080.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any special privileges on the target system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the vulnerable services.

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.8 and a temporal score of 6.4. The vector string is AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C.
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Cisco Unified Communications Manager 6.x, 7.x, and 8.x
    *   Cisco Unified Contact Center Express 6.0(x), 7.0(x), 8.0(x), and 8.5(x)
    *   Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response 6.0(x), 7.0(x), 8.0(x), and 8.5(x)
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   **Reported By:** Felix "FX" Lindner of Recurity Labs reported the vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager. The Vulnerability Research Team of Digital Defense, Inc. reported the vulnerability in Cisco Unified Contact Center Express and Cisco Unified IP Interactive Voice Response.
*   **Mitigations:** There are mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network.
