The provided content discusses a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla, but it is not related to CVE-2011-3802. The email thread discusses a different information disclosure vulnerability in Joomla and assigns CVE-2011-2488 to it. The email also mentions a path disclosure issue in Joomla 1.6.1 and links to a blog post about it, as well as a list of similar vulnerabilities in other PHP CMS applications. However, this is still separate from CVE-2011-3802

The content is therefore **UNRELATED** to CVE-2011-3802.
