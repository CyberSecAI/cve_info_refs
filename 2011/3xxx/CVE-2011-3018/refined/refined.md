Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3018

**Description:** Heap overflow in path rendering.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a heap overflow during path rendering within Google Chrome.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap overflow:** A heap buffer overflow occurs during the process of rendering paths, which allows data to be written beyond the allocated memory region. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the browser. This could enable attackers to take control of the user's system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **System compromise:** A heap overflow vulnerability is considered a serious security risk, because it has the potential for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Path rendering:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted path during the rendering process.
*   **Web pages:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by embedding malicious content within a webpage that, when rendered by Chrome, triggers the heap overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to craft malicious path data:** An attacker needs to be able to create a specific set of path data to trigger the overflow during rendering.
*   **Web server/website access:** The attacker would need to host the malicious content on a web server or inject it into a legitimate site.
*   **User interaction**: The user would need to visit the malicious website using a vulnerable version of Google Chrome.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was found by Aki Helin of OUSPG.
*   The fix is included in Chrome Stable channel version 17.0.963.56
*   This vulnerability was rated as "High" severity.
