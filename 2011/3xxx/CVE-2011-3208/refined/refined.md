{
  "CVE-2011-3208": {
    "Description": "A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the NNTP server (nntpd) implementation of cyrus-imapd. This can be exploited by remote attackers via crafted NNTP commands.",
    "Root cause": "A buffer overflow exists in the `split_wildmats` function of the NNTP server implementation.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful attack can lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable server, potentially causing a crash or allowing an attacker to gain control of the system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Network",
       "NNTP commands"
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send crafted NNTP commands to the vulnerable server. If the 'allowanonymouslogin' option is set, this can be done without authentication."
