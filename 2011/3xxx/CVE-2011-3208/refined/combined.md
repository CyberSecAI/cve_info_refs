How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : cyrus-imapd-2.2
Vulnerability  : multiple
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : none
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3372 CVE-2011-3208

Multiple security issues have been discovered in cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable
mail system designed for use in enterprise environments.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-3208

    Coverity discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the NNTP server
    implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd.  An attacker can exploit this
    flaw via several crafted NNTP commands to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-3372

    Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research discovered that the command processing
    of the NNTP server implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd is not properly
    implementing access restrictions for certain commands and is not checking
    for a complete, successful authentication.  An attacker can use this flaw
    to bypass access restrictions for some commands and, e.g. exploit
    CVE-2011-3208 without proper authentication.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2_2.2.13-14+lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2_2.2.13-19+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.12-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-31 21:18:16 UTC  ``` A remotely exploitable buffer overflow flaw was found in Cyrus' nntpd.  A malicious NNTP client would be able to exploit this to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable nntpd server.  If the 'allowanonymouslogin' option was set in imapd.conf, it could be done without authentication.  When compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE (the default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, as well as Fedora), this flaw is not exploitable and will result in a crash of the nntpd service.  The following patch will correct the flaw:  diff --git a/imap/nntpd.c b/imap/nntpd.c index 56405d3..6b30174 100644 --- a/imap/nntpd.c +++ b/imap/nntpd.c @@ -4131,7 +4131,8 @@ static struct wildmat *split_wildmats(char *str)         else if (*c == '@') wild[n].not = -1;   /* absolute not (feeding) */         else wild[n].not = 0;  -       strcpy(p, wild[n].not ? c + 1 : c); +       strncpy(p, wild[n].not ? c + 1 : c, pattern+sizeof(pattern) - p); +       pattern[sizeof(pattern)-1] = '\0';         wild[n++].pat = xstrdup(pattern);      } while (c != str);      wild[n].pat = NULL;   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-01 17:57:41 UTC  ``` This issue has the name [CVE-2011-3208](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3208) and will be made public on 8 Sep 2011.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-02 15:04:45 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c0)) > When compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE (the default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 > and 6, as well as Fedora), this flaw is not exploitable and will result in a > crash of the nntpd service.  This bug is not caught by FORTIFY_SOURCE as upstream indicated, but the overflow may be detected later if compiled with stack protector (SSP).  cyrus-imapd in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 have SSP enabled, which increases exploit difficulty.  The code is executed in the nntpd child process running as user cyrus.  The crash of the process only affects attacker's connection and does not impact nntpd service availability.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-05 10:34:50 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Greg Banks for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-08 20:02:47 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream versions 2.3.17 and 2.4.11 released: <http://asg.andrew.cmu.edu/archive/message.php?mailbox=archive.cyrus-announce&msg=199> <http://asg.andrew.cmu.edu/archive/message.php?mailbox=archive.cyrus-announce&msg=200>  Upstream git commit: <http://git.cyrusimap.org/cyrus-imapd/commit/?id=0f8f026699829b65733c3081657b24e2174f4f4d>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-08 20:03:34 UTC  ``` Created cyrus-imapd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 736838](show_bug.cgi?id=736838 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3208 cyrus-imapd: nntpd buffer overflow in split_wildmats() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=734926#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-19 17:54:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1317 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1317.html>   ``` |  |
