  "CVE-2011-3609": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2011-3609",
      "Description": "A CSRF issue was found in JBoss Application Server 7 before 7.1.0. JBoss did not properly restrict access to the management console information (for example via the \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" HTTP access control flag). This can lead to unauthorized information leak if a user with admin privileges visits a specially-crafted web page provided by a remote attacker."
    },
    "Technical Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The JBoss Application Server did not properly restrict access to the management console information, specifically by not specifying a list of valid URIs through the \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\" HTTP header.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)",
        "Improper Access Control"
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker can craft a malicious web page. When a user with JBoss Application Server administrator privileges visits this page, the attacker can potentially leak unauthorized information.",
       "Attack Vectors": [
        "A remote attacker hosts a specially crafted web page.",
        "A victim with administrative privileges visits the malicious webpage while also logged into the JBoss application server."
        ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to host a malicious webpage.",
         "The attacker needs to trick a JBoss Application Server administrator into visiting the webpage."
         ]
    },
     "Affected Components": [
        "JBoss Application Server version 7 prior to 7.1.0 Beta 1"
    ],
    "Mitigation": {
    "Fix": "The issue was resolved in JBoss AS 7.1.0 Beta 1 by introducing CSRF token protection.",
     "Workaround": "Applying authentication on the JBoss management interface and disabling the \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * header\"."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
        "Notes": "This issue affects community JBoss AS 7 prior to 7.1.0 Beta 1. It does not affect components shipped with any Red Hat products. The vulnerability can be exploited by submitting a POST request with a non-encoded JSON body within a 'text/plain' content type.",
        "Acknowledgements": "Red Hat thanks David Black for reporting this issue.",
       "RedHat Bugzilla": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=743006"
