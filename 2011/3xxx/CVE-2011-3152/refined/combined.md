How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

The way DistUpgrade/DistUpgradeFetcherCore.py uses tarfile is dangerous ...

The python documentation for tarfile[0] has a warning which states:

'Warning Never extract archives from untrusted sources without prior inspection. It is possible that files are created outside of path, e.g. members that have absolute filenames starting with "/" or filenames with two dots "..". '

However, the code flow does the following under run()

#1 download the release tar file ... via

   if not self.fetchDistUpgrader():

then it runs

#2 the vulnerable tarfile code via calling

if not self.extractDistUpgrader():

#3 after which it verifies the upgrade files ...

        if not self.verifyDistUprader():

In the extractDistUpgrader method the vulnerable use of tarfile as follows:

    def extractDistUpgrader(self):

          # extract the tarbal

          fname = os.path.join(self.tmpdir,os.path.basename(self.uri))

          print "extracting '%s'" % os.path.basename(fname)

          if not os.path.exists(fname):

              return False

          try:

              tar = tarfile.open(self.tmpdir+"/"+os.path.basename(self.uri),"r")

              for tarinfo in tar:

                  tar.extract(tarinfo)

              tar.close()

As the tar.extract method is called on the 'tarinfo' which is not 'checked' or guarded against ../'s (path traversal) containing file-names it would appear that the code is vulnerable to path traversal ...

Thanks for your bugreport and sorry for my slow reply. I was traveling during the previous days.

Your analysis is exactly right, this code is broken, I attach a fix.

The previous patch is not sufficient. This new one fixes a additional MitM attack where a attacker can

give a modified meta-release file to bypass the authentication. This makes the previous one obsolete.

I wasn't sure if this code was actually used or not. It looks like when a cd of a new release is inserted the code in DistUpgradeController will run --> up and into the prepare method if the user selects the option to get new updates from the internet then the self.\_tryUpdateSelf method is called which does this -->

from DistUpgradeFetcherSelf import DistUpgradeFetcherSelf

where DistUpgradeFetcherSelf is a subclass of DistUpgradeFetcherCore -- and the \_tryUpdateSelf will create and invoke the run() (vulnerable) method of DistUpgradeFetcherSelf(which is inherited from DistUpgradeFetcherCore).

If this is correct it means that cd triggered updates may permit a remote attacker to remotely compromise a vulnerable machine during the upgrade process if the option to upgrade from the network is selected.

Hey David, this is indeed the case :( What we can do is to fix update-notifier that will watch for the cdrom insert events and runs the upgrade. We need to add a step here that automatically patches the broken code. I will work on this shortly (I'm currently at the Ubuntu Developer Conference).

For the version in precise we need to a) fix the code b) move cdromupgrade into update-manager-core so that we can ship security updates for it to networked systems independently from the CD.

The case that is not handled with the update-notifier fix outlined above is when someone runs the cdromupgrade script on the CD by hand. I don't really see a way currently to fix this except for patch python itself and fail if it encounters the DistUpgradeFetcherCore.py file with a certain sha1.

No problem :-)

Right so you could do a comparison using os.path.realpath for where the file from the tar would end up and skip evil file-names. I don't think this is a real issue (you could remove the \_\_init\_\_ code ... to make it harder to call if no one is using it :-) ).

Sorry again for the slowness, I'm back from UDS now, still fighting jetlag, but mostly good.

The attached patch should fix most people who use the normal way of doing a cdromupgrade via the update-notifier

prompt.

I did not actually test that yet, but once I got a CD and the download is done I will.

Is there a timeline on a release fix for this issue. Also I noticed that /usr/bin/do-release-upgrade appears to run into the vulnerable code as well (during an update).

I tested the patch now and it turns out that there is a typo in it.

Once that got fixed it works for me for:

natty->oneiric: yes

maverick->natty: yes

lucid->maverick: yes (attached patch has a trivial conflict though)

what I did was to get the natty/maverick/lucid update-notitifer, patch it, build it, insert a cdrom and verify that the update-notifier would patch the upgrader before it executes it.

# USN-1284-1: Update Manager vulnerabilities

28 November 2011

Update Manager could be made to overwrite files as the administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [update-manager](/security/cves?package=update-manager) - GNOME application that manages apt updates
* [update-notifier](/security/cves?package=update-notifier) - Daemon which notifies about package updates

## Details

David Black discovered that Update Manager incorrectly extracted the

downloaded upgrade tarball before verifying its GPG signature. If a remote

attacker were able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could

potentially be used to replace arbitrary files. ([CVE-2011-3152](/security/CVE-2011-3152))

David Black discovered that Update Manager created a temporary directory

in an insecure fashion. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to

read the XAUTHORITY file of the user performing the upgrade.

([CVE-2011-3154](/security/CVE-2011-3154))

This update also adds a hotfix to Update Notifier to handle cases where the

upgrade is being performed from CD media.
