Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3152:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `tarfile` module in the `DistUpgradeFetcherCore.py` script within the Ubuntu Update Manager. Specifically, the script extracts a downloaded tar archive *before* verifying its GPG signature. This allows an attacker to potentially insert malicious files into the extracted directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The `tar.extract(tarinfo)` method is used to extract files from the archive without prior validation of filenames. A malicious tar archive could contain filenames with `../` sequences, leading to files being written outside of the intended extraction directory and potentially overwriting critical system files.

*   **Insecure Extraction:** The script doesn't verify the GPG signature of the downloaded tar archive before extracting its contents which would prevent from man in the middle attacks by altering the content of the archive.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By overwriting system files, an attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** A remote attacker performing a MitM attack could intercept the download of the upgrade tarball and replace it with a malicious archive.
*   **Network Upgrade:** When upgrading from the network, the vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious actor to inject malicious files during the upgrade process.
*   **CD/DVD Upgrade:** During a CD/DVD upgrade, if the user selects to get updates from the internet an attacker could perform MitM on that request. Additionally if a user executes the cdromupgrade script on the CD by hand the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept the download of the upgrade tarball.
*   The attacker needs to be able to modify the downloaded tarball with malicious files and filenames containing path traversal sequences.
*   For CD/DVD upgrades, the attacker needs to be able to perform a MitM attack during the network request if the user selects the option to get new updates from the internet or if a user executes the `cdromupgrade` script on the CD by hand.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in multiple versions of Ubuntu, including Hardy, Lucid, Maverick, Natty, Oneiric and Precise.
*   The fix involves verifying the signature before unpacking the tarball.
*   A hotfix was also added to `update-notifier` to patch the vulnerable code when upgrading from CD media.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2011-3152.
