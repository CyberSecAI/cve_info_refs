Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The setup script for dtc (Domain Technologie Control) incorrectly set the permissions of the `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file, making it world-readable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary issue is that the configuration file (`/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`) was made readable by all users on the system (world-readable). This is a security risk since it contains sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` file contained the password for the MySQL user (`dtcdaemons`) used by the dtc application. This would allow any local user to gain access to the dtc database, potentially allowing them to modify user data, or cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by any local user on the system where dtc is installed. Any user with access to the system could read the contents of `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf`.
- **File System Access:** Attackers would need to be able to read the contents of the configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have local user access to the server running dtc. No special privileges are required to exploit the world-readable nature of the file.
