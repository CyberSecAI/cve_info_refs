Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error within the `prepare_exec()` function in the `src/exec.c` file of Logsurfer.
- This double-free is triggered due to insufficient handling of an error condition returned by the `get_word()` function when it fails to parse input correctly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double-Free:**  The core issue is that memory is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A remote attacker can inject specially crafted strings into a log file that Logsurfer processes. This leads to the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Logsurfer user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Log File Injection:** Attackers inject malicious strings into log files that are monitored by Logsurfer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write to or influence the content of log files that Logsurfer is actively monitoring.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges or credentials beyond being able to influence the log files.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Logsurfer versions 1.5b and earlier, and Logsurfer+ versions 1.7 and earlier.
- A patch for the vulnerability is available and versions 1.8 and greater are not vulnerable.
- The Gentoo Security Advisory for this issue is GLSA 201201-04.
