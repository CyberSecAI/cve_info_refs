{
  "CVE-2011-3624": {
    "description": "Various methods in WEBrick::HTTPRequest in Ruby 1.9.2 and 1.8.7 and earlier do not validate the X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host and X-Forwarded-Server headers in requests, which might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a crafted header.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because the `WEBrick::HTTPRequest` class in Ruby does not properly validate the `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-Server` headers.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of HTTP headers.",
        "Lack of sanitization of data from `X-Forwarded-*` headers."
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary text into log files, potentially leading to log injection attacks, or bypass intended address parsing by crafting malicious headers.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request containing malicious `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, or `X-Forwarded-Server` headers to a vulnerable server.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This does not require any special privileges or access to the server. If an intermediate proxy is used, the attacker needs to be able to inject the malicious headers into the request to the server.",
      "additional_details": [
        "The issue affects `HTTPRequest#host`, `HTTPRequest#port`, `HTTPRequest#server_name`, `HTTPRequest#remote_ip`, `HTTPRequest#ssl?` and `HTTPRequest#meta_vars` properties.",
         "The vulnerability is due to WEBrick offering these data as-is from the HTTP header and expecting users to handle them appropriately, rather than properly validating them.",
         "The fix is complex because it's not only `x-forwarded-for` which causes the issue, and 'client-ip' needs to be considered as well.",
          "Documentation may be enough for `server_name`"
      ]
    }
