      {
        "root_cause": "The `mkdumprd` utility copies all .ssh keys of the root user into the vmcore file.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Information leak due to inclusion of potentially confidential SSH keys in the vmcore file"

        "attack_vectors": [
          "A local attacker who is able to read the world-readable vmcore file can obtain confidential SSH keys."

    ],
    "description": "The `mkdumprd` utility copies all .ssh keys of the root user into the vmcore file, potentially leading to an information leak.",
        "remediation": "The vulnerability is resolved by including only the SSH client configuration, known hosts files, and the SSH key configured via the newly introduced sshkey option in `/etc/kdump.conf`. The default key is generated when running the `service kdump propagate` command (`/root/.ssh/kdump_id_rsa`)."
