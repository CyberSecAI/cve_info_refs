Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-3256:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in FreeType's handling of Type 1 fonts. Specifically, a missing input sanitization in glyph handling was identified.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory corruption due to insufficient input validation when processing font data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to:
  - Denial of service (application crash, system hang)
  - Arbitrary code execution, potentially giving an attacker control over the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the processing of maliciously crafted fonts. These can be embedded in:
    - Documents (like PDF files)
    - Web pages
    - Movie files
    - Other media types
-  An attacker would need to get the user to open a file or access a resource containing this malicious font.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted font file to trigger the vulnerability
- An attacker needs to trick the user into opening a document or file that contains the malicious font or visit a web page that uses it
- The attacker does not require a privileged network position.
