Debian Bug     : 670124

Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool.  As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead
of backporting the patches.

This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2+dfsg-1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), those problems have been fixed in version 3.3.2+dfsg-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

* Various security hardening by [Alexander Concha](http://www.buayacorp.com).
* Taxonomy query hardening by [John Lamansky](http://johnlamansky.com/wordpress).
* Prevent sniffing out user names of non-authors by using canonical redirects. Props [Verónica Valeros](http://www.talsoft.com.ar).
* Media security fixes by Richard Lundeen of [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/), Jesse Ou of [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/), and [Microsoft Vulnerability Research](http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/default.aspx).
* Improves file upload security on hosts with dangerous security settings.
* Cleans up old WordPress import files if the import does not finish.
* Introduce “clickjacking” protection in modern browsers on admin and login pages.

Consult the [change log](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/3.1/?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=18023&stop_rev=17805&limit=100) for more details.

### WordPress 3.2 Beta 2 also available

In other news, our development of WordPress 3.2 development continues right on schedule. We released [Beta 1](https://wordpress.org/news/2011/05/wordpress-3-2-beta-1/) thirteen days ago, and today we’re putting out Beta 2 for your testing pleasure.

This is still beta software, so **we don’t recommend that you use it on production sites**. But if you’re a plugin developer, a theme developer, or a site administrator, **you should be running this on your test environments** and [reporting any bugs](https://codex.wordpress.org/Reporting_Bugs) you find. If you’re a WordPress user who wants to open your presents early, take advantage of WordPress’ famous 5-minute install and spin up a secondary test site. Let us know what you think!

The plan is to start putting out release candidates in early June, and to release WordPress 3.2 by the end of the month. The more you help us iron out issues during the beta period, the more likely we are to hit those dates. To misappropriate and mangle a quote from Mahatma Gandhi: “Be the punctuality you want to see in the WordPress.” In other words, test now!

Here are some of the things that changed since Beta 1:

* [Google Chrome Frame](http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/) is now supported in the admin, if you have it installed. This is especially useful for IE 6 users (remember, IE 6 is otherwise deprecated for the admin).
* The admin is less ugly in IE 7.
* The blue admin color scheme has caught up to the grey one, and is ready for testing.
* We are now bundling jQuery 1.6.1. You should test any JS that uses jQuery. WordPress JavaScript guru Andrew Ozz has [a post with more info](http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/jquery-updates-in-wordpress-3-2/).
