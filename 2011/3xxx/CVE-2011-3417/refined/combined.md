# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-100 - Critical

## Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2638420)

Published: December 29, 2011 | Updated: July 10, 2012

**Version:** 1.6

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves one publicly disclosed vulnerability and three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft .NET Framework. The most severe of these vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an unauthenticated attacker sends a specially crafted web request to the target site. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action in the context of an existing account on the ASP.NET site, including executing arbitrary commands. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to register an account on the ASP.NET site, and must know an existing user name.

This security update is rated Critical for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1, Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1, and Microsoft .NET Framework 4 on all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how the .NET Framework handles specially crafted requests, and how the ASP.NET Framework authenticates users and handles cached content. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2659883](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2659883).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers consider applying the security update using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2638420](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2638420) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

The following software have been tested to determine which versions or editions are affected. Other versions or editions are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, visit [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742).

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Why was this bulletin revised on** **May22, 2012?**

Microsoft revised this bulletin to announce a detection change for KB2656352 for Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 to correct an installation issue. This is a detection change only. There were no changes to the security update files. Customers who have already successfully updated their systems do not need to take any action.

**Is this bulletin related to MS12-035, Vulnerabilities in .NET Framework Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2693777)?**

Yes. KB2656353, offered in this bulletin, also addresses CVE-2012-0160 and CVE-2012-0161, which are documented in [MS12-035](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=246970).

**Are Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5** **on Windows** **Developer Previewaffected by this vulnerability?**

Yes. This vulnerability was reported after the release of the Windows Developer Preview. Customers running the Developer Preview software are encouraged to download and apply the update to their systems. For more information, including Microsoft Download Center links, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base Articles:

| Affected Software | Microsoft Knowledge Base Article |
| --- | --- |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2656360](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656360) |
| Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 on Windows Developer Preview | [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2656354](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2656354) |

Security updates are available from [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) and [Windows Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21130).

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. In addition to the changes that are listed in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin, this update includes functional changes to the ASP.NET framework. The update limits the maximum number of form keys, files, and JSON members to 1000 in a request. This change results in ASP.NET applications rejecting requests having greater than 1000 of such elements. Clients making requests of these types will be denied and will see an error message in their browsers (typically an error 500). This limit can be configured per application. Please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2661403](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2661403).

The update also changes the format of forms authentication tickets in a way that could be incompatible with the older version of forms authentication tickets. For example, after installing this update, in web farm environments where some servers are updated while others are not, there may be the case where the updated servers could generate forms authentication tickets that are incompatible on non-updated servers. Please see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2661404](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2661404).

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**How do I determine which version of the Microsoft .NET Framework is installed?**

You can install and run multiple versions of the .NET Framework on a system, and you can install the versions in any order. There are several ways to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are currently installed. For more information, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 318785](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785).

**What is the difference between .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile?**

The .NET Framework version 4 redistributable packages are available in two profiles: .NET Framework 4 and .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. The .NET Framework 4 Client Profile is a subset of the .NET Framework 4 profile that is optimized for client applications. It provides functionality for most client applications, including Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Forms, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and ClickOnce features. This enables faster deployment and a smaller install package for applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile. For more information, see the MSDN article, [.NET Framework Client Profile](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc656912.aspx).

**There are two updates listed for the version of the Microsoft .NET Framework installed on my system. Do I need to install both updates?**

Yes. Customers should apply all updates offered for the software installed on their systems.

**Do I need to install these security updates in a particular sequence?**

No. Multiple updates for one version of the .NET Framework can be applied in any sequence. We recommend that multiple updates for different versions of the .NET Framework be applied in sequence from lowest version number to highest, however that sequence is not required.

**I have .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed; this version is not listed among the affected software in this bulletin. Do I need to install an update?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installer chains in the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup, so installing the former also installs the latter. Therefore, customers who have the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 installed need to install security updates for the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I have .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed. Do I need to install any additional updates?**

This bulletin describes a vulnerability in the .NET Framework 2.0 feature layer and the .NET Framework 4. The .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installer chains in both the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2 setup and the .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 setup. Therefore, customers who have the .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 installed also need to install security updates for the .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 2.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product life cycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) website.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities.

## Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that ASP.NET Framework handles specially crafted requests, causing a hash collision. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could send a small number of specially crafted requests to an ASP.NET server, causing performance to degrade significantly enough to cause a denial of service condition.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3414](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3414).

#### Mitigating Factors for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, IIS is not enabled on any Windows operating system
* Sites that disallow application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data HTTP content types are not vulnerable
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET Framework is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for Collisions in HashTable May Cause DoS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3414

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Configuration-based workaround**

  The following workaround configures the limit of the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client. Decreasing the maximum request size will decrease the susceptibility of the ASP.NET server to a denial of service attack.

  **Note:** Please back up your configuration before you make any changes to it.

  This configuration value can be applied globally to all ASP.NET sites on a server by adding the entry to root web.config or applicationhost.config. Alternatively, this configuration can be restricted to a particular site or application by adding it to a web.config file for the particular site or application. For more information on ASP.NET configuration, please reference the MSDN article [ASP.NET Configuration Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms178683.aspx).

  1. If your application uses ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 200 KB.

     ```
     <configuration>

     ```

<system.web>
<httpruntime maxrequestlength="200â />
</system.web>
</configuration>
```

```
2.  If your application does not use ASP.NET ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 20 KB.

    ```
    &lt;configuration&gt;
        &lt;system.web&gt;
        &lt;httpRuntime maxRequestLength=">

```

</system.web>
```

```
2.  If your application does not use ASP.NET ViewState, add the following configuration in the appropriate ASP.NET configuration file to limit the maximum request size that ASP.NET will accept from a client to 20 KB.

    ```
    <configuration>

```

<system.web>
<httpruntime maxrequestlength="20â />
</system.web>
</configuration>
```

```
For more information on the maxRequestLength configuration option, please refer to MSDN documentation on the [httpRuntime Element](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/e1f13641.aspx).

**Note:** Increasing the default HTTP querystring and request header size limits will increase the susceptibility of the server to the denial of service issue being described in this advisory. For more information about how to set these limits, see [Http.sys registry settings for IIS](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/820129).

**Impact of workaround:** Client requests that exceed the configured maxRequestLength will result in a ConfigurationErrorsException thrown on the server-side and an http error status returned to the client. The limits configured previously should be used as a baseline and can be adjusted to avoid application failures. Configuring the maxRequestLength value with a smaller value also reduces the serverâs susceptibility to this particular denial of service. Applications that accept client file uploads and those that generate a large viewstate are examples of applications that may be impacted by this workaround.

After you apply this workaround, the following client request failure may appear in Application event log.

```
    Event code: 3004
    Event message: Post size exceeded allowed limits.
     Exception information:
          Exception type: HttpException
          Exception message: Maximum request length exceeded.
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.GetEntireRawContent()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.FillInFormCollection()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_Form()
    at System.Web.HttpRequest.get_HasForm()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.GetCollectionBasedOnMethod(Boolean dontReturnNull)
    at System.Web.UI.Page.DeterminePostBackMode()
    at System.Web.UI.Page.ProcessRequestMain(Boolean includeStagesBeforeAsyncPoint, Boolean includeStagesAfterAsyncPoint)
```

Alternatively, the request failure may result in the following entry in an IIS log file.

```
    #Fields: s-ip cs-method cs-uri-stem cs-uri-query s-port cs-username c-ip cs(User-Agent) sc-status sc-substatus sc-win32-status time-taken
```

```
    127.0.0.1 POST /webSite/Default.aspx - 80 - 127.0.0.1 - 500 0 0 1268
```

**Removing workaround:** To undo the workaround, remove the configuration sections that were added in this workaround or revert to a backup of the configuration before the workarounds.

#### FAQ for Insecure Redirect in .NET Form Authentication Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3415

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a spoofing vulnerability. This vulnerability could enable an attacker to redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. The attacker could then perform a phishing attack to gain information from the user they did not intend to disclose. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

**What is phishing?**

Online phishing (pronounced like fishing) is a way to trick computer users into revealing personal or financial information through a fraudulent email message or website. A common online phishing scam starts with an email message that resembles an official notice from a trusted source, such as a bank, credit card company, or reputable online merchant. In the email message, recipients are directed to a fraudulent website where they are asked to provide personal information, such as an account number or password. This information is then usually used for identity theft.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework incorrectly verifies return URLs during the forms authentication process.

**What is Forms Authentication in ASP.NET?**

Forms authentication uses an authentication ticket that is created when a user logs on to a site, and then it tracks the user throughout the site. The forms authentication ticket is usually contained inside a cookie. However, ASP.NET version 2.0 supports cookieless forms authentication, which results in the ticket being passed in a query string. For more information, see the MSDN article, [Explained: Forms Authentication in ASP.NET 2.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff647070.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could redirect a user to a website of the attacker's choosing without the user's knowledge. This vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code or to elevate their user rights directly, but it could be used to further compromise user information intended to remain private.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could create a specially crafted URL and convince a user to click it. After a user logs in to an expected website, the attacker then redirects the user to a website controlled by the attacker. Then, the attacker could convince the user to divulge information otherwise intended to remain private. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website after logging in to an expected website.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet-facing systems with ASP.NET installed are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal websites that use ASP.NET forms authentication can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**What does the update do?**

## ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that .NET Framework authenticates users. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would need to be able to register an account on the ASP.NET application, and must know an existing account name for a targeted user. The attacker could then craft a special web request using a previously registered account name to gain access to that account. The attacker could then take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3416](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3416).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* An attacker must be able to register an account on the ASP.NET application, and must know an existing user name.
* By default, installing ASP.NET does not enable Forms Authentication. It has to be explicitly configured per-application to be enabled.
* By default, IIS is not installed.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set ticketCompatibilityMode to Framework40**

  This only applies to sites that are running ASP.NET 4 and newer because the ticketCompatibilityMode setting was introduced in ASP.NET v4.0.

  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the ticketCompatibilityMode to Framework40. Note that the default value for this setting is "Framework20"

     ```
     <system.web>

     ```

```
```
**How to undo the workaround.**

Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.

```

* **Disable Forms Authentication in web.config**
  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set the authentication mode to either Windows, Passport or None.

     ```
     <system.web>

       <authentication mode="Windows | Passport | None">

     ```

</system.web>
```

```
    Details of each mode can be found at </https:><https:>.

    **How to undo the workaround.**

    Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.

#### FAQ for ASP.Net Forms Authentication Bypass Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3416

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an elevation of privilege vulnerability where a remote unauthenticated attacker can gain access to another account on the ASP.NET application, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the site in the context of the targeted user.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused when the ASP.NET Framework incorrectly authenticates specially crafted usernames.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would first need to have knowledge of an existing account name to impersonate on the site. The attacker could then craft a special web request using a previously registered account name to gain access to that account. The attacker could then take any action in the context of the targeted user, including executing arbitrary commands on the site.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Internet-facing systems with ASP.NET installed are primarily at risk from this vulnerability. In addition, internal websites that use ASP.NET forms authentication can be at risk from this vulnerability.

**If my website uses a web farm, will I need to update all the** **computers** **in the web farm?**

Yes. This update changes the format of the forms authentication ticket in a way that is incompatible with the earlier format. This means that tickets generated by using the new behavior cannot be read by computers using the old behavior, and vice versa. Administrators whose applications use forms-based authentication must take specific steps when deploying this security update to ensure that all of their servers switch to the new behavior simultaneously.

For more information, see the [Microsoft TechNet Article 2659968](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2659968).

**Is it possible to update the** **computers** **in my web farm one at a time** **instead ofall at the same time?**

Yes. If it is not feasible to deploy MS11-100 to all the servers in a given web farm simultaneously, you can set a compatibility switch in your web.config or machine.config file before installing the update to force the old behavior after the update is installed. The compatibility switch to use is as follows:

```
<appsettings>
<add key="aspnet:UseLegacyFormsAuthenticationTicketCompatibility" value="true">
</add></appsettings>

```

Setting this switch will allow web farms with only some machines updated to continue functioning correctly. However, it is important to know that computers with the configuration switch set will be in an insecure state, and will not benefit from the fix in this security update. After MS11-100 has been deployed to all the computers in a farm, the configuration switch must be removed to enable the new, secure behavior.

**Will this update honor my siteâs forms authentication ticketCompatibilityMode setting?**

No. Since the fix in this security update changes the format of forms authentication tickets, the ticketCompatibilityMode configuration setting is no longer supported once MS11-100 is installed.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting how the ASP.NET Framework authenticates users.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that ASP.NET Framework handles cached content when Forms Authentication is used with sliding expiry. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take any action including executing arbitrary commands that the user could take on the site in the context of the target user. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted link to the user and convincing the user to click the link. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by clicking a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-3417](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3417).

#### Mitigating Factors for ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* By default, ASP.NET responses are not cached by the OutputCache. The developer of the site has to opt in to output caching through the OutputCache directive on a page.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the target user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, IIS is not installed on any affected operating system version. Only customers who manually install this are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.
* By default, ASP.NET is not installed when .NET is installed. Only customers who manually install and enable ASP.NET are likely to be vulnerable to this issue.

#### Workarounds for ASP.NET Forms Authentication Ticket Caching Vulnerability - CVE-2011-3417

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Restrict forms authentication cookies to SSL channels**

  Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy.

  Set requireSSL="true" on the <forms> element, as shown in the following code.

  ```
      <forms loginurl="Secure\Login.aspx" requiressl="true">

  ```

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.
* **Disable sliding expiration for forms authentication cookies**

  1. Open the application or global web.config file after taking a backup copy
  2. Set slidingExpiration="false" on the <forms> element, as shown in the following code.

     ```
     </forms><forms slidingexpiration="false">

     ```

  **Impact of workaround.** Users would be forced to re-login after their tickets expire.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web.config file from your backup copy.
* **Disable OutputCache**

  1. Back up your web application folder.
  2. Remove all <%@ OutputCache %> directives in your web pages.
  3. If your website is an MVC application, also remove all OutputCache attributes from your controller actions.

  **Impact of workaround.** Users would be forced to re-login after their tickets expire.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  Restore your web application folder.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Server 2003 (all editions)

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches for Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1 Service Pack 1 on Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| **Setup Modes** |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| **Install Options** |  |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/nobackup** | Do not back up files for uninstall. |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrite OEM files without prompting. |
| \*\*/integrate:\*\**path* | Integrates the software updates into the Windows installation source files located at the path specified. Note that *:path* refers to the folder that contains the i386 folder. |
| **/ER** | Enable extended error reporting. |
| \*\*/d:\*\**path* | Specifies a backup directory for Windows Service Pack installation. *:path* indicates the destination folder for the backup files. The default backup location is *%Systemdrive%*\$ntservicepackuninstall$. |
| **/extract[:***path***]** | Extracts files without starting Setup. If "*:path*" is not included, you are prompted for the path of a destination folder to extract the files. If "*:path*" is used, the files are extracted to the specified destination folder. |
| **/hotpatch:disable** | Disables hotpatching functionality, and installs the cold patch only. |
| **Restart Options** |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| **Logging Options** |  |
| \*\*/log:\*\**path* | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates *%Windir%*\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Windows Vista (all editions)

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and then click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.
