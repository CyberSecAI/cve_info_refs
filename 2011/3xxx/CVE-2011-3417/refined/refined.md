Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-3417:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how the ASP.NET Framework handles cached content when Forms Authentication is used with sliding expiration. Specifically, it seems the framework does not properly invalidate cached content when authentication tickets expire, potentially leading to the reuse of stale credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of cached content in conjunction with forms authentication and sliding expiration.
- Potential reuse of old, expired authentication tickets.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain access to another user's account on the affected .NET application.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Once the attacker gains access, they could take any action that the legitimate user could, including executing arbitrary commands.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Specially crafted link:** An attacker could send a specially crafted link to a user and convince them to click it.
- **Email or Instant Messenger:** The attacker would need to convince the user to click the link, typically through email or an instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker doesn't need prior access or credentials to the target system.
- **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.
- **Knowledge of ASP.NET and Forms Authentication:** A degree of understanding of how ASP.NET handles authentication would likely be required to craft the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is specific to ASP.NET applications using forms authentication with sliding expiration enabled.
- The vulnerability exists because of how the .NET framework handles cached content in this configuration.
- Mitigations include restricting forms authentication cookies to SSL channels, disabling sliding expiration, or disabling OutputCache.
- The provided document also describes 3 other CVEs related to ASP.NET vulnerabilities, which are not included in this analysis but were fixed as a part of the same update.
