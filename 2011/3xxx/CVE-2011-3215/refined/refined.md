- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic error in the kernel's DMA protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The kernel permitted firewire DMA at loginwindow, boot, and shutdown states, but not at screen lock. This allowed for unauthorized access to the system's memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A person with physical access to the system could potentially access the user's password by exploiting the DMA vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: Physical access is required to perform the attack using firewire DMA.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the system and the ability to use firewire DMA. The attacker also needs to be present during loginwindow, boot or shutdown stages.
