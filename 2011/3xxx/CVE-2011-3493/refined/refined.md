- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A stack-based unicode buffer overflow exists in the `DH_OneSecondTick` function within the Cogent DataHub application. This overflow is triggered when processing specific commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow using unicode characters, which could lead to code execution when crafted input is provided
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and the vulnerability is triggered by sending specific commands (e.g., "domain", "report_domain", "register_datahub", "slave") to the service listening on TCP ports 4502 (plain text) or 4503 (SSL).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable service.
