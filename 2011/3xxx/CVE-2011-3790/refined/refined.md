Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a path disclosure vulnerability present in Joomla! 1.6.1 and likely other PHP CMS applications. This is due to the way the applications handle requests, unintentionally revealing the server's internal file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of server-side file paths. This information leak allows an attacker to gain knowledge of the application's directory structure, which can be leveraged for further attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can discover the exact location of files and directories within the server's file system, making it easier to locate sensitive configuration files, source code, and other potentially valuable information. This information can be used to plan other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Request Manipulation:** Attackers can likely manipulate web requests to trigger the path disclosure. The exact method isn't fully detailed but generally involves requesting a resource that exposes the file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. This typically means they have network access to the web application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to make web requests and interpret the server's response.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information references other path disclosure issues in various CMS applications.
*   The context suggests that this type of vulnerability is common among PHP CMS applications.
*   The email thread indicates that the specific Joomla! issue mentioned was initially reported in 2010 but assigned a CVE in 2011. However, this information is not directly relevant to CVE-2011-3790.
*   The vulnerability is described as being "server-side" issue.
* The provided google code archive is not relevant.

**Summary:**
The provided content describes a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! and other PHP CMS applications. The vulnerability allows attackers to gain information about server-side file paths by manipulating web requests, which can assist them in performing further attacks.
