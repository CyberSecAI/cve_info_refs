Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2011-3588 vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `kdump` and `mkdumprd` utilities used `StrictHostKeyChecking=no` by default in their OpenSSH integration. This setting disables the verification of the remote SSH server's host key.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure SSH Configuration:** The use of  `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`  allowed connections to remote SSH servers without verifying their host keys. This left kdump vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Impersonation of Kdump Server:** A malicious attacker, positioned on the local network, could impersonate the intended, correct kdump server.
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure:** Upon successful impersonation, the attacker would gain access to security-sensitive information contained in kdump core files (vmcore dumps).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker positioned on the local network between the system creating the core dump and the intended kdump server.
- **Network traffic interception:** The attacker could intercept communication, if `StrictHostKeyChecking` was disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Proximity:** The attacker would need to be positioned on the local network between the host and the kdump server.
- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept SSH traffic between the host and the target server.
- No specific user level privileges required.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in kexec-tools.
- The fix involves removing the  `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`  option, so the system's default ssh configuration is used. This will verify host keys, or prompt the user to verify if a host is unknown.
- The fix was implemented in the kexec-tools package, and was released in Red Hat advisories RHSA-2011:1532 (RHEL 6) and RHSA-2012:0152 (RHEL 5).
