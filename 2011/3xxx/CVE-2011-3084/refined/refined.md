Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from how Chromium handles links from internal pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core weakness is that links from internal pages were not being loaded in their own separate processes. This could potentially allow an attacker to bypass security restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
By not loading internal links in their own process, it exposes the browser to potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious internal pages. This could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could craft a malicious internal page containing specific links designed to exploit the improper process handling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to get a malicious internal page loaded in the context of the vulnerable Chromium browser.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix implemented ensures that links from internal pages are loaded in their own processes, thereby isolating them and mitigating the risk.
- This vulnerability is addressed in Chromium version 19.0.1084.46 and v8 version 3.9.24.21.
- The issue was credited to Brett Wilson of the Chromium development community.
