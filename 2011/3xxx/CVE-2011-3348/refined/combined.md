# [Error 503 using mod\_cluster](/message/624829#624829)

[![nichele](/people/nichele/avatar/46.png?a=-1)](/people/nichele)

**[nichele](/people/nichele)** Sep 5, 2011 12:50 PM

Hi All,

i'm using mod\_cluster in production but i'm having some 503.

I tried replacing mod\_cluster with mod\_proxy\_balancer and in such case i didn't have any 503 so i'm thinking to a misconfiguration of mod\_cluster.

My environemnt is composed by an instance of apache httpd ver. 2.2.19, and of 4 instances of tomcat 6.0.13 with mod\_cluster 1.1.2.

In any server.xml file i added:

  <Listener className="org.jboss.modcluster.catalina.ModClusterListener"

            advertise="false"

            proxyList="my-proxy:6666"

            maxAttempts="3"

            nodeTimeout="600"

            ping="30"

            loadMetricClass="org.jboss.modcluster.load.metric.impl.BusyConnectorsLoadMetric" />

In my httpd conf file i have:

Listen \*:6666

<VirtualHost \*:6666>

   <Directory />

      Order deny,allow

      #Deny from all

      Allow from all

   </Directory>

   KeepAliveTimeout 60

   MaxKeepAliveRequests 0

   ManagerBalancerName mycluster

   ServerAdvertise Off

</VirtualHost>

<Location /cluster-manager>

    SetHandler mod\_cluster-manager

    Order deny,allow

    Deny from all

    Allow from xx.xx.xx.xx

</Location>

ProxyStatus On

In the apache error log i have:

Sep  5 06:54:10 httpd[26073]: [debug] mod\_proxy\_cluster.c(622): update\_workers\_node starting

Sep  5 06:54:10 httpd[26073]: [debug] mod\_proxy\_cluster.c(637): update\_workers\_node done

Sep  5 06:54:22 httpd[25976]: [error] proxy: CLUSTER: (balancer://mycluster). All workers are in error state for route (NODE02)

For completeness, this is the mod\_proxy\_balancer configuration i tested:

<Proxy balancer://mycluster>

       BalancerMember ajp://node01:8001/ route=NODE01

       BalancerMember ajp://node02:8001/ route=NODE02

       BalancerMember ajp://node03:8001/ route=NODE03

       BalancerMember ajp://node04:8001/ route=NODE04

       ProxySet lbmethod=bybusyness

       ProxySet stickysession=JSESSIONID|jsessionid

</Proxy>

ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/

ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/

ProxyStatus On

Do you have any suggestion ? I tried to play with the timeouts but i was not able to find any working values.

As usual thanks in advance

Stef

  It looks like to me that the node is not sending the right address to httpd, to say it another way: 10.214.14.20 is not the address of node1 (or any of the nodes in the BalancerMember list). You have to provide the address either while starting the node whith -b node1 for example or adding address=node1 in the ajp connector.

  Hi Jean-Frederic,

  i already have the address in the ajp connector:

  |  | <Connector port="8001" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8441" address="10.214.14.209" maxThreads="200" /> |
  | --- | --- |

  and usually the system works fine.

  This is how the log continues if it can be useful (as you can see after some seconds apache is able to created worker to 10.214.14.209

  "But sometime there is a 503 (not always on the same host) with a timeout in the apache server log."

  That could be a problem of gc in the JVM too.

  Try to increase the ping and the nodeTimeout values or check the application behaviour.

  weird... do you have a little more trace? - before the "ajp\_marshal\_into\_msgb - No such method"

  It looks like you have a weird request being processed... Unfornatunatly it marks the node in error instead just reject the request.

  I was able to reproduce this last issue:

  1. open a shell

  2. type "telnet host post"

  3. type <SPACE><SPACE><SPACE><ENTER>

  that's all. The request is malformed and in the apache log there is:

  Sep  7 15:07:35 httpd[15164]: [error] ajp\_marshal\_into\_msgb - No such method

  Sep  7 15:07:35 httpd[15164]: [error] ajp\_send\_header: ajp\_marshal\_into\_msgb failed

  Sep  7 15:07:35 httpd[15164]: [error] (120010)APR does not understand this error code: proxy: AJP: request failed to 10.254.234.112:8001 (my-node04)

  Sep  7 15:07:39 httpd[15164]: [error] proxy: CLUSTER: (balancer://mycluster). All workers are in error state for route (NODE04)

  Sep  7 15:07:45 httpd[18651]: [debug] proxy\_util.c(1806): proxy: grabbed scoreboard slot 0 in child 18651 for worker proxy:reverse

  and some 503 are returned (i think 2 in this case since we had 2 workers).

  Im supposing this is bug, doesn't it ?

  The same scenario doesn't cause issues with mod\_proxy (just the request is rejected)

  (still testing 503 caused by timeout)

  Yes. In fact the bug is in mod\_proxy\_ajp the request should be rejected with not such method (bad request). I have patch httpd-trunk and proposed the patch for back port.

  But i have not undestood why with mod\_proxy\_balancer (and mod\_proxy\_apj since i'm using ajp as protocol) the issue doesn't occur.

  Thanks Jean-Frederic,

  one things i do not understand yet...

  Why mod\_cluster releases modules for apache ? I mean, i can use apache 2.2.21 but then i have to overwrite for instance mod\_proxy.so with the one coming from mod\_cluster...is this correct ? am I not loosing some fixes done in the apache code in this way ?

  I'm asking this since using official httpd modules without to overwrite them with the mod\_cluster ones (of course i copied the ones not available in apache) i have some issues (in particular it seems apache doesn't do stickysession).

  thanks

  mod\_cluster delivers bundles to make it more easy to test mod\_cluster.

  we deliver so files too in that case you will have to copy only:

  mod\_slotmem.so

  mod\_proxy\_cluster.so

  mod\_manager.so

  mod\_advertise.so

  Or wait for the next release of mod\_cluster

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2013

### Description

A Critical Patch Update (CPU) is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. Critical Patch Update patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes. Please refer to:

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapril2013verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](http://cve.mitre.org) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update July 2013 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1548709.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1548709.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, customers are recommended to upgrade to supported versions.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, Oracle Enterprise Manager Base Platform (formerly "Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control") and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](//www.oracle.com/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](//www.oracle.com/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

#### Notes:

1. Oracle released a [Java SE Critical Patch Update on June 18, 2013](/security-alerts/javacpujun2013.html) to address multiple vulnerabilities affecting the Java Runtime Environment.

## OS X Lion v10.7.3 and Security Update 2012-001

* **Address Book**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.2, OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.2

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position may intercept CardDAV data

  Description: Address Book supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for accessing CardDAV. A downgrade issue caused Address Book to attempt an unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection failed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:27:17 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the default error response for status code 400.  This could be used by an attacker to expose "httpOnly" cookies, when no custom ErrorDocument was specified.  This affects all versions of Apache from 2.2.0 up to and including 2.2.21.  It will be fixed upstream in 2.2.22 (via r1235454 [1]).  [1] <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1235454>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-01-27 06:33:29 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 785070](show_bug.cgi?id=785070 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2012-0053 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0021 CVE-2011-3607 httpd: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2012-01-28 06:13:41 UTC  ``` ====================================================== Name: [CVE-2012-0053](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-0053)  protocol.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.21 does not properly restrict header information during construction of Bad Request (aka 400) error documents, which allows remote attackers to obtain the values of HTTPOnly cookies via vectors involving a (1) long or (2) malformed header in conjunction with crafted web script.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-29 14:52:53 UTC  ``` Upstream fix (linked in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c0)) changes the amount of information sent back to an HTTP client when httpd detects one of the following problems:  1) HTTP request header line is longer than configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds the line (actually, a prefix of it read before reaching the limit) to its default 400 error page.  2) HTTP request header line is continuation of the previous line and both lines combined together exceed configured LimitRequestFieldSize limit.  In this case, httpd adds previous line to its default 400 error page.  Note: previous line here may refer to a concatenation of more than one line, if previous lines were continuations too.  3) HTTP request header line does not contain : , which is a separator between the header name and its value.  Case 1) is the one that can be used by malicious javascript to gain access to httpOnly cookies.  A script can set additional cookies to make Cookie: request header line length exceed LimitRequestFieldSize and read values of a httpOnly protected cookies from the httpd's error page.  This may allow a script injected via some XSS flaw to gain access to cookies it can not access directly.  Upstream fix ensures that error page only contains header name, or 80 character prefix of the header name, if the name exceeds that limit.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2012-02-01 08:20:33 UTC  ``` Write up of the issue for the original reporter:   <http://fd.the-wildcat.de/apache_e36a9cf46c.php>  It confirms the analysis above ([comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c4)).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:32 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=785069#c10)  Denis    2012-02-20 14:29:13 UTC  ``` Is httpd-2.2.3-53  impacted by the issue httpd-2.2.3-53 ?

Hi Blair,   We are working towards addressing of this issue in various versions of JBoss Enterprise Web Server too. But unfortunately as of right now we are unable to provide exact release date, when the updates can be expected (as the final date is subject of change depending on couple of internal conditions).  Hope the above being sufficient and helpful. Apologize, but can't provide more exact information.

It should also be noted that this is not an issue by itself.  This can only be exploited via some other cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw found in a web application running on the server and may allow injected JavaScript to gain access to HttpOnly cookies, if the application uses this protection for its cookies.   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0542)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1329 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
After installing the updated packages, users must restart the httpd
service for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-05-07
Updated:
2012-05-07
# RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache HTTP Server component for JBoss Enterprise Web
Server 1.0.2 that fixes multiple security issues and one bug is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1330 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server must be restarted for this update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-20 19:13:37 UTC  ``` RMDG partner and independent security consultancy, "Context Information  Security" has made CPNI Response aware of a security vulnerability which  could potentially allow an attacker to gain full internal access to a  network from the internet.  The technique exploits insecurely configured reverse web proxies to gain  access to internal/DMZ systems.  This attack is based on an Apache web server which is using "mod_rewrite"  to proxy web requests internally. Other proxies may suffer from this  issue.  The vulnerability occurs if the Apache configuration file is configured  like this:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) <http://internalserver:80$1> [P]  As opposed to:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) [http://internalserver:80/$1](http://internalserver:80/%241) [P]   It is important for readers to review their reverse proxy configurations  to ensure that the rewrite rules are securely configured and cannot be  abused in such a way that they can be used to compromise internal systems.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-26 11:54:29 UTC  ``` Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p>   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:10:49 UTC  ``` This flaw is now public, and has been fixed in svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  The full upstream advisory is as follows (noted because it contains mitigation information):  Apache HTTP Server Security Advisory ====================================  Title:       mod_proxy reverse proxy exposure  CVE:         [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) Date:        20111005 Product:     Apache HTTP Server Versions:    httpd 1.3 all versions, httpd 2.x all versions  Description: ============  An exposure was reported affecting the use of Apache HTTP Server in reverse proxy mode.  We would like to thank Context Information Security Ltd for reporting this issue to us.  When using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a reverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently expose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted requests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern match was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an unintended target URL.  For future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will validate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The documentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.  Details: ======== A configuration like one of the following examples:    RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ProxyPassMatch (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2>  could result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:    GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1  would get translated to a target of:    <http://images.example.com@other.example.com/something.png>  This will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname "other.example.com", as the "images.example.com@" segment would be treated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a remote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those expected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.  The request-URI string in this example, "@other.example.com/something.png", is not valid according to the HTTP specification, since it neither an absolute URI ("<http://example.com/path>") nor an absolute path ("/path").  For future releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests, instead returning a "400 Bad Request" error.  Actions: ========  Apache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine if they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying. Affected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:     <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>  For example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:    RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  to ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading "/".   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:12:39 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 743653](show_bug.cgi?id=743653 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2011-3368 httpd: reverse web proxy vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-06 09:21:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)) > Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that > is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases: >  >   <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p> >   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]  The example was changed to:   RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  via:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179283>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 15:05:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/reverseproxybypass/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-11 13:40:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:56:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1392 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1392.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:57:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1391 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1391.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c20)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-15 20:31:34 UTC  ``` The upstream fix for this issue is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  However that fix is insufficient as it does not handle HTTP 0.9 style requests (as noted via <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722545#c15>).

# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: mod\_dav crash ([CVE-2013-6438](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2013-6438))

XML parsing code in mod\_dav incorrectly calculates the end of the string when removing leading spaces and places a NUL character outside the buffer, causing random crashes. This XML parsing code is only used with DAV provider modules that support DeltaV, of which the only publicly released provider is mod\_dav\_svn.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Brett Gervasoni of Sense of Security for reporting and proposing a patch fix for this issue.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-20 19:13:37 UTC  ``` RMDG partner and independent security consultancy, "Context Information  Security" has made CPNI Response aware of a security vulnerability which  could potentially allow an attacker to gain full internal access to a  network from the internet.  The technique exploits insecurely configured reverse web proxies to gain  access to internal/DMZ systems.  This attack is based on an Apache web server which is using "mod_rewrite"  to proxy web requests internally. Other proxies may suffer from this  issue.  The vulnerability occurs if the Apache configuration file is configured  like this:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) <http://internalserver:80$1> [P]  As opposed to:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) [http://internalserver:80/$1](http://internalserver:80/%241) [P]   It is important for readers to review their reverse proxy configurations  to ensure that the rewrite rules are securely configured and cannot be  abused in such a way that they can be used to compromise internal systems.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-26 11:54:29 UTC  ``` Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p>   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:10:49 UTC  ``` This flaw is now public, and has been fixed in svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  The full upstream advisory is as follows (noted because it contains mitigation information):  Apache HTTP Server Security Advisory ====================================  Title:       mod_proxy reverse proxy exposure  CVE:         [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) Date:        20111005 Product:     Apache HTTP Server Versions:    httpd 1.3 all versions, httpd 2.x all versions  Description: ============  An exposure was reported affecting the use of Apache HTTP Server in reverse proxy mode.  We would like to thank Context Information Security Ltd for reporting this issue to us.  When using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a reverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently expose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted requests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern match was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an unintended target URL.  For future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will validate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The documentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.  Details: ======== A configuration like one of the following examples:    RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ProxyPassMatch (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2>  could result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:    GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1  would get translated to a target of:    <http://images.example.com@other.example.com/something.png>  This will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname "other.example.com", as the "images.example.com@" segment would be treated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a remote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those expected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.  The request-URI string in this example, "@other.example.com/something.png", is not valid according to the HTTP specification, since it neither an absolute URI ("<http://example.com/path>") nor an absolute path ("/path").  For future releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests, instead returning a "400 Bad Request" error.  Actions: ========  Apache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine if they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying. Affected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:     <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>  For example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:    RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  to ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading "/".   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:12:39 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 743653](show_bug.cgi?id=743653 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2011-3368 httpd: reverse web proxy vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-06 09:21:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)) > Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that > is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases: >  >   <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p> >   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]  The example was changed to:   RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  via:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179283>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 15:05:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/reverseproxybypass/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-11 13:40:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:56:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1392 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1392.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:57:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1391 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1391.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c20)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-15 20:31:34 UTC  ``` The upstream fix for this issue is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  However that fix is insufficient as it does not handle HTTP 0.9 style requests (as noted via <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722545#c15>).
