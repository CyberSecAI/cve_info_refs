{
  "CVE-2011-3348": {
    "Description": "mod_proxy_ajp did not correctly process certain malformed HTTP requests, which could cause it to incorrectly put a backend server to an error state until the retry timeout expired. A remote attacker could send malicious requests to trigger this issue, resulting in a temporary denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of malformed HTTP requests by mod_proxy_ajp.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect error handling leading to backend server being marked as failed",
      "Vulnerable to malformed requests"
    ],
    "Impact": "Temporary denial of service due to backend server being put into an error state.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote attacker sends malformed HTTP requests."
    ],
     "Required capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests."
  }
