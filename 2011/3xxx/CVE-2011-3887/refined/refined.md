Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how JavaScript URIs are handled within the browser, specifically related to cookie management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Cookie Theft:** The core issue is that a specially crafted JavaScript URI could be used to steal cookies. This implies an improper isolation or sanitization of the JavaScript URI's context when interacting with cookies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Cookie Theft:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to steal cookies from the victim's browser.
- This can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, data breaches, and impersonation, depending on the type of cookies stolen.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  **JavaScript URIs:** The attack is triggered by using malicious JavaScript URIs. This suggests the attacker would need to inject or get the victim to interact with such a URI, possibly through a link, an injected script, or similar methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to interact with a malicious JavaScript URI. This could be done via:
    - A malicious website
    - A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on a legitimate site
    - Phishing emails with malicious links
- The attacker does not need any specialized access to the user's machine besides a standard browser interaction.
