  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2011-3422": {
      "root_cause": "The certificate code trusted a root certificate to sign EV certificates if it was on the list of known EV issuers, even if the user had marked it as 'Never Trust' in Keychain. The root would not be trusted to sign non-EV certificates.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper certificate validation"
      ],
       "impact": "Some EV certificates may be trusted even if the corresponding root has been marked as untrusted",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Man-in-the-middle attacks could leverage a compromised root certificate to impersonate a trusted service."
     ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "An attacker must compromise an EV root certificate or a chain that leads to it that is trusted by the system, and also be in a privileged network position"
