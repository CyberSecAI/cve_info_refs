      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_b00d4b0e_20250125_170842.html",
      "root_cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for injection of malicious code. Additionally, it exposes the full path of the application through a template file.",

        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "Full Path Disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "XSS allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. Full path disclosure reveals the server's internal directory structure, which can aid in further attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the file description field, an attacker can execute XSS when the description is rendered.",
        "By directly accessing specific template files, an attacker can reveal the full path of the application."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to upload files and set file descriptions, or access the template files directly."
