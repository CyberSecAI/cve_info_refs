Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3659:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in the `nsDOMAttribute::doRemoveChild` function within Mozilla's browser engine. Specifically, when a child node is removed from an attribute, the `AttributeChildRemoved` notification is sent *before* the child node's reference is cleared. This allows mutation observers to access the removed child node after it has been logically removed, leading to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free. The code notifies observers of a child removal, and then releases the memory associated with the child. If an observer holds a reference to the removed child, accessing the node will result in a use-after-free.
- **Premature Notification:** The issue is triggered by the premature notification of `AttributeChildRemoved` before the child node's state is properly updated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** The use-after-free vulnerability can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is because the attacker can control the memory after the free and redirect the execution flow. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates this via heap spraying, which aims to control the memory that is accessed after the free.
- **Application Crash:** The vulnerability can also lead to application crashes due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Pages:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious web page that includes JavaScript code to trigger the use-after-free condition. The PoC attached to the bug report demonstrates this type of attack.
- **Browser Extensions:** It is also mentioned that Firefox extensions could be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to serve malicious web content:** An attacker needs to be able to deliver malicious HTML/JavaScript to a user through a web page or by some other means.
- **Understanding of DOM manipulation:** The attacker needs an understanding of how to manipulate the DOM to trigger the specific conditions of the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of heap spraying techniques:** The provided PoC demonstrates the use of heap spraying to manipulate memory after it is freed, allowing the attacker to cause an application crash or potentially achieve code execution.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability is described as a regression from a previous fix for a related issue (bug 590771).
- The fix involves reordering the operations in `nsDOMAttribute::doRemoveChild` to ensure that the child node's state is consistent before and after the notification of attribute removal.
- The vulnerability was present in Firefox versions 8, 9, 10, and 11, among others.
- The vulnerability is considered critical.
- The bug report provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) that triggers the vulnerability.
- The fix was implemented in Firefox 10 and 11 and backported to Firefox 3.6.26.

In summary, CVE-2011-3659 is a critical use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox related to DOM attribute node removal, that can be exploited for remote code execution through maliciously crafted web pages or browser extensions. The fix involves synchronizing notifications and memory management during attribute child removals.
