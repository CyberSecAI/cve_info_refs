Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3600:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the XML-RPC library's SAX parser not disabling external entity processing. This allows a malicious client to include server-side resources into the request by using external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is that the XML parser processes external entities, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Exposure:** By including external entities, a malicious client can potentially read server-side files or other resources that the server has access to.
*   The severity of the issue is considered low because for the information exposure to occur, the error message generated must be included in the application's response.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XML-RPC Request:** An attacker crafts a specially formed XML-RPC request containing external entity definitions that reference internal server resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send XML-RPC requests to a vulnerable server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves disabling external general and parameter entities in the `SAXParserFactory`.
*   The fix was introduced in XML-RPC version 3.1.3.
*   The issue was reported by Johan HÃ´gre.
*   The versions of `xmlrpc3` shipped with Fedora 13, 14 and 15 were not vulnerable since they did not use the vulnerable code by default, however Fedora 14 was affected because of a different configuration and this was tracked in a separate bug report ([bug 744364](show_bug.cgi?id=744364))

The Red Hat bug report indicates that this issue is not planned to be addressed in future updates.
