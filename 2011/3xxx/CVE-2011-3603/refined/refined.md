Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3603:

**Summary:**

The radvd daemon would not fail on `privsep_init()` errors, potentially causing it to run with full root privileges when it should be running as an unprivileged user.

**Root Cause:**

- The radvd daemon did not properly handle errors during the initialization of privilege separation (`privsep_init()`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Improper error handling in `privsep_init()`
- Failure to drop root privileges when privilege separation fails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The radvd daemon could continue to run with full root privileges even when it was configured to drop privileges, leading to potential security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered when `privsep_init()` fails, which might occur due to configuration or system issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker needs to be able to cause `privsep_init()` to fail to trigger the vulnerability. This could be achieved through manipulating the environment or system configuration. The attacker could potentially gain root access if privilege separation failed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information from the openwall mailing list message provides more context and detail than the initial CVE description, elaborating on the consequences of the error and the conditions that lead to the privilege escalation.
- The fix for this issue is included in radvd version 1.8.2.
