- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap overflow vulnerability exists due to the usage of a negative Content-Length field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap overflow, improper handling of Content-Length field.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request with a negative Content-Length to the server listening on port 808.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable software.
