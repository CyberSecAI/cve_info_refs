How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request: ruby on rails flaws (4)

Could we get CVEs assigned to these flaws?  Upstream had requested CVEs
prior to disclosure, but didn't receive any.

Hi,

maybe this issue would qualify for a CVE too(?):

  <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=673010>
  <http://webservsec.blogspot.com/2011/02/ruby-on-rails-vulnerability.html>

Thanks in advance.

There is a vulnerability in the content type handling in Ruby on Rails 2.3 which could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a response. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-YYYY-XXXX.

Versions Affected: 2.3.x.
Not affected: 3.0.0 or later
Fixed Versions: 2.3.13

Impact
------
The code in Ruby on Rails 2.3 which sets the response content type performs insufficient sanitization of the values provided. This means that applications which let the user provide an arbitrary Content-Type header for the response are vulnerable to response splitting attacks.

All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 2.3.13 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
There are no feasible workarounds for this issue.

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided patches for the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a single changeset.

\* 2-3-response\_splitting.patch - Patch for 2.3 series

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as soon as possible.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: Re: CVE request: ruby on rails flaws (4)

Sorry, there is one more flaw that needs a CVE assignment:

Response splitting flaw in 2.3.x (3.0.0 and later not affected).
<http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6ffc93bde0298768>
<https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/11dafeaa7533be26441a63618be93a03869c83a9>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=732156>

Sorry I missed this one earlier, I was looking at the 3.x advisory page and missed this one.

Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2930 CVE-2011-2931 CVE-2011-3186 CVE-2009-4214

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2009-4214

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).

CVE-2011-2930

    A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name
    method could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
    query.

CVE-2011-2931

    A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
    document.

CVE-2011-3186

    A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
    Content-Type header.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=732156#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-20 04:28:58 UTC  ``` A response splitting flaw in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x was reported [1] that could allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a response due to insufficient sanitization of the values provided for response content types.  This is corrected in upstream 2.3.13 (3.0.0 and later are not vulnerable).  Patches are available in the advisory [1] and git [2].  [1] <http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security/browse_thread/thread/6ffc93bde0298768> [2] <https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/11dafeaa7533be26441a63618be93a03869c83a9>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=732156#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-20 04:32:18 UTC  ``` Created rubygem-actionpack tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-14 [[bug 732158](show_bug.cgi?id=732158 "CLOSED ERRATA - rubygem-actionpack: response splitting flaw [fedora-14]")] Affects: epel-5 [[bug 677629](show_bug.cgi?id=677629 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0446 CVE-2011-0447 rubygem-actionpack various flaws [epel-5]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=732156#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 04:23:39 UTC  ``` This issue has been assigned the name CVE-2011-3186:  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/08/22/13>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=732156#c4)  Huzaifa S.
