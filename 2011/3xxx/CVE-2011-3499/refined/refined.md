- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A too-large size field in "EIDP" packets tunneled via the web service allows writing a 0x00 byte to an arbitrary memory location.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption due to uncontrolled write operation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary memory write, potentially leading to denial of service, code execution, or other unspecified impacts depending on what is overwritten and the environment.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted "EIDP" packet via an HTTP request to port 808. Exploitation via the native "EIDP" port 12233 does not appear to be possible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server on port 808.
