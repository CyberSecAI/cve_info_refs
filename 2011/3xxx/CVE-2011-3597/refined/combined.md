# USN-1643-1: Perl vulnerabilities

30 November 2012

Perl programs could be made to crash or run programs if they receive
specially crafted network traffic or other input.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 12.10](/security/notices?release=quantal)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)
* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [perl](/security/cves?package=perl) - Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language

## Details

It was discovered that the decode\_xs function in the Encode module is

vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted Unicode string.

An attacker could use this overflow to cause a denial of service.

([CVE-2011-2939](/security/CVE-2011-2939))

It was discovered that the 'new' constructor in the Digest module is

vulnerable to an eval injection. An attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3597](/security/CVE-2011-3597))

It was discovered that Perl's 'x' string repeat operator is vulnerable

to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-5195](/security/CVE-2012-5195))

Ryo Anazawa discovered that the CGI.pm module does not properly escape

newlines in Set-Cookie or P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences Project)

headers. An attacker could use this to inject arbitrary headers into

responses from applications that use CGI.pm. ([CVE-2012-5526](/security/CVE-2012-5526))

> I like the fact that they really dig into things and then provide answers. As the single Linux guy, I kind of need that second admin next to me sometimes to say, "Hey, what about this?" and I am able to do that through the portal. I get my questions answered and trouble tickets resolved.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=743010#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-03 15:13:18 UTC  ``` A flaw was reported [1] in perl Digest module's "Digest->new()" function, which did not properly sanitize input before using it in an eval() call, which could possibly be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary perl code.  The flaw is fixed in version 1.17 [2] and affects at least as far back as perl 5.8.5.  The following patch will correct the flaw (selectively taken from upstream's 1.16->1.17 differences):  --- Digest.pm.org       2011-10-03 09:10:29.019681252 -0600 +++ Digest.pm   2011-10-03 09:11:18.630250656 -0600 @@ -35,7 +35,9 @@ sub new         ($class, @args) = @$class if ref($class);         no strict 'refs';         unless (exists ${"$class\::"}{"VERSION"}) { -           eval "require $class"; +           my $pm_file = $class .

For additional information, refer to: <http://perldoc.perl.org/Digest.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=743010#c5)  Petr Pisar    2011-10-04 09:41:59 UTC  ``` The code in [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=743010#c3) assumes attacker can insert his own Digest::XXX module into Perl search path which itself is more serious problem.  Original test case in CPAN RT (<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71390#txn-983600>) does not need such privilege.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=743010#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-04 10:07:31 UTC  ``` This can be triggered when deserializing specially-crafted input using Data::Serializer.  Not sure if that actually makes any real difference.  In several serialization frameworks, it is assumed you should not deserialize any untrusted input, as that can lead to code execution.  Data::Serializer documentation does not seem to mention that in any way.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=743010#c7)  Petr Pisar    2011-10-04 13:11:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 526246](attachment.cgi?id=526246&action=diff "Fix for Perl 5.14.2") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=526246&action=edit "Fix for Perl 5.14.2") Fix for Perl 5.14.2   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=743010#c8)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-24 23:03:24 UTC  ``` perl-5.12.4-162.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.
