### Summary of CVE-2011-3597

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The 'new' constructor in the Perl Digest module is vulnerable to an eval injection due to improper sanitization of input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input sanitization before using it in an `eval()` call.
- Code injection vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary Perl code.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious algorithm name to be used by the constructor.
- Through deserialization of specially crafted input using `Data::Serializer`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to influence the algorithm name used in the `Digest->new()` constructor.
- In the case of `Data::Serializer`, ability to provide malicious serialized data.
- Ability to execute Perl code or set the algorithm name used by the constructor.
