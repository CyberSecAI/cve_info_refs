**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The email discusses a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! 1.6.1. It is noted that many PHP CMS applications have similar path disclosure issues. The specific nature of the flaw is not described in detail, but it is a server-side issue that allows the disclosure of the server's file paths.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Path Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially gain information about the server's file system structure by observing revealed file paths.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:**  The primary impact is the disclosure of sensitive information about the server's directory structure. This information can be leveraged to further attacks by understanding where configuration files or other sensitive data might be stored

**Attack vectors:**

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable Joomla application. No specific user role is mentioned and this is likely an unauthenticated vulnerability.

**Additional notes**
