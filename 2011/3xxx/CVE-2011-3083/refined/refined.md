Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-3083:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is a browser crash that occurs when handling video content in conjunction with FTP (File Transfer Protocol). The root cause is a missing FTP job factory in the media context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Missing FTP job factory:** The media context lacked the necessary component for handling FTP requests when playing video. This oversight caused a crash when a video attempts to utilize FTP, indicating a flaw in how media resources are handled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Browser crash:** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a browser crash. While this might not directly result in data breaches or arbitrary code execution, it leads to a denial of service by forcing the browser to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Website with video and FTP usage:** An attacker could create a malicious website or inject malicious code into a legitimate website. This site would attempt to play a video that relies on FTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to serve web content:** The attacker needs the ability to host a webpage or inject code into an existing webpage. They must also be able to cause a video resource to be requested using FTP.
-   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit the crafted webpage.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability was classified as "Low" severity, suggesting that while disruptive, it doesn't pose a critical security risk like remote code execution.
-   The fix implemented was to provide the media context with an FTP job factory, which ensures proper handling of FTP requests related to video playback and prevents the browser from crashing.
-   The fix was committed in revision 121378.
