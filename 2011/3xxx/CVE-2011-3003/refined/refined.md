  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2011-3003",
      "description": "Ben Hawkes of the Google Security Team reported a WebGL test case that demonstrated an out of bounds write after an allocation failed.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is that when memory allocation for a WebGL buffer fails during `BufferSubData_array`, the code doesn't properly check for the allocation failure before proceeding with memory operations. Specifically, when `mData` allocation fails, `mByteLength` isn't set to `0` to indicate a failed allocation. This leads to a use-after-free condition.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper error handling for memory allocation failure.",
        "Use of uninitialized or invalid memory pointers.",
        "Out-of-bounds write due to missing allocation failure check."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a crash by triggering an out-of-bounds write, which results in a segmentation fault.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious website utilizing WebGL can trigger the vulnerability by crafting specific buffer operations that cause a memory allocation failure.",
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to control WebGL calls within a webpage, which can be achieved by crafting a malicious webpage."
