- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ameos_dragndropupload` TYPO3 extension fails to properly authenticate users, allowing unauthenticated file uploads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper authentication leading to arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the uploaded files are executable and accessible by the webserver.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, where an unauthenticated user sends a malicious upload request to the vulnerable extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special capabilities or be in a specific position. They can be unauthenticated and still exploit the vulnerability.
