Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3593:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to incorrect backporting of upstream patches in the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Specifically, the issue arises when the kernel handles VLAN frames that contain only priority tags (VID=0).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `vlan_hwaccel_do_receive` function in the kernel's VLAN implementation did not correctly handle frames with priority tags only, leading to a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can lead to a kernel panic. This would result in a denial of service, causing the affected system to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted network frames with priority tags and a VID of 0 to a vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the target system. This could be achieved from a local network or, potentially, if the system is exposed to the internet. No specific authentication or privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability on the target system, meaning an unprivileged network attacker could cause a denial of service if they could send the malicious network packets.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is specific to the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and does not affect the upstream kernel or other RHEL versions.
- The fix involves checking if `skb->dev` is a valid VLAN interface before processing the packet, and if not, the packet is dropped.
- The fix sets `skb->pkt_type = PACKET_OTHERHOST` to ensure the frame is dropped quickly, preventing the kernel panic.
- The provided information details the crash and includes the stack trace related to the panic, which is caused by null pointer dereference at `vlan_hwaccel_do_receive`.
