Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3347:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `be2net` driver within the Linux kernel when an interface is placed in promiscuous mode and receives VLAN packets for which no VLANs are configured on that interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The `be2net` driver fails to properly handle VLAN packets when in promiscuous mode and no VLANs are configured, leading to a kernel crash.
- This indicates a lack of proper input validation or error handling in the driver's code when dealing with VLAN tagged packets in promiscuous mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a kernel crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The system becomes unresponsive and requires a reboot to recover.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending VLAN tagged packets to a network interface that is in promiscuous mode, where no VLANs are configured on the interface.
- The attacker must have the capability to send network packets to the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system to send the crafted VLAN packets.
- The attacker does not need to have root privileges on the target system to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker only needs the ability to send packets.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in the `8021q` module, which is part of the Linux kernel's networking stack.
- Red Hat has provided patches for this vulnerability in various Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions (5, 6, 6.1) and RHEV-H via RHSA advisories.
- The issue affects interfaces using the be2net driver.

In summary, CVE-2011-3347 is a kernel-level vulnerability that can be triggered remotely, causing a denial-of-service by sending crafted network packets.
