{
  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2011-3012",
      "root_cause": "The ioQuake3 engine does not check for dangerous file extensions before writing to the quake3 directory.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate file extension validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious third-party addon that creates a Trojan horse DLL file.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can trick a user into connecting to a malicious server or by performing a man-in-the-middle attack.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a game server or have the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack."
    },
   {
      "cve": "CVE-2011-1412",
      "root_cause": "A shell injection vulnerability exists in ioQuake3 client when connecting to a malicious server.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of server-supplied configuration variables leading to shell command injection."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious server can force the execution of arbitrary shell commands on the client's system.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious server can inject commands when a vulnerable client connects to it.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a game server."
    },
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2011-2764",
       "root_cause": "The Quake3 engine can load DLL files during gameplay which can lead to code execution outside of the VM context. A file extension check introduced in revision r1499 was broken, allowing malicious game code to write DLL files that can be loaded by the engine.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper file extension validation",
         "Ability to load and execute arbitrary DLLs"
      ],
      "impact": "Malicious game code can execute arbitrary code outside of the Quake3 virtual machine context. This can lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious addon can write a DLL file that is later loaded by the engine.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious game addon."
