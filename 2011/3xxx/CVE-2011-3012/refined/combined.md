Hello,
Quake 3 is a popular online first person shooter developed by IDsoftware [1]
that has been released in 1999 and is still widely played.
After the release of the source code under the GPL, the ioQuake3 project [2]
was started that is dedicated to maintaining the existing codebase.
Several game projects are using a modified version of the ioQuake3 engine.
Some of these projects are:
- World of Padman [3]
- Smokin' Guns [4]
- OpenArena [5]
- Tremulous [6]
========================================
Issue #1:
Remote shell injection vulnerability on connecting clients
========================================
This bug has been discovered by /dev/humancontroller. Parts of the
description here are also by him.
\* details
If an ioQuake3 client for UNIX-like systems connects to a malicious id Tech
3 (Point Release 1.32 compatible) server, the server can force execution of
arbitrary shell commands on the client's system.
\* CVE
CVE-2011-1412 has been assigned for this issue.
\* severity
high
\* affected OS
All UNIXoid systems, except MacOSX:
- Linux
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- [...]
Not affected:
- Windows
- MacOSX
\* games affected
- IoQuake3 after revision 1773 and before 2097
- World of Padman 1.5.1
- OpenArena packaged by some Linux distributors
Other game engines based on the ioQuake3 codebase, that have merged ioQuake3
revision 1773, but not 2097, are also vulnerable.
\* workaround
No workaround.
\* proof of concept
Launch an ioQuake3 game server. Set the fs\_game cvar to "`echo
TROLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLO
> trollme.txt`". Connect to the server with a recent ioQuake3 client for
UNIX-like systems. The client should (after failing to create a directory
with an overly long name) execute a shell command to write a file.
\* patches
Several distributors have already been contacted and have prepared patches
for their distributions.
A sourcecode patch can be got here:
http://thilo.tjps.eu/download/patches/ioq3-svn-r2097.diff
========================================
Issue #2:
Malicious gamecode can Execute arbitrary code outside of
Q3 Virtual Machine context
========================================
This bug has been discovered by /dev/humancontroller.
\* details
The Quake3 engine uses game-specific code that is provided in a platform
independent bytecode format. This code has restricted access to
functionality provided by the engine. It should not be allowed access to
data outside the VM context.
Over the course of gameplay, the quake3 engine may dynamically load DLL
files in certain configurations. For instance, if vm\_ui is set to "0" quake3
tries to open a DLL file to load the game logic behind the user interface.
Part of the functionality offered to VM logic is the possibility to write to
files within the quake3 directory. By writing a malicious DLL file, a
program residing in the VM could trigger the execution of code outside the VM
context.
To prevent this from happening, ioquake3 introduced a file extension check
in r1499 which denied writing files with certain names. However, this check
was broken and corrected in r2098 only.
This security issue has been around for a long time even in the original
quake3 engine and is not limited to ioquake3.
It affects a wide range of commercial games as well. It is only exploitable
if a user installs 3rd party addons from untrusted sources.
Quake3 was never really designed to be secure against malicious 3rd party
content, and probably isn't even in latest revisions of ioquake3. So
downloading of untrusted content is still discouraged.
\* CVE
CVE-2011-2764 has been assigned for this issue.
\* severity
medium
\* affected OS
All OS with dynamic linker
\* games affected
All games using the quake3 engine
\* workaround
Don't download and install untrusted addons. Set cl\_allowdownload to 0
\* patches
Several distributors have already been contacted and have prepared patches
for their distributions.
A sourcecode patch can be got here:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c0)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-27 07:12:24 UTC  ``` Two security vulnerabilities in the ioquake3 engine may affect your quake3 and/or openarena packages. I will comment with more details when I have confirmed that this bug is not public.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c1)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-27 07:16:48 UTC  ``` Passing on a message from upstream developer Thilo Schulz <thilo>, who should be contacted for further details if required:  Dear Sir or Madam,  I am informing you about two security vulnerabilities that were recently found by a user with the handle "devhc" in ioquake3, an open source project dedicated to the maintenance of the dated quake3 engine, see <http://www.ioquake3.org> for more information. It is my understanding, that your distributions or games are packaging or based on recent revisions of ioquake3.  The first bug was introduced in svn revision 1773 and does not exist in ioquake3's last official release (version 1.36), however, several projects that are based on more recent svn revisions of our source tree might be afflicted, like "World of Padman". The first bug is a shell injection vulnerability which allows server admins to execute arbitrary shell commands on connecting clients. It can be triggered by setting the fs_game cvar to something like "`echo <insert 250 chars here> > inject.txt`" This bug was fixed in revision 2097, see : <http://svn.icculus.org/quake3?view=rev&revision=2097>  [[CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412) has been assigned to the vulnerability fixed in r2097 -smcv]  The second bug is not as severe, but was already introduced in revision 1499, thus ioquake3 1.36 is afflicted. Here, a file extension check is broken and malicious game code might execute arbitrary code outside its Virtual Machine context by writing to DLL files that are loaded by the quake3 engine during gameplay. This bug was fixed in revision 2098, see: <http://svn.icculus.org/quake3?view=rev&revision=2098>  [[CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) has been assigned to the vulnerability fixed in r2098 -smcv]  We intend to go public with this information around Thursday noon (European time), so please do not disclose these details until our official posting to bugtraq or Full Disclosure.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c2)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-27 07:20:27 UTC  ``` These are bugs in the ioquake3 engine, not in particular game code. I don't know how you handle this engine in Fedora; the upstreams of various games each have their own outdated "official" ioquake3 builds, but in Debian we use a shared engine binary for OpenArena and Quake III Arena.  I believe that who is and isn't vulnerable goes like this:                             engine | based on | [CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412) | [CVE-2011-2674](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2674) | ----------------------------------+----------+-------+-------+---------------+ ioQuake3 1.36                     | r1520    | -             | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-13 (0.8.5) | r1759    | -             | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-14 (0.8.5) | r1759    | -             | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-15         | r1783    | vulnerable    | vulnerable    | OpenArena engine 0.8.x-16         | r1788    | vulnerable    | vulnerable    | ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20 server   | r1240    | -             | no check      | ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20 client   | r1142    | -             | no check      | World of Padman 1.2 non-Windows   | r1202    | -             | no check      | World of Padman 1.2 Windows-only  | r1142    | -             | no check      | World of Padman first standalone  | r1051    | -             | no check      | Tremulous 1.1.0                   | ?        | -             | no check      | ----------------------------------+----------+-------+-------+---------------+  Engines marked "no check" for [CVE-2011-2674](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2674) don't have the regression from r1499, but also don't have the check as originally added (r1405) at all, so the only way to use them safely is to turn off auto-downloading, or not allow native-code gamecode (or preferably, both). Engines this old probably aren't safe to use on untrusted bytecode anyway, though.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c3)  Rahul Sundaram    2011-07-27 07:46:09 UTC  ``` Hans,  can you help with this?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c4)  Hans de Goede    2011-07-27 09:01:52 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c3)) > Hans,  can you help with this?  Yes :)  Fedora is shipping ioquake3 svn r1802 in all supported releases + some patches to allow using a single ioquake3 binary with all of quake3 / openarena / UrbanTerror / World of Padman (these patches come from Debian and have been submitted upstream).  This means that what we are vulnerable to both CVE-s. I'll prepare an update for this tonight (on my local system), and commit, build, and create an update in bodhi for this as soon as this goes public.  Simon,  Can you let me know the instant this goes public? Or shall I just commit the package changes to our git (thus making them public) and start the builds tomorrow (Thursday) after 11am CET ?

Yes and no, openarena uses the quake3 package for the ioquake3 engine, but tremulous / tremfusion and alienarena use and ship with a fork of the ioquake3 engine.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c11)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-28 09:53:29 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c10)) > tremulous / tremfusion and alienarena use and ship with a fork of the ioquake3 > engine  The version of Tremulous in Debian (1.1.0) is based on ioquake3, but is too old to suffer from [CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412) (the more serious and easily-exploitable of these vulnerabilities). If your version is different, the pattern to grep for is 'system *('.   I believe Alien Arena is based on Quake *2*, possibly with some code from ioquake3 added. In any case, the version in Debian (7.51) doesn't seem to have [CVE-2011-1412](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-1412).  Upstream consider [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) to be a less serious vulnerability. It's only significant if you allow your Q3 engine to run untrusted bytecode (either by enabling auto-downloading, or by installing untrusted mods in your home directory) *and* you allow it to run native-code DLLs (+set vm_cgame 0, +set vm_game 0, +set vm_ui 0, or Debian's patch to let bytecode be replaced by a request to load the equivalent native code so we don't rely on pre-built bytecode that we can't rebuild - I don't think you apply that particular patch in Fedora?).  In Debian's OpenArena, I'm treating -2764 as a vulnerability, due to that patch; but if you're using the unmodified bytecode in pak*.pk3, it's not exploitable under a normal configuration.  Older ioQuake3 forks like Tremulous are probably not safe to use with untrusted bytecode in any case (there have been crash bugs, although as far as I know, none are thought to be exploitable beyond DoS) so auto-downloading isn't a good idea anyway. I believe it's off by default, but can be enabled through the GUI.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c12)  Simon McVittie    2011-07-28 13:37:56 UTC  ``` Now public, <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-July/082070.html>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c13)  Hans de Goede    2011-07-28 14:23:20 UTC  ``` Hi,  (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c12)) > Now public, > <http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2011-July/082070.html>  Thanks for this, as well as for all your other work on this and your input wrt the (non)vulnerability of alienarena and tremulous.

This should only impact configurations where execution of native compiled (rather then the standard quake3 byte code format) game logic is allowed. We don't ship any such configurations.  Simon, can you confirm my analysis?   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c19)  Simon McVittie    2011-08-10 09:01:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c17)) > The ioQuake3 engine, as used in World of Padman 1.2 and earlier, > Tremulous 1.1.0, and ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20, does not check for > dangerous file extensions before writing to the quake3 directory, > which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted > third-party addon that creates a Trojan horse DLL file, a different > vulnerability than [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764).  How does this differ from [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764), except by claiming to be different? This is exactly how you'd exploit -2764, and all of the references in [Comment #17](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c17) discuss -1412 and -2764. The upstream advisory from Thilo Schulz, posted to Full Disclosure and SecurityFocus, specifically states that -2764 was allocated for what Thilo calls "Issue #2" (the one fixed in r2098).  (I can't currently reach securityfocus.com for some reason, but it seems liveweb.archive.org can... meanwhile, cve.mitre.org just gives me an error, but that seems to be normal for recent vulnerabilities.)  I obtained the two CVE IDs -1412 and -2764 from the Debian security team while helping Thilo to coordinate this advisory.  If there is a separate vulnerability not fixed in r2098, please contact me and Thilo privately.  (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c18)) > This should only impact configurations where execution of native compiled > (rather then the standard quake3 byte code format) game logic is allowed.  This is true for [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764), at least: Fedora should only be vulnerable if a user sets one of the vm_ui, vm_game or vm_cgame cvars to "0". (OpenArena in Debian was vulnerable, because we avoid using the bytecode for licensing reasons.)  I haven't seen any description of [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) that explains how it differs from -2764, so I can't say anything about -3012.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-10 09:21:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #19](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c19)) > (I can't currently reach securityfocus.com for some reason, but it seems > liveweb.archive.org can... meanwhile, cve.mitre.org just gives me an error, > but that seems to be normal for recent vulnerabilities.)  Yes, it does take some time.  Even when Mitre creates descriptions, they appear on cve.mitre only after some delay.  Nist's NVD site has them earlier:  <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-2764> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2011-3012>  > I haven't seen any description of [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) that explains how it differs > from -2764, so I can't say anything about -3012.  Looking at the full-disclosure post, and given the experience with how CVEs are split some times, this is most likely related to:    To prevent this from happening, ioquake3 introduced a file extension check   in r1499 which denied writing files with certain names. However, this check   was broken and corrected in r2098 only.  [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) seems to be for "ioquake3 does not check file extensions before writing file, r1499" and [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) for "previous fix for [CVE-2011-3012](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3012) was incomplete and did not correctly prevent creating files with arbitrary extension, r2098".  HTH   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c21)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-22 18:21:29 UTC  ``` According to this Debian bug report, tremulous is also affected by these flaws:  <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=660827>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c22)  Jan Kaluža    2012-02-23 08:35:58 UTC  ``` Note that we're using Tremulous 1.2beta because 1.1 has problems running on x86_64 architecture and upstream doesn't want to fix it in version 1.1. There are no functions mentioned in second and third attached patch. I will fix just "DLL overwriting" issue from the first patch + other CVEs.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c23)  Simon McVittie    2012-02-23 08:59:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c22)) > Note that we're using Tremulous 1.2beta because 1.1 has problems running on > x86_64 architecture and upstream doesn't want to fix it in version 1.1.  (I worked around that in Debian by patching out the (broken?) x86-64 JIT and using the generic interpreter used by unsupported architectures, which seems to be OK.)  If by "1.2beta" you mean GPP1 ("gameplay preview 1"), I believe it's only vulnerable to [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) (see <<http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2012/Feb/118>>), but please do double-check that.  [CVE-2011-2764](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2764) has the mitigation that it's only a threat if you run untrusted bytecode, and if you run untrusted bytecode, you have worse problems:  (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=725951#c11)) > Older ioQuake3 forks like Tremulous are probably not safe to use with untrusted > bytecode in any case (there have been crash bugs, although as far as I know, > none are thought to be exploitable beyond DoS) so auto-downloading isn't a good > idea anyway. I believe it's off by default, but can be enabled through the GUI.  In Debian's Tremulous I've patched out auto-downloading altogether. I'm tempted to do the same in our ioquake3 packages.   ``` |  |
