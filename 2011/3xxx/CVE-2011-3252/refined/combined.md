## OS X Lion v10.7.3 and Security Update 2012-001

* **Address Book**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.2, OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.2

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position may intercept CardDAV data

  Description: Address Book supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for accessing CardDAV. A downgrade issue caused Address Book to attempt an unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection failed. An attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this behavior to intercept CardDAV data. This issue is addressed by not downgrading to an unencrypted connection without user approval.
