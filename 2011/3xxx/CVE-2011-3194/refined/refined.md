Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-3194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is improper handling of greyscale TIFF images with multiple samples per pixel within the Qt library. Specifically, the TIFF reader uses `QImage::Format_Indexed8` incorrectly when it should use `QImage::Format_Indexed16`, leading to memory corruption when processing such images.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow when processing specially crafted greyscale TIFF images with multiple samples per pixel.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (application crash).
- Potential for arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the affected application.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user is tricked into opening a specially crafted greyscale TIFF image file with an application that uses the vulnerable Qt library. This can occur through various channels like email, web browsers, or any other program that processes images using Qt.
- The attacker needs to craft a specific greyscale TIFF image file with multiple samples per pixel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious greyscale TIFF image.
- The attacker does not require any authentication, but they need to trick a user into opening the malicious file.

**Additional Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in the `qtiffhandler.cpp` file within the Qt library, and arises from the incorrect use of QImage::Format_Indexed8 instead of QImage::Format_Indexed16 when dealing with the `TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL` value for greyscale images, as described in the upstream commit message.
- The affected versions of Qt are prior to 4.7.4-r1 (Gentoo) and 4.6.2-17.el6_1.1 (Red Hat). The patch is to fix the tiff reader to correctly handle the `TIFFTAG_SAMPLESPERPIXEL` for grayscale images
