Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-3266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A malformed IKE packet can cause excessive resource consumption within Wireshark's IKE dissector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in how the IKE dissector in Wireshark handles malformed packets. It doesn't properly validate or sanitize the input, leading to excessive resource use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause Wireshark to crash by injecting a malformed IKE packet.
- This can be achieved either by injecting the malformed packet onto a network being monitored or by tricking someone into opening a malicious packet capture file.
- This can lead to denial-of-service for users of Wireshark.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network injection of a malformed IKE packet.
- Delivering a malformed packet trace file to a Wireshark user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to inject network traffic or have the capability to send a user a malicious capture file.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided information indicates that Wireshark versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.1 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.8 are affected, and the fix is available in versions 1.6.2 and 1.4.9 or later.
- The fix involved upgrading Wireshark to version 1.4.10 in the SUSE and openSUSE distributions.
