PSN #  PSN003314u
Original publication date: 16-May-11. This is Issue #05, published date:
31-Mar-14.

Severity/risk level  High

Urgency

Immediately

Name of problem  SAL Gateway default IP, Proxy Server Host name, Policy Server Host name, Secondary Core Server Host

Name and Secondary Remote Server Host Name points to invalid servers which are not owned by Avaya. This
can pose a security threat and suspicious activity can be logged in customer firewall logs.

Products affected
Secure Access Link (SAL): Releases, 1.5, 1.8, and 2.0
System Platform: Releases 1.1 (contains Secure Access Link (SAL) 1.5) and 6.0.X  (contains Secure Access Link (SAL) 1.8)
Problem description
On a non-interactive installation of SAL Gateway the default properties are provided with the installer. This installer provided defaults
for the SAL Gateway IP address, the Proxy Server Host Name, a Policy Server Host Name, the Secondary Core Server Hostname and
a Secondary Remote Server Host Name addresses which are invalid public domain servers and NOT owned by Avaya.  The defaults
point to 123.124.123.234, customerproxy.com, custpolicyserver.com, secavaya.com and secaxeda.com respectively. These servers
resolve to invalid domains and pose a security threat in that they were not intended to be used, but may be used if the SAL GW is not
properly configured.

Customers may report observed suspicious usage of the default addresses if the SAL GW is enabled but not properly configured.
Some behaviors that may be seen include traffic to the wrong servers due to the default values: 1) SSH used to the default
123.124.123.234 SAL GW as part of a SAL GW collector process that may run periodically to test for the SAL GW management port.
2) HTTP traffic to an unconfigured default server address or 3) HTTPS traffic to a default server address.

The intended configuration is that the SAL Gateway IP address should be configured to the actual gateway machine IP address. The
Proxy server host name should be configured to the actual customer proxy server host name (if required). The Policy server host name
should be configured to the actual Avaya policy server host name (if required). The Secondary Core Server Hostname should be
configured to the same address as the Primary Core Server Hostname. And the Secondary Remote Server Host Name should be
configured to the same address as the Primary Remote Server Host Name.

Resolution
To avoid the security issues, please perform the following steps. These steps are applicable to standalone SAL gateway as well as for
SAL gateway that are on System Platform.

In case of a SAL gateway that is on System Platform and not intended to be used then there is a provision in System Platform 6.0.X to
disable the SAL Gateway. However same option is not available in System Platform 1.1 release.  If the SAL Gateway is disabled on
System platform 6.0.X, then following steps are not technically required but recommended to be applied before disablement.

NOTE: Typographic errors can also yield improper or suspicious activity when not properly configured. For example, avay.com is
NOT a valid Avaya domain and not owned by Avaya, and there may be others.  Please check values entered carefully for accuracy.

Please follow the below steps for proper configuration:

1.  Login to the SAL Gateway UI with the user having either Security Administrator or Administrator role.
2.  Navigate to the Administration section of the SAL Gateway menu, click on “Gateway Configuration”
3.
4.  Navigate to the Administration section of the SAL Gateway menu, click on “Proxy” (Only for ver. 1.8, 2.0)
5.

In the ‘Gateway IP Address’ field, enter the actual SAL Gateway machine IP.

If proxy server is not needed then uncheck ‘Use Proxy’ checkbox and click on ‘Apply’. If it is needed then change ‘Host’ and ‘Port’
settings with actual values and click on ‘Apply’.

6.  Navigate to the Administration section of the SAL Gateway menu, click on “Policy Server” (Only for ver. 1.8, 2.0)
7.

If policy server is not needed then uncheck ‘Use a Policy Server’ and click on ‘Apply’. If it is needed then change ‘Server’ and ‘Port’
settings with actual values and click on ‘Apply’.

8.  Navigate to the Administration section of the SAL Gateway menu, click on “SAL Enterprise” (ver. 1.5, 1.8) / “Core Server” (ver. 2.0).
9.
In the “Secondary Enterprise” (ver. 1.5, 1.8) / “Secondary Core Server” (ver. 2.0) field, enter the host name same as the “Primary
Enterprise” (ver. 1.5, 1.8) / “Primary Core Server” (ver. 2.0) hostname.

10.  In the Port field for Secondary server, enter the port number same as that for the Primary one.
11.  Click on Apply.
12.  Navigate to the Administration section of the SAL Gateway menu; click “Remote Access” (ver. 1.5, 1.8) / “Remote Server” (ver. 2.0).

13.  In the “Secondary Server Host Name / IP Address” (ver. 1.5, 1.8) / “Secondary Remote Server” (ver. 2.0) field, enter the hostname same as

the “Primary Server Host Name / IP Address” (ver. 1.5, 1.8) / “Primary Remote Server” (ver. 2.0).

14.  In the Port field for Secondary server, enter the port number same as that for the Primary one.
15.  Click on Apply.
16.  Navigate to the Administration section of the SAL Gateway menu, click on “Apply Configuration Changes”
17.  Click on ‘Apply’. It will restart SAL gateway services to affect the changes.
18.  Logout from the Gateway UI.

NOTE: Only disable the SAL GW in System Platform 6.0.X if you are sure it is not being used.

To disable an UNUSED SAL GW in System Platform 6.0.X follow these steps:

Login to System Platform cdom webconsole.
In the navigation pane, click Server Management > SAL Gateway Management.



  On the SAL Gateway Management page, click Disable SAL Gateway.

In System Platform 1.1, the service for SAL GW could be stopped but it would restart after a reboot or power cycle.
Therefore, for System Platform 1.1, it is critical that the steps above to reconfigure the defaults have been applied.

Workaround or alternative remediation
  SAL GW releases starting with 2.1 have removed the defaults and may be installed as a standalone SAL GW installation.
