The provided content describes a vulnerability in Avaya Secure Access Link (SAL) Gateway versions 1.5, 1.8, and 2.0. This vulnerability is related to the default configuration of the software after installation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the default configuration of the SAL Gateway software. The Secondary Core Server URL and the Remote Server URL, by default, point to `secavaya.com` and `secaxeda.com` respectively which are invalid public domain servers not owned by Avaya. Additionally, the default IP address, proxy server host name, and policy server host name are also set to invalid public domain servers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The SAL gateway may send information, such as alarms and logs, to the invalid server domains, `secavaya.com` and `secaxeda.com`.
- **Insecure Defaults:** The software ships with preconfigured default server addresses that are not under Avaya's control, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive information from the SAL gateway can be disclosed to unauthorized parties. This includes alarms and logs.
- Customers may observe suspicious network traffic destined for the default invalid addresses.
- Potential for other security threats due to improper configuration and traffic being sent to unintended destinations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Unconfigured SAL Gateways that use the default settings will automatically send information to the invalid domains.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker capabilities are required. The vulnerability is present by default.
- The attacker does not need to be in any special position. The vulnerability is based on the software configuration.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by Avaya in their Product Support Notice PSN003314u.
- The solution is to reconfigure the SAL Gateway to use the correct server addresses.
- The vulnerability was present in SAL Gateway versions 1.5, 1.8, and 2.0, which are also included in System Platform 1.1 and 6.0.x
- It appears that no CVE was assigned.
