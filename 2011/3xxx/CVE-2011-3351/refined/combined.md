| [Description](#c0)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-10-02 03:37:25 UTC  ``` From the Secunia advisory at URL:  A security issue has been reported in OpenVAS Scanner, which can be exploited by malicious, local users to perform certain actions with escalated privileges.  The security issue is caused due to the application passing a predictable temporary filename to the "-r" parameter of the ovaldi application, which can be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files via symlink attacks.  The security issue is reported in version 3.2.4. Other versions may also be affected. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2013-07-01 10:37:26 UTC  ``` Should be fixed with updated openvas-versions now in tree.  According to this this has almost no severity: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/09/09/10>  So going ahead with no GLSA? ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2013-11-10 18:42:17 UTC  ``` security, can we close this one? openvas is ~-only, so no glsa needed anyway. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Chris Reffett (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2013-11-10 18:59:01 UTC  ``` If all affected versions are gone, then yes, noglsa. ``` |  |

I was aware of this issue, thanks. Just yesterday the upstream
developers fixed this bug as well as other temporary race conditions
in the code. This bug seems to happen only if running both
openvas-scanner as well as 'ovaldi' are installed and only under some
conditions (see below). This is because when openvas-server is
configured to use the OVAL tool it will store the results in a
temporary file. The main culprit is in openvasd/oval_plugins.c:

    562   sc_filename = g_strconcat (folder, "sc-out.xml", NULL);
    563   log_write ("SC Filename: %s\n", sc_filename);
    564   results_filename = "/tmp/results.xml";
    565
    566   if (g_file_test (results_filename, G_FILE_TEST_EXISTS))
    567     {
    568       log_write ("Found existing results file in %s, deleting it to avoi
    568 d conflicts.", results_filename);
    569       g_unlink (results_filename);
    570     }
    571
    572   sc_file = fopen (sc_filename, "w");
    573   if (sc_file == NULL)

Although some other race conditions have been found there.

However:

- this code gets only executed if an OVAL plugin has been added to the
Openvas-server
- neither  openvas-plugins-dfsg (which provides some plugins) nor
upstream (in the downloadable plugin feeds) provide any OVAL plugin
- in order for this code to work the 'ovaldi' program needs to be
installed in the same server

Consequently, the bug is not exploitable in a default installation of
openvas-server in Debian, it is only exploitable if the sysadmin has:

- installed 'ovaldi'
- configured the openvas-server to run 'unsigned' plugins
- written his own OVAL plugins and added them to the server to be executed

In any case, this has been fixed in OpenVAS' SVN, see
<http://lists.wald.intevation.org/pipermail/openvas-devel/2011-September/002725.html>

I will review the fix and apply (or backport it) to the openvas-server
(2.x series in unstable) and the openvas-scanner (3.x series in
experimental).

Moritz, do you believe this bug merits a DSA? Please let me know, I
can also provide compiled packages for Wheezy if needed be.

Regards

Javier

Thanks for your verbose analysis.

No, this doesn't warrant a DSA. We can either postpone it until a more
severe OpenVAS issue is found we it can be fixed through a point update.

I'm adding Jonathan Wiltshire to CC. He's coordinating the minor
security fixes, which get fixed through stable-proposed-updates.

Cheers,
        Moritz

Javier,
can you fix this for the upcoming 6.0.4 point update?

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.5) 	- use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

Thanks,

with his security hat on:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=716367#c0)  Ludwig Nussel   2011-09-07 12:55:28 UTC  ``` Your friendly security team received the following report via oss-security. Please respond ASAP. The issue is public.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Date: Wed, 07 Sep 2011 14:13:45 +0200 From: Jan Lieskovsky <jlieskov@redhat.com> Subject: [oss-security] CVE Request -- openvas-scanner -- Insecure temporary file use by  generation of an OVAL system characteristics document, when ovaldi support  enabled  Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,     it was reported that the scanner module for the Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) used insecure way for creation of a temporary file, when generating OVAL system characteristics document from the knowledge base data available, with the ovaldi integrated tool enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the system, accessible with the privileges of the user running the SLAD daemon and / or the ovaldi OVAL interpreter.

Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=716367#c1)  Ludwig Nussel   2011-09-08 10:51:26 UTC  ``` Upstream response: <http://seclists.org/openvas/2011/q3/233> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=716367#c2)  Sebastian Krahmer   2011-09-12 07:10:21 UTC  ``` CVE-2011-3351 ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=736317#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-07 12:08:39 UTC  ``` It was reported that the scanner module for the Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) used insecure way for creation of a temporary file, when generating OVAL system characteristics document from the knowledge base data available, with the ovaldi integrated tool enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks to overwrite arbitrary files on the system, accessible with the privileges of the user running the SLAD daemon and / or the ovaldi OVAL interpreter.

... there shouldn t be a limit at

oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

### [tyhicks](https://launchpad.net/~tyhicks)

Several mitigating factors here: Yama's symlink protection
(10.10 and newer), requires non-standard configuration, and a
openvas plugin that is not available in the archive
