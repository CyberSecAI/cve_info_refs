Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3360:

**Root Cause:** Insecure load path handling in Wireshark allowed the execution of arbitrary Lua scripts.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from Wireshark's failure to properly restrict the loading of Lua scripts, enabling an attacker to potentially execute malicious code through manipulated script paths.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution on the system running Wireshark. This could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:** The primary attack vector is through a method similar to DLL hijacking, where the attacker could manipulate the environment where Wireshark runs to cause it to load and execute a malicious Lua script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to find a way to cause Wireshark to load a malicious Lua script. This would likely involve placing the malicious script in a location where Wireshark would search for Lua scripts and then making Wireshark load a capture or other file that triggers the vulnerable code path. The attacker needs to know the environment where Wireshark is running, so they can place the malicious Lua script in the correct directory.
- The attacker needs to have some knowledge of Wireshark's Lua scripting functionality and its load paths.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.1 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.8.
- It was fixed in versions 1.6.2 and 1.4.9.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Microsoft Vulnerability Research group.
- The issue was also referred to as "Wireshark Arbitrary Script Execution Vulnerability" (MSVR-11-0078).
