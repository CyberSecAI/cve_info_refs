Use CVE-2011-3360 for the above.

Are the below worth assigning CVE ids to? The advisory seems to suggest
they are crash only fixes. Do those deserve CVE IDs? I know we've been
fairly generous with wireshark in the past, but I'm wondering if we need to
draw a line somewhere.

Package        : wireshark
Vulnerability  : programming error
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3360

The Microsoft Vulnerability Research group discovered that insecure
load path handling could lead to execution of arbitrary Lua script code.
