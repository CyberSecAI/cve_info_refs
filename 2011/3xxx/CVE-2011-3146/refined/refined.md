```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a type mismatch when handling SVG nodes. librsvg uses the node name to identify the node type when building nodes. If the node name starts with `fe` it will be treated as a `RsvgFilterPrimitive`. When rendering, the `rsvg_filter_primitive_render` function will attempt to call `render()` which will lead to a crash if it is not a valid `RsvgFilterPrimitive`.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper type checking",
    "Use of node name instead of node type"
  ],
  "Impact": "Opening a crafted SVG file can cause the application to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted SVG file is opened by an application using the vulnerable `librsvg` library.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft an SVG file and have it opened by a program using the vulnerable library.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerability occurs in the `rsvg_filter_primitive_render` function. The fix involves storing the node type separately in `RsvgNode` to avoid the type mismatch."
