Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2011-3605:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `process_rs()` function of the `radvd` daemon.
- When the `UnicastOnly` option is enabled, `process_rs()` calls the `mdelay()` function unconditionally.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary weakness is that `mdelay()` is called on the same thread responsible for handling all input. This means that while `mdelay()` is active, the daemon can't process other requests.
- **Input Queue Saturation:** An attacker can exploit this by flooding the daemon with ND_ROUTER_SOLICIT messages. This can fill the input queue with requests, causing a delay in processing new clients.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Temporary Denial of Service:** The `radvd` daemon becomes temporarily unresponsive to new clients.
- **Delayed Processing:** New clients experience delays in receiving Router Advertisements (RA), potentially leading to network connectivity issues for those clients.
- **Outage Duration:** The duration of the outage is directly related to `MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME` (default 500ms) and the size of the input queue. The content estimates this can cause delays of more than a minute.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:**  Attackers send a flood of ND_ROUTER_SOLICIT messages to the vulnerable radvd daemon.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker does not need physical access to the machine, only network connectivity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the radvd daemon or be able to send network packets to it.
- **UnicastOnly Mode:** The target radvd daemon must be configured with the `UnicastOnly` option enabled. This is *not* the default mode, so it needs to be explicitly configured by the administrator.
- **Ability to Send ND_ROUTER_SOLICIT:** The attacker needs the ability to generate and send IPv6 Router Solicitation messages.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the use of the `UnicastOnly` configuration in `radvd`. The default "anycast" mode does not exhibit this denial-of-service behavior.
- The content from openwall.com mentions a pre-disclosure discussion on the linux-distros list.
- The ubuntu.com content provides specific details about the fix in various versions of Ubuntu.

In summary, CVE-2011-3605 is a temporary DoS vulnerability in radvd's `process_rs()` function when configured in `UnicastOnly` mode. It can be exploited remotely by flooding the daemon with Router Solicitations, resulting in delayed processing and a temporary denial of service for new clients.
