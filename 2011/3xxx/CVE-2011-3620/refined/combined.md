| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=747078#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-18 18:02:13 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in qpid where it would accept any password or SASL mechanism, provided the remote user knew a valid cluster username.  This would give a malicious remote attacker unauthorized access to the cluster where they would be able to receive replicated messages to the cluster, be able to send any cluster message, mark any present message as consumed, run any job on the cluster, and also view/modify/create other users' jobs.  Only cluster messages and internal qpid/MRG configuration is accessible to the remote attacker.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=747078#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-18 19:02:18 UTC  ``` For an attacker to successfully exploit this flaw, they would need to have physical access to the wired private interconnect LAN in which to plug in their own system.  Typically, MRG interconnect is done by physical wiring to a secondary NIC on a cluster member, dedicated to the interconnect.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=747078#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-30 17:52:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5 v. 2  Via RHSA-2012:0529 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0529.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=747078#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-30 17:54:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:0528 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0528.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=747078#c6)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-30 18:06:22 UTC  ``` Created qpid-cpp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 817644](show_bug.cgi?id=817644 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2011-3620 qpid-cpp: cluster authentication ignores cluster-* settings [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=747078#c7)  Vincent Danen    2012-05-07 20:58:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  This flaw only affects the clustered implementation in qpid-cpp (qpidd-cpp-server-cluster) which is only available in Red Hat Enterprise MRG.  The qpid-cpp-server as provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 does not include this functionality, and is thus not affected.   ``` |  |

Description
```
QPID-3652: Fix cluster authentication.

Only allow brokers that authenticate as the cluster-username to join a cluster.

New broker first connects to  a cluster broker authenticates as the cluster-username
and sends its CPG member ID to the qpid.cluster-credentials exchange.
The cluster broker that subsequently acts as updater verifies that the credentials are
valid before connecting to give the update.

NOTE: If you are using an ACL, the cluster-username must be allowed to
publish to the qpid.cluster-credentials exchange. E.g. in your ACL file:

acl allow foo@QPID publish exchange name=qpid.cluster-credentials
```

Testing Done
```
3 new tests in cluster_tests.py, tested by hand with ANONYMOUS, PLAIN and DIGEST-MD5 mechanisms.
```

Seems ok to me...

```
The last sentence in this comment isn't entirely true... it will only compare the id against the username if the userid of the connection was in the default domain. Not a big issue, I just got confused when first reading this.

   Updated to:     * If id has the default realm will also compare plain username.

Does isDefaultRealm get initialised anywhere?

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
