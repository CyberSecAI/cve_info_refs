Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The Qpid broker cluster authentication mechanism did not properly validate cluster-related parameters like `cluster-mechanism`, `cluster-username`, and `cluster-password`.
- It accepted any password or SASL mechanism if the connecting node presented a valid cluster username.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Insufficient Authentication:** The cluster authentication process was flawed, allowing nodes with a valid cluster username, to join without proper password or mechanism verification.
- **Bypass of Security Controls:** The `cluster-*` settings meant to enforce authentication were effectively ignored.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Cluster Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to the cluster if they knew a valid cluster username.
- **Data Manipulation and Disclosure:** Once in the cluster, attackers could:
    - Receive replicated messages.
    - Send arbitrary cluster messages.
    - Mark any message as consumed.
    - Run arbitrary jobs on the cluster.
    - View, modify, or create other users' jobs.
- **Compromise of Internal Infrastructure:** The attacker had access to cluster messages and internal Qpid/MRG configuration which could be exploited further.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker required physical access to the wired private interconnect LAN where the cluster members were connected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Physical Access:** Attackers needed to be on the same physical network as the cluster members.
- **Valid Cluster Username:** The attacker needed to know a valid cluster username to initiate the attack.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability only affected the clustered implementation of Qpid-cpp (`qpidd-cpp-server-cluster`), which was primarily used in Red Hat Enterprise MRG.
- The standard `qpid-cpp-server` as provided with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was not affected, as it did not include the clustering functionality.
- The fix required ensuring that brokers joining the cluster authenticate properly using the cluster username and the specified mechanism.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG Messaging 2.1 via RHSA-2012:0528 and RHSA-2012:0529.

This detailed analysis provides more specific information than the basic CVE description, which only states:
"qpid-cpp: cluster authentication ignores cluster-\* settings".
