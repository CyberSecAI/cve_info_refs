    {
      "source": "bugs.launchpad.net_1c1f68f9_20250124_125258.html",
      "rootCause": "The pam_motd module in PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) does not properly sanitize the environment when executing scripts in `/etc/update-motd.d/`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized environment variables",
        "Use of `system()` call to execute shell commands"
      ],
      "impact": "A local attacker can gain root privileges by manipulating the `$PATH` environment variable to point to a directory containing malicious executables that will be run by the scripts in `/etc/update-motd.d/`.",
      "attackVectors": "Local access by modifying the $PATH environment variable",
       "requiredCapabilities": "A non-root user must be able to modify their PATH environment variable and must have access to a PAM configuration where `pam_motd.so` is used in such a way that the user's environment is not controlled, like `/etc/pam.d/su`."

    {
      "source": "www.ubuntu.com_2f64307d_20250124_125257.html",
      "rootCause": "The PAM `pam_motd` module incorrectly cleaned the environment during execution of the motd scripts.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Unsanitized environment variables during script execution"
       ],
       "impact": "A local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code as root, and gain privileges.",
      "attackVectors": "Local access by exploiting unsanitized environment variables",
      "requiredCapabilities": "Local attacker needs to control environment prior to execution of the PAM stack. This is done by modifying the `PATH` variable and having `pam_motd.so` present in a PAM config that is vulnerable."
