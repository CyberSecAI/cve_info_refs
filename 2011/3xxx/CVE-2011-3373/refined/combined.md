| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=740553#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-22 12:45:42 UTC  ``` The Drupal views module provides a flexible method for Drupal site designers to control how lists of content (nodes) are presented. The Views Bulk Operations (VBO) Drupal module module augments views by allowing bulk operations to be executed on the nodes displayed by a view. It does so by showing a check box in front of each node, and adding a select box containing operations that can be applied on the selected nodes.  It was found in the way Drupal Views Builk Operations (VBO) module did not escape the vocabulary help properly, when the vocabulary has had user tagging enabled and "Modify node taxonomy terms" action was used for modification of the taxonomy. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by unsuspecting Drupal user, disposing with the 'administer taxonomy' permission, could lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution (cross-site scripting [XSS] attack).

Subject: CVE Request -- drupal6-views_bulk_operations: XSS due improper escaping
 of a vocabulary help (SA-CONTRIB-2011-042)

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it was found in the way Drupal Views Builk Operations (VBO) module
did not escape the vocabulary help properly, when the vocabulary has
had user tagging enabled and "Modify node taxonomy terms" action was
used for modification of the taxonomy. A remote attacker could provide
a specially-crafted URL, which once visited by unsuspecting Drupal
user, disposing with the 'administer taxonomy' permission / privilege,
could lead to arbitrary HTML or web script execution (cross-site
scripting [XSS] attack).

Upstream solution:

Upgrage to 6.x-1.11:
[4] <http://drupal.org/node/1286778>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
