Subject: Re: CVE Request: Multiple issues fixed in wireshark
 1.6.2

----- Original Message -----

> 2. Wireshark Lua script execution vulnerability

Use CVE-2011-3360 for the above.

Are the below worth assigning CVE ids to? The advisory seems to suggest
they are crash only fixes. Do those deserve CVE IDs? I know we've been
fairly generous with wireshark in the past, but I'm wondering if we need to
draw a line somewhere.

Crash-only issues are always/typically worth a CVE when it can prevent a
product from working in a security context.  Wireshark monitors network
traffic, sometimes live; therefore, in some reasonable/common usage
scenarios, attackers can cause a crash and prevent network activities from
being detected.

We apply similar logic in forensics and other scenarios.  Therefore a CVE
is needed for both wnpa-sec-2011-12 (crash reading live packets) as well
as wnpa-sec-2011-14 (by only reading a packet trace file) - in the latter,
analysis of a packet trace could be hampered/delayed because the
investigator can't use the product without it crashing.

Wireshark does not get any more "preference" than any other tool, except
indirectly because it gets more attention.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.
