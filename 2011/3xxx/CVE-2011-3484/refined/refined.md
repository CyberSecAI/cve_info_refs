Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-3484:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the OpenSafety dissector of Wireshark.
- A large loop within the dissector's code could lead to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is an uncontrolled loop that can be triggered by a malformed packet.
- This lack of proper bounds checking in the dissector leads to a denial-of-service vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact of successful exploitation is a crash of the Wireshark application.
- This crash can prevent network traffic analysis, either by disrupting live captures or when attempting to read packet trace files.
- In a security context, it can prevent detection of malicious network activities or hinder/delay forensic analysis.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malformed OpenSafety packet.
- This packet can be injected onto the network or included in a crafted packet trace file.
- An attacker could either inject a malformed packet onto the wire or convince a user to open a malicious trace file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to introduce malformed OpenSafety packets into a network being monitored or provide a malformed capture file to a user of Wireshark.
- No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability, simply the ability to craft the malicious packets or capture files.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.1.
- It was fixed in Wireshark version 1.6.2.
- The vulnerability is referenced in Wireshark bug 6138 and is identified by the Wireshark advisory wnpa-sec-2011-12.
- Red Hat stated that versions of wireshark shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6 were not vulnerable to this issue.
