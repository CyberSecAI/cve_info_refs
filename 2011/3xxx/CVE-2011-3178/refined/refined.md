Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3178

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a code injection flaw within the web UI of the openbuildservice. Specifically, the `mkdiststats` script's `scheduler` parameter was not properly sanitized before being used in a command executed by the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Code Injection: The primary vulnerability is the injection of malicious code through the unsanitized `scheduler` parameter. This allows for arbitrary command execution by a malicious actor.
- Lack of Input Sanitization: The web UI failed to validate or sanitize user-provided input for the `scheduler` parameter, allowing for the injection of arbitrary shell code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server running the openbuildservice. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, denial of service attacks, or other malicious activities.
- Full System Compromise: The vulnerability potentially allows an attacker to take control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attack is initiated through the web UI of the openbuildservice, accessible over a network.
- Malicious HTTP Request: The attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request that includes shell code in the `scheduler` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authorized User: The attacker needs to be an authorized user of the openbuildservice, meaning they would have had to have logged in.
- Network Access: The attacker requires network access to the openbuildservice's web UI.
- Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter: The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `scheduler` parameter, but this is now publicly documented.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in the openbuildservice web UI before version 2.3.0.
- A commit `cbfe2ed36dd77c0843702935dea7f914bb599201` addresses this issue by adding input validation for the scheduler parameter and was included in version 2.1.13
- The vulnerability is rated as high severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8
