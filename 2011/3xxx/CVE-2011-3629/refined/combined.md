Huh?

<http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure.html>

and

<http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure.html>

are entirely different issues (one is "Weak encryption causes potential
information disclosure" the other is "Inadequate error checking causes
potential information disclosure."), so two issues, two CVE's. We split
based on (among other things) the underlying issues, not the outcome.

These two CVE's are fine.

Subject: CVE-request: Joomla core information disclosure 372-20111003

After discussion with Kurt we decided these three issues need own CVE-identifiers:

<http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/370-20111001-core-information-disclosure> (CVE-2011-3629)
<http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/371-20111002-core-information-disclosure> (CVE-2011-4937)
<http://developer.joomla.org/security/news/372-20111003-core-information-disclosure>

These all were previously refered as CVE-2011-3629. Now I need CVE-identifier for 372-20111003, which should be 2011. I can email about these to MITRE after assignment to get these updates in CVE-list:

======================================================

<http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q1/524> so the CVE seems to be CVE-2011-3629. Sorry again for the hassle. I think CVE-2011-4937 is now duplicate. How do we get Joomla's security personnel to request CVE-identifiers by themselves and add them to advisories? They do belong to oCERT.
