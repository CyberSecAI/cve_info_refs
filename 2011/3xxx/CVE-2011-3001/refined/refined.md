{
  "CVE-2011-3001": {
    "Description": "Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.",
    "Root cause": "A flaw in the manual plugin installation process using the `PLUGINSPAGE` attribute. It was possible to create an internal error that suppressed a confirmation dialog, such that holding enter would lead to the installation of an arbitrary add-on.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Bypassing the confirmation dialog for plugin installation through the PLUGINSPAGE attribute.",
        "The ability to install an arbitrary extension by holding the Enter key during a plugin install process."
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution by installing malicious extensions without user consent.",
        "Unwanted installation of arbitrary add-ons, potentially leading to compromised browser functionality, data exfiltration, or further malicious activities",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Convincing a user to hold down the Enter key on a malicious webpage.",
      "Exploiting a logic error in `amWebInstallListener.js` to suppress a confirmation dialog.",
       "Using a specially crafted HTML page with a pluginspage attribute to trigger a manual plugin installation dialog."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious web page and convince a user to interact with the page (hold down the Enter key)."
