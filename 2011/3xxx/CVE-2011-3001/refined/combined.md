# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-40

## Code installation through holding down `Enter`

Announced
September 27, 2011
Reporter
Mariusz Mlynski
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.23
* Firefox 7
* SeaMonkey 2.4
* Thunderbird 3.1.15
* Thunderbird 7

### Description

**Mariusz Mlynski** reported that if you could convince
a user to hold down the `Enter` key--as part of a game or test,
perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a download dialog where the held
key would then activate the default Open action. For some file types this
would be merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would provide an
avenue for an attacker to exploit a vulnerability in applications not
normally exposed to potentially hostile internet content.

Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin installation
using the `PLUGINSPAGE` attribute. It was possible to create
an internal error that suppressed a confirmation dialog, such that holding
enter would lead to the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant
did not affect Firefox 3.6)

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

It is possible to install an arbitrary XPI without user's consent if the user holds Enter on a malicious website containing a specially crafted JavaScript code.
There are 2 layers of protection against an unauthorized installation of extensions:
1) The principal of the opener is checked against whitelisted domains that are allowed to download the plugin without asking. If the domain is not trusted, the user is asked to allow to download the plugin.
2) When the plugin is downloaded, the user is asked to confirm the installation.
The first protection can be circumvented by creating a hidden "Embed" element containing an arbitrary XPI as its "pluginspage" parameter. The attacker can focus this element while the user holds Enter, causing a number of "Plugin Finder Service" windows to appear. The first window focuses the "Cancel" button and will just close, but all the subsequent ones will set focus on the "Manual Install" button directing to the malicious XPI. As soon as the user releases the key, the browser will start launching multiple windows with the provided URL. The windows will have a ChromeWindow object as their opener, so the user will not be asked to allow to download a plugin.
The second protection can be bypassed due to a logic error in amWebInstallListener.js. When no window-watcher is registered in Services, this will throw:
Services.ww.openWindow(this.window, "chrome://mozapps/content/xpinstall/xpinstallConfirm.xul",null, "chrome,modal,centerscreen", args);
with the following message in the console:
Warning: WARN addons.manager: InstallListener threw exception when calling onDownloadEnded: TypeError: Services.ww is undefined
Source File: resource://gre/components/amWebInstallListener.js
Line: 170
When the confirmation dialog fails to open, the installation will commence as though the user clicked "Install".
Getting the browser into a state in which Services.ww is permanently undefined can be achieved with no user interaction by using a modified version of [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=616659](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursing the JavaScript eval function over itself eventually causes all dialogs with confirmation to evaluate to \"true\".") on a signed website. Exploiting it locally will likely bring about corrupt windows and a lot of errors in the console, but Services.ww will be defined. On a remote signed website, with the try-catch-inside-eval recursion performed during page load, after an alert dialog which prevents "too much recursion" error from occuring, it fails silently and Services.ww remains undefined for the whole browsing session, ie. Firefox will not ask to confirm a plugin installation until the user restarts the browser. The only mitigating factor is that if Services.ww was defined earlier in the browser session, the exploit may fail and corrupt windows will appear (hence point #2 in the steps described below, after opening windows to import the certificate). This was noticed by Zach Hoffman in [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=616659#c37](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659#c37 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursing the JavaScript eval function over itself eventually causes all dialogs with confirmation to evaluate to \"true\".") but the implications there were reverse.
There may be other ways to wind up with Services.ww undefined, but those should be safe as long as the plugin installation is stopped when xpinstallConfirm.xul fails to open.
Reproducible: always (as long as Services.ww wasn't defined earlier in the browsing session)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Import x509.cert for software makers identification.
2. Close the browser and reopen after the process shuts down.
3. Open jar:[http://x.x.x.x/mozilla/signed.jar!exploit.htm](http://x.x.x.x/mozilla/signed.jar%21exploit.htm) (see [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation."))
4. Press and hold enter.
Actual results:
The plugin is automatically downloaded and installed.
Expected results:
The plugin should neither be downloaded nor installed without user's consent.
Verified to work with Firefox 5.0.1 on Windows 7 SP1 64-bit and Windows XP SP3 32-bit.

Ah, one more thing: if the exploit fails, ie. Services.ww happens to be already defined in the browsing session causing display of corrupt windows after loading the page, and you deny privileges to stop windows from popping-up, then make sure to remove these lines from prefs.js before retrying:
user\_pref("capability.principal.certificate.pX.denied", "UniversalXPConnect");
user\_pref("capability.principal.certificate.pX.id", "BF:94:EA:8A:E8:55:BC:EE:59:0C:4B:0B:6D:3B:09:80:9D:9D:F7:0E");
user\_pref("capability.principal.certificate.pX.subjectName", "CN=a,O=a,OU=a,ST=a,C=aa,UID=a,E=a");
Also, I found that "pluginspage" windows open a bit slow with with ChromeBug 1.7.2 installed, so be advised to turn it off if you have it enabled.

This is a pretty confused bug report. If you give any website UniversalXPConnect, you've lost (there are much easier ways to exploit a user once you've got UniversalXPConnect). We're removing support for enablePrivilege, so I don't think that part of the bug is a concern.
It's also not clear to me: are you saying that [bug 616659](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursing the JavaScript eval function over itself eventually causes all dialogs with confirmation to evaluate to \"true\".") is not fixed?
Nevertheless, there are a few bits of this report that do concern me:
\* embed pluginspage= can bypass the XPI whitelist (an annoyance hole, but not strictly a security bug)
\* the pluginspage frame opens with a ChromeWindow opener (a security bug, but one I think we will have fixed in FF6 or 7)
\* If the confirmation dialog fails, we should just stop, rather than continuing

OK, let me rephrase:
If you run the following code:
alert('Welcome aboard!');
function xpl(){
eval("try{xpl()}catch(b){netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege('UniversalXPConnect')}");
}
try{xpl()}catch(e){};
then, provided that Services.ww wasn't defined earlier in the browsing session, no windows asking for an elevated privilege will appear. The browser will fail to display any windows, and the user will not be asked for an elevated privilege! Instead, the browser will be in a state in which Services.ww is not defined, which allows to install a plug-in without asking due to a bug in resource://gre/components/amWebInstallListener.js. My report has nothing to do with granting UniversalXPConnect privileges, nor it is required that the user grants any elevated privileges, please reread it.
This bug: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=616659](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursing the JavaScript eval function over itself eventually causes all dialogs with confirmation to evaluate to \"true\".") is fixed in that corrupt windows that may appear (if Services.ww was defined earlier in the browsing session) will not evaluate to true when closed. While fiddling with that code, I found that if the windows fail to display, Services.ww is undefined, which allows to install plugins without any confirmation.
I can provide the video of running the exploit if needed.

It's not clear to me how you're making Services.ww undefined. Is there some example code that does that?

As stated in the first post:
"On a remote signed website, with the try-catch-inside-eval recursion performed during page load, after an alert dialog which prevents "too much recursion" error from occuring, it fails silently and Services.ww remains undefined for the whole browsing session"
Where "it" is the following code:
function xpl(){
eval("try{xpl()}catch(b){netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege('UniversalXPConnect')}");
}
try{xpl()}catch(e){};
Thus, the effective script is:
<script>
alert('anything');
function xpl(){
eval("try{xpl()}catch(b){netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege('UniversalXPConnect')}");
}
try{xpl()}catch(e){};
</script>
If it's run on a remote signed website before any other windows (not tabs) were launched in the browsing session, then Services.ww remains undefined for the rest of this browsing session, which in turn allows to install plugins without confirming.

Btw, jar:[http:...signed.jar!/exploit.htm](http:///...signed.jar%21/exploit.htm) linked in [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.") does exactly that on load, after closing the pop-up. On all computers (Win XP/7) I've tried, Services.ww was permanently undefined after following the first 3 steps from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.") (+closing the "welcome" alert), and Firefox did not ask to confirm installation (xpinstallConfirm.xul) after I held and released Enter or navigated from the exploit page to AMO and clicked any of the "add to Firefox" buttons. With a malicious third party with an access to a proper certificate from a trusted CA, just steps 3 and 4 are necessary to have an arbitrary extension installed in the browser.

So far on OSX the only result of running this code is a stalled browser that won't respond to input, no extension install.

On Windows 7 the testcase did something more, after holding enter for a while the install missing plugins bar appeared and it attempted to stop me leaving the page, but no add-on got downloaded that I can see, Services.ww was showing as defined after that.

Dave, what version did you check? The proof of concept is suited for the current public release (5.0.1).
I've made 2 short videos to show how the proof of concept behaves here in v5.0.1 (select HD and fullscreen for the best quality):
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPy2Ivq3MxQ> - Windows 7 SP1, the key was imported before recording the video.
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I96N-iZJoe8> - Windows XP SP3, shows the full process including the key import. This works a little bit slower due to a combination of video capturing and running things in a VM.
Enter was released as soon as the counter froze completely.

I filed this as a security bug a few months ago ;) [Bug 655916](/show_bug.cgi?id=655916 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - PFS window should not link to page-supplied \"pluginspage\" URL").
> Getting the browser into a state in which Services.ww is permanently undefined
Jeepers. This is why we need separate recursion limits for chrome & content. And why we need to NS\_RUNTIMEABORT when chrome js hits OOM or TMR -- we can't possibly audit our chrome js against the possibility that at any bytecode instruction the script could just stop executing.

I think the key for me is that, yes we could amend amWebInstallListener.js to behave in the case where Services.ww is undefined, but if things like that can be undefined then code all over the place is going to break. We should fix whatever is causing that.

> I was testing the latest nightly builds.
I've checked the latest nightly build and I think the reason why you hadn't seen any windows while holding Enter is as follows:
In Firefox 5.0.1, the Embed element for an unsupported plugin looks like this: <http://i.imgur.com/FTlKX.png> -- the entire box links to Plugin Finder Service, it's also sufficient to focus the Embed element to get PFS windows while just holding Enter.
Nightly (8.0a1 2011-07-21) implements this feature as shown here: <http://i.imgur.com/BiVtr.png> -- the link is nested deep inside the XUL box, that's why focusing the Embed element isn't sufficient. However, it's possible to obtain a reference to the link if the user clicks within the boundaries of the XUL box (essentially anywhere on the page, as you can follow the cursor with the XUL element). The link can be focused subsequently. I will attach a simple test that shows how it's done.
Btw, from what I'm seeing, Services.ww can end up in the undefined state in the Nightly build (ie. the implications of a successful attempt are exactly the same), although there are more failures (broken windows after the try-catch recursion) where 5.0.1 would have a 100% success rate. It looks that the exploit works more reliably with the release build.

I appear to have fixed the leak, though I don't understand how (but I'd like to!). This leaked:
delete Services.ww;
... do stuff ...
Services.ww = Cc["..."].getService(Ci.nsIWindowWatcher);
This doesn't:
var gWindowWatcher = Services.ww;
delete Services.ww;
... do stuff ...
Services.ww = gWindowWatcher;
However... I found another issue, where it was sending the addon-install-failed notification with an empty array of addons. And fixing that broke a bunch of assumptions the addons manager (and it's tests) make about how installs are expected to fail. Working on a new patch.

Waiting on Try results, just because I'm paranoid. But testing locally, the leak is gone, and the tests pass.
I looked into making the install actually fail (rather than just be canceled), but it would require adding a new API.

I can reproduce this locally with the first version of the patch, but not the second, so I looked at the first version to see if that might help. I used the steps described in
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=561359#c60](/show_bug.cgi?id=561359#c60 "RESOLVED FIXED - \"Assertion failure: &shape.methodObject() == &prev.toObject(),\"")
There are two nsGlobalWindows being kept alive in the cycle collector via ChromeWindows:
0x11a913c58 [JS Object (ChromeWindow) (global=11a913c58)]
--[xpc\_GetJSPrivate(obj)]-> 0x11ac15ca0 [XPCWrappedNative (ChromeWindow)]
--[mIdentity]-> 0x11ac14748 [nsGlobalWindow]
0x1238a1e50 [JS Object (ChromeWindow) (global=1238a1e50)]
--[xpc\_GetJSPrivate(obj)]-> 0x11bd43080 [XPCWrappedNative (ChromeWindow)]
--[mIdentity]-> 0x11bd41f38 [nsGlobalWindow]
These ChromeWindows have been marked as reachable by the JS GC.
Looking at the GC dump, one of the ChromeWindows (0x11a913c58) seems to be kept alive because it is on the machine stack. I only have one path for the other ChromeWindow, which says that it is being held alive via the first ChromeWindow, but there may be another path, too.
I think being stored on the machine stack means it is being kept in a local variable somehow, but I'm not sure. I'll see if I can get more information about how that is happening, but given that it uses a conservative stack scanner I am not too hopeful.
Maybe this will help...

The leak didn't go away when I undid the changes in amWebInstallListener.js, so I guess it is a problem with the test itself?

I don't know about the leak (xpinstall tests are somewhat hard to follow because of the custom "Harness"), but I'd like to point out that messing with Services.ww like the patch does isn't nice at all, since you're sharing the browser with all other browser-chrome tests. E.g. if some chrome code runs simultaneously with your test and breaks, this might cause issues for all subsequent tests.

AFAICT, yea. Which confuses me more, since it's a simple test using a harness that's already used by many other tests, without leaks.

I know. But that's the whole point of the test. So the alternative is to not have the test (which would make solving the leak a lot easier...).

Affecting random other code isn't point of the test...

If you're confident that the leak isn't caused by your code, sure. You should probably file a bug on the leak, though, in case this issue already exists and your test just unveils it.

As a side note, the other issue highlighted in the exploit (non-whitelisted site can trigger xpinstall from pluginspage due to a ChromeWindow opener) is not resolved yet. With amWebInstallListener.js fixed by Blair to stop when xpinstallConfirm.xul fails to open, it shouldn't be possible any more to use it to do anything scary (at least without user's consent), but it may be worth fixing.

Patch v1.1
This is essentially a drive-by install (a little bit of easily lured user interaction). Why in the world would we not take this simple patch to prevent that? Patch and testcase checked into trunk/aurora raises the risk of someone else figuring this out.
Renominating for Firefox 7 beta

Not sure if this applies to Firefox 3.6.x or not. The patch doesn't, there's no equivalent use of Services.ww in the old code. I don't think anything was done here about the reporters first point in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation."), but I did see that effect in any of the testcases attached or linked-to by this bug.

It doesn't, the old code defines its own window watcher:
var ww = Cc["@mozilla.org/embedcomp/window-watcher;1"].getService(Ci.nsIWindowWatcher);
ww.openWindow(null, URI\_XPINSTALL\_CONFIRM\_DIALOG,"", "chrome,centerscreen,modal,dialog,titlebar", ifptr);
if (!dpb.GetInt(0)) {// User said OK - install items
I see no way it could fail and proceed with the installation at the same time.

I'm not sure if this is fixed or if I am testing this wrong. Here is what I did:
1) Import the attached cert
2) Close Firefox and restart after the process is closed
3) Go the the website in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.") (404'd so I'm guessing this is broken)
4) Go to attached Proof-of-Concept
5) Click the button on the page
6) Press ENTER key
Result:
Plugin installer dialog appears

It's up and running (a slash was missing, see [comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c5 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.")), although it didn't take account of the different "missing plugin" XUL box in the newer versions of Firefox (see [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.")). I've now repacked signed.jar to include a new file exploitn.htm, which uses the pluginspage link focus method from [attachment 547601](/attachment.cgi?id=547601 "Test focusing pluginspage install link in Nightly build.") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=547601&action=edit "Test focusing pluginspage install link in Nightly build."), so you can just replace "signed.jar!/exploit.htm" with "signed.jar!/exploitn.htm" and proceed as described if you're not using Firefox 5.
Btw, check out the last paragraph in [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation."). If it happens to throw corrupt windows after the alert dialog, kill the process and retry.
> 6) Press ENTER key
And hold it down until the counter freezes.
Firefox 7.0b6, Windows 7 SP1, using a fairly fresh user profile: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=044-OTl0TZw> (xpinstallConfirm.xul fails to open, but the extension is not installed)

I've checked the logs and the last link you were trying to access (with a slash after "!" and "exploitn.htm" as the internal filename) was correct, you just missed the "jar:" prefix before "http:", hence 404.

Okay, I reran the steps with the correct URL and here is my result.
Firefox 9.0a2 on Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit. Is this expected given the bug is "resolved"?

> Firefox 9.0a2 on Ubuntu 11.04 64-bit. Is this expected given the bug is

Yes, it seems that the trick to keep Services.ww unregistered failed, so there's no sign of any incorrect behaviour (except the thing mentioned in [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c42 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation."): the ChromeWindow opener allows the confirm dialog to appear without asking), thus it's all good. It may well be that clobbering enablePrivilege in the callback to keep ww from being defined is a Windows-specific thing -- I've never tested it on Unix/Mac, and on Windows in the most recent Firefox versions it's either a complete failure or a complete success (up to the point of Blair's fix, which silently cancels the installation).

Yes, I think so, there's no way it can be exploited in FF7+, and the problem described in [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=672485#c42 "VERIFIED FIXED - Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation.") will be resolved with the fix to [bug 655916](/show_bug.cgi?id=655916 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - PFS window should not link to page-supplied \"pluginspage\" URL").

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.1.14, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products.
Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 6. (CVE-2011-2995)
Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight, Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor
Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and Marcia Knous
reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 6,
fixed in Firefox 7. (CVE-2011-2997)
MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that
a frame named "location" could shadow the window.location
object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. Because some
plugins use the value of window.location to determine the
page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the
plugin content access to another site or the local file
system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
(CVE-2011-2999)
MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that
when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect
response Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers:
Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome
and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of
this header with different values could be a symptom of a
CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most
commonly it is the Location header itself that is
vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy
preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious
one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server
vulnerability.
The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two
copies of this header with different values as an error
condition. The same has been done with the headers
Content-Length and Content-Disposition. (CVE-2011-3000)
MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could
convince a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a
game or test, perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a
download dialog where the held key would then activate the
default Open action. For some file types this would be
merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a
vulnerability in applications not normally exposed to
potentially hostile internet content.
Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin
installation using the PLUGINSPAGE attribute. It was
possible to create an internal error that suppressed a
confirmation dialog, such that holding enter would lead to
the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant did
not affect Firefox 3.6)
Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to
Download Manager (CVE-2011-2372)
Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation
(CVE-2011-3001)
MFSA 2011-42: Security researcher Aki Helin reported a
potentially exploitable crash in the YARR regular
expression library used by JavaScript. (CVE-2011-3232)
MFSA 2011-44: sczimmer reported that Firefox crashed when
loading a particular .ogg file. This was due to a
use-after-free condition and could potentially be exploited
to install malware. (CVE-2011-3005)
This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6 or earlier.
