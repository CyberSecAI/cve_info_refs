{
  "cve": "CVE-2011-3170",
  "description": "The CUPS image library incorrectly handled LZW streams, specifically not handling the first code word in an LZW stream properly. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect handling of the first code word in an LZW stream within the CUPS image library's GIF decoder.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The GIF decoder doesn't handle the first code word of the LZW stream properly, leading to a potential overflow."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending crafted print jobs containing malicious GIF images to a CUPS server."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send print jobs to a vulnerable CUPS server. This can be done over the network.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located in the `filter/image-gif.c` file of the CUPS source code. This was patched in CUPS versions 1.4.3-1ubuntu1.5, 1.4.4-6ubuntu2.4, 1.4.6-5ubuntu1.4, and 1.3.7-1ubuntu3.13. The issue is related to how CUPS processes LZW encoded data in GIF images. An incorrect code word can cause an overflow."
