How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# CUPS: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201207-10**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in CUPS, some of which may
allow execution of arbitrary code or local privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-print/cups** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.4.8-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.4.8-r1** |

### Background

CUPS, the Common Unix Printing System, is a full-featured print server.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in CUPS. Please review the
CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code using specially
crafted streams, IPP requests or files, or cause a Denial of Service
(daemon crash or hang). A local attacker may be able to gain escalated
privileges or overwrite arbitrary files. Furthermore, a remote attacker
may be able to obtain sensitive information from the CUPS process or
hijack a CUPS administrator authentication request.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All CUPS users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-print/cups-1.4.8-r1"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since September 03, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:22:38 UTC  ``` GIF image file format readers in various open source projects are based on the GIF decoder implementation written by David Koblas.  This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress ([CVE-2011-2895](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2895), [bug #727624](show_bug.cgi?id=727624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 BSD compress LZW decoder buffer overflow")), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.  Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:  <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>  In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte():          if (code >= max_code) {             *sp++ = firstcode;             code = oldcode;         }  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          while (code >= clear_code) {             *sp++ = table[1][code];             if (code == table[0][code])                 pm_error("circular table entry BIG ERROR");             code = table[0][code];         }  where:    #define MAX_LWZ_BITS        12   static int  table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)];   static int  stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp;   sp = stack;  This results in stack[] buffer overflow.  If table[][] is located above stack[], stack[] overflow may further modify decoding table and break infinite loop.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:25:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516471](attachment.cgi?id=516471 "giftoppm.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516471&action=edit "giftoppm.c") giftoppm.c  Local copy of the giftoppm.c, extracted from pbmplus_10dec1991.tar.gz, available from: <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:26:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516472](attachment.cgi?id=516472 "Test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516472&action=edit "Test case") Test case  From [bug #714118](show_bug.cgi?id=714118), already public via <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 10:09:02 UTC  ``` As noted above, this GIF reader code is used in several open source projects.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2896 CVE-2011-3170

Petr Sklenar and Tomas Hoger discovered that missing input sanitising in
the GIF decoder inside the Cups printing system could lead to denial
of service or potentially arbitrary code execution through crafted GIF
files.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.8-1+lenny10.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7+squeeze1.

For the testing and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.5.0-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.
