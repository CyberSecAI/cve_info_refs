      "Insufficient handling of HTTP 0.9 requests."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could make a reverse proxy connect to an arbitrary server not directly accessible to the attacker.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted HTTP 0.9 request to an Apache httpd server acting as a reverse proxy."

        "affected_versions": "httpd versions before 2.2.18 and before fix for CVE-2011-3368."
