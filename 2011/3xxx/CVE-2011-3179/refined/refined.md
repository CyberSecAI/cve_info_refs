- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unauthenticated attacker can send specially crafted commands to the Novell/GroupWise Messenger server, which forces the server process to return the contents of arbitrary memory locations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Messenger server handles specific commands, which leads to an arbitrary memory disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the server's memory, including strings containing credentials used by Messenger to authenticate to directory services.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malicious commands over the network to the Messenger server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability. No specific network position is needed other than the ability to reach the vulnerable server.
