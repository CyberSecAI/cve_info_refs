- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When Open Directory is bound to an LDAPv3 server using RFC2307 or custom mappings, and there is no `AuthenticationAuthority` attribute for a user, the system may allow an LDAP user to log in without a password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user may be able to log in without a password.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by logging into a system where Open Directory is bound to an LDAPv3 server without proper `AuthenticationAuthority` attribute configuration using an existing LDAP user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have an existing LDAP user account and the system must be configured such that Open Directory is bound to an LDAPv3 server with an improper attribute configuration.
