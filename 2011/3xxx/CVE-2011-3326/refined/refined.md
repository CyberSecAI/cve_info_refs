{
  "CVE-2011-3326": {
    "description": "A denial of service flaw was found in the way ospfd daemon of the Quagga routing suite processed Link State Update Link-State-Advertisements (LSAs) of type, which was not known to Quagga. A configured OSPF peer could use this flaw to cause the master OSPF daemon (ospfd) to crash.",
    "root_cause": "The ospfd daemon does not properly handle Link State Update LSAs of unknown type.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of service due to improper handling of malformed OSPF packets."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause the ospfd daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service for IP routing.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious OSPF peer sends malformed Link State Update LSAs of unknown type to the vulnerable Quagga ospfd daemon.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have a configured OSPF peer relationship with the vulnerable router or be in the same OSPF broadcast domain."
