Package        : iceape
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2372 CVE-2011-2995 CVE-2011-2998 CVE-2011-2999
                 CVE-2011-3000

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite,
an unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2011-2372

   Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download
   dialog - which has "open" as the default action -, while a user
   presses the ENTER key.

CVE-2011-2995

   Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
   in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
   arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2998

   Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the javascript
   engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2999

   Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
   window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin
   policy.

CVE-2011-3000

   Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
   CRLF injection.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package
only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-8. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

openSUSE Security Update: MozillaThunderbird: Update to Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.14
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2011:1076-2
Rating: important
References: #720264
Affected Products:
openSUSE 11.4
openSUSE 11.3
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that contains security fixes can now be
installed. It includes two new package versions.
Description:
Mozilla Thunderbird was updated to version 3.1.14, fixing
various bugs and security issues.
MFSA 2011-36: Mozilla developers identified and fixed
several memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in
Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. Some of these
bugs showed evidence of memory corruption under certain
circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary
code.
In general these flaws cannot be exploited through email in
the Thunderbird and SeaMonkey products because scripting is
disabled, but are potentially a risk in browser or
browser-like contexts in those products.
Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman reported
memory safety problems that affected Firefox 3.6 and
Firefox 6. (CVE-2011-2995)
Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight, Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor
Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and Marcia Knous
reported memory safety problems that affected Firefox 6,
fixed in Firefox 7. (CVE-2011-2997)
MFSA 2011-38: Mozilla developer Boris Zbarsky reported that
a frame named "location" could shadow the window.location
object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the
true object before the frame was created. Because some
plugins use the value of window.location to determine the
page origin this could fool the plugin into granting the
plugin content access to another site or the local file
system in violation of the Same Origin Policy. This flaw
allows circumvention of the fix added for MFSA 2010-10.
(CVE-2011-2999)
MFSA 2011-39: Ian Graham of Citrix Online reported that
when multiple Location headers were present in a redirect
response Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers:
Mozilla would use the second Location header while Chrome
and Internet Explorer would use the first. Two copies of
this header with different values could be a symptom of a
CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most
commonly it is the Location header itself that is
vulnerable to the response splitting and therefore the copy
preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be the malicious
one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server
vulnerability.
The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two
copies of this header with different values as an error
condition. The same has been done with the headers
Content-Length and Content-Disposition. (CVE-2011-3000)
MFSA 2011-40: Mariusz Mlynski reported that if you could
convince a user to hold down the Enter key--as part of a
game or test, perhaps--a malicious page could pop up a
download dialog where the held key would then activate the
default Open action. For some file types this would be
merely annoying (the equivalent of a pop-up) but other file
types have powerful scripting capabilities. And this would
provide an avenue for an attacker to exploit a
vulnerability in applications not normally exposed to
potentially hostile internet content.
Mariusz also reported a similar flaw with manual plugin
installation using the PLUGINSPAGE attribute. It was
possible to create an internal error that suppressed a
confirmation dialog, such that holding enter would lead to
the installation of an arbitrary add-on. (This variant did
not affect Firefox 3.6)
Holding enter allows arbitrary code execution due to
Download Manager (CVE-2011-2372)
Holding enter allows arbitrary extension installation
(CVE-2011-3001)
MFSA 2011-42: Security researcher Aki Helin reported a
potentially exploitable crash in the YARR regular
expression library used by JavaScript. (CVE-2011-3232)
MFSA 2011-44: sczimmer reported that Firefox crashed when
loading a particular .ogg file. This was due to a
use-after-free condition and could potentially be exploited
to install malware. (CVE-2011-3005)
This vulnerability does not affect Firefox 3.6 or earlier.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-39

## Defense against multiple Location headers due to CRLF Injection

Announced
September 27, 2011
Reporter
Ian Graham
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.23
* Firefox 7
* SeaMonkey 2.4
* Thunderbird 3.1.15
* Thunderbird 7

### Description

**Ian Graham** of Citrix Online reported that when multiple
`Location` headers were present in a redirect response
Mozilla behavior differed from other browsers: Mozilla would use the second
`Location` header while Chrome and Internet Explorer would use
the first. Two copies of this header with different values could be a symptom
of a CRLF injection attack against a vulnerable server. Most commonly it is
the `Location` header itself that is vulnerable to the response
splitting and therefore the copy preferred by Mozilla is more likely to be
the malicious one. It is possible, however, that the first copy was the
injected one depending on the nature of the server vulnerability.

The Mozilla browser engine has been changed to treat two copies of this
header with different values as an error condition. The same has been done
with the headers `Content-Length` and `Content-Disposition`

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : iceweasel
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2372 CVE-2011-2995 CVE-2011-2998 CVE-2011-2999
                 CVE-2011-3000

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Iceweasel, a web browser
based on Firefox:

CVE-2011-2372

   Mariusz Mlynski discovered that websites could open a download
   dialog - which has "open" as the default action -, while a user
   presses the ENTER key.

CVE-2011-2995

   Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary and Jesse Ruderman discovered crashes
   in the rendering engine, which could lead to the execution of
   arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2998

   Mark Kaplan discovered an integer underflow in the javascript
   engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-2999

   Boris Zbarsky discovered that incorrect handling of the
   window.location object could lead to bypasses of the same-origin
   policy.

CVE-2011-3000

   Ian Graham discovered that multiple Location headers might lead to
   CRLF injection.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.0.19-14 of the xulrunner source package. This update also
marks the compromised DigiNotar root certs as revoked rather then
untrusted.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
inversion 3.5.16-10. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

My name is Ian Graham and I’m a Senior Security Engineer working with Citrix Online. Recently, we’ve been doing some research on CRLF injection (HTTP Response Splitting) attacks, and we found a behavior in Firefox that facilitates a specific type of attack.
Consider a web application which is vulnerable to CRLF Injection via an external redirect. In other words, the application is configured to redirect requests for <http://www.vulnerable.com/webmail/>\* to <http://webmail.vulnerable.com/>\*, or something similar. Provided that the application is not correctly filtering CRLF characters, an attacker could create a malicious URI that, upon visiting, would redirect the victim to a website of his choice (in this case, the venerable badgerbadgerbadger.com).
For example, the request:
[http://www.vulnerable.com/webmail/path%0d%0aLocation:%20http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com](http://www.vulnerable.com/webmail/path%0D%0ALocation%3A%20http%3A//www.badgerbadgerbadger.com)
Will yield a response that looks something like:
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: <http://webmail.vulnerable.com/path>
Location: <http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com>
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 156
Date: Thu, 05 May 2011 20:13:07 GMT
The URL has moved <a href="<http://webmail.vulnerable.com/path>
Location: <http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com>">here</a>
And the client will automatically be redirected to <http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com>. This is a pretty standard CRLF injection attack, but the interesting thing here is that it only works on Firefox (Tested on 4.0.1). I’ve tested with various versions of Chrome and IE, and they do not redirect the user to the malicious link.
I’m not super familiar with the internals of Firefox, but I’m guessing that this is because Firefox parses headers in a slightly different way than IE or Chrome (i.e. in the case where there are multiple headers with the same name, IE/Chrome use the first header in the response, while Firefox apparently uses the last).
I don’t know if this particular behavior was intended, or if it’s just a side effect of Firefox’s implementation, and I’m not claiming that this is a Security Vulnerability per se. I just wanted to bring this behavior to the attention of the team, and point out that it facilitates a specific class of attacks.

I thought we did take the first instance of a header. Did we change that along the way or am I misremembering?

It does look like we have code that tries to prevent using a second Location: header (and a few others):
<https://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpHeaderArray.cpp#235>
That should be called while we're parsing the response headers in nsHttpResponseHead.cpp

Boris, I'm not sure if this is what you're after, but here's a fairly easy way to reproduce the issue (This is almost identical to the attack described in one of the original HTTP Response splitting papers at <http://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/general/whitepaper_httpresponse.pdf>):
1. Download and install Tomcat 4.1.24
2. Create a redirect.jsp page in webapps/ROOT that sends a 302 redirect, including a parameter:
<html>
<%
response.sendRedirect("/index.jsp?param=" + request.getParameter("param"));
%>
</html>
3. Using the latest version of Firefox, submit a request for the page you just created, including an HTTP Header injection attack in the parameter:
<http://server:8080/redirect.jsp?param=%0d%0aLocation:%20http://www.badgerbadgerbadger.com>
This will automatically send you to www.badgerbadgerbadger.com.
4. Try the same attack using IE9 or Chrome; it does not work.

That code just makes sure that you can't \_append\_ to the header. Normally headers get merged by concatenating them with commas; for headers like Location that makes no sense.

[Ignore duplicate HTTP headers to avoid CRLF Location: injection.](attachment.cgi?id=536325&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=536325&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=655389&attachment=536325)

> I thought we did take the first instance of a header. Did we change that
> along the way?
Nope--since 2001 SetHeader() has replaced existing values, i.e. used the last header seen:
<http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsblame.cgi?file=mozilla/netwerk/protocol/http/src/nsHttpHeaderArray.cpp&rev=1.16>
I looked at the chrome source, and what they do when duplicate, non-mergeable headers are added is add them as a separate entry in the underlying array. Since their (and our) GetHeader implementation gets the 1st entry found, that means they get ignored by most code (unless it uses visitResponseHeaders, in which case the dupes will show up during the iteration). But they're also available if we want to implement things like "ignore all Content-Disposition headers if multiple are seen with differing values, etc" (which some of the HttpBis stuff may ask us to do).
Alas, we can't just change SetHeader to start adding dupe entries instead of replacing values, because we rely on that behavior in a lot of places. Specifically, nsIHttpChannel::SetResponseHeader() specifically states that passing in 'false' for 'merge' results in replacing any existing value.
So what I've done in this patch is add another parameter to nsHttpHeaderArray::SetHeader, 'noreplace': if a value isn't merged, and noreplace is set, we do the chrome thing and add it as an additional entry. The only place that calls SetHeader with that semantic right now is ParseHeaderLine, which AFAICT is used only when we're reading headers off the 'net (I don't \*think\* it's used when loading from cache, but I could be wrong: but it shouldn't matter?)
Ah, crap--I think I see a problem with keeping dupe headers--in nsHttpResponseHead::UpdateHeaders() we iterate over a list of headers and call SetHeader with their values, in order to replace cache header values. If we keep dupes, we'd wind up having the last header "win" in that case.
I'll change the patch to just drop the 2nd and later headers for incoming network traffic.

P.S. in the long run it'd still be nice to be able to detect whether duplicate headers were sent, but I figure the security hole needs fixing ASAP, hence the quick and dirty "drop" fix.

Attached patch

[Improve xpcshell tests coverage of duplicate headers](attachment.cgi?id=538665&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=538665&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=655389&attachment=538665)

This patch renames test\_double\_content\_length.js to test\_duplicate\_headers.js, and adds more tests for Content-Length as well as adding tests for Location and Content-Disposition (which assumes want to ignore all value when we see conflicting Content-Dispositions, rather than throw an error or pick one).
The most interesting test is probably the one that shows that you can subvert the fix in [bug 597706](/show_bug.cgi?id=597706 "RESOLVED FIXED - Response Smuggling - Dealing with multiple Content-Length Headers") by first passing in a blank Content-Length (which clears the header value), then the "evil" one.
(One of the redirection tests--the one that should succeed, test 7, leaks memory so I've disabled it. Not sure if there's a real bug there or just a bug in my xpcshell code. We have a test that redirects OK w/o leaking--test\_redirect\_passing--so I'm not too worried).
Also adds an e10s wrapper for test, and makes some necko NS\_ERROR constants visible to JS, so xpcshell can test for them.

I'm unconvinced that using the first header field is any better than using the second.
The right thing to do here seems to be similar to what's being done with Content-Length: detect that this is an invalid message, and either drop the whole message or maybe just ignore the Location header field.
(accepting multiple identical header fields seems harmless, but it would be good to know whether it's necessary to be "nice").

Yes, that's correct. In that case Tomcat \*should\* be validating the redirect parameter, and filtering newline characters. 4.1.24 is a fairly old version, and the bug was fixed in a subsequent release

Attached patch

[Fix v1: fix this and some other header bugs](attachment.cgi?id=538712&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=538712&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=655389&attachment=538712)

This patch fixes this bug, closes a flaw in our fix for [bug 597706](/show_bug.cgi?id=597706 "RESOLVED FIXED - Response Smuggling - Dealing with multiple Content-Length Headers"), and also fixes [bug 480100](/show_bug.cgi?id=480100 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Multiple Content-disposition headers cause filename problem").
Basically, this bug just requires that we give that same treatment to Location: as we do to Content-Length in [bug 597706](/show_bug.cgi?id=597706 "RESOLVED FIXED - Response Smuggling - Dealing with multiple Content-Length Headers") (throw error if we see multiple different values). But I noticed some issues with the approach there:
- I wanted to add support for ignoring all values when multiple conflicting values of a header are seen (Content-Disposition in particular, to support [bug 480100](/show_bug.cgi?id=480100 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Multiple Content-disposition headers cause filename problem")--but others may follow?).
- For headers that we do allow to have multiple (non-mergeable) values, I wanted us to take the first value seen (for compat with other browsers).
- I noticed the sneaky "pass empty header to reset" attack mentioned in last comment
- I started thinking that we needed a different API for adding a header from the network, since they have different semantics than other calls to SetHeader. We promise that nsIHttpChannel.SetResponseHeader() will clear or overwrite an existing value, and we also rely on that behavior in nsHttpResponseHead::UpdateHeaders, but that's not at all what we want when adding headers from the net. We really want "merge, noreplace" for network headers, with some added checks for forbidden/ignored dupes. So that's what I've implemented with the new SetHeaderFromNet() function, which is called only by nsHttpHeaderArray::ParseHeaderLine (are there any other places we add headers from the network? I didn't find any).
- I needed to add the idea of "ignored" entries to support 1) ignoring multiple, conflicting Content-Diposition headers and 2) to detect if a blank forbidden header was passed before a value appeared in a later header. The latter is an edge case that's pretty minor, so if we prefer to always keep the first Content-Diposition seen (rather than ignore all values if a different value is later seen), we can rip out all the 'ignored' code. But it's pretty well encapsulated (the only exception is PeekHeaderAt, which implicitly exposes ignored headers by returning NULL for them: but the calls sites already check for NULL, so we're ok).
- I took out the mType field from nsHttpHeaderArray, since I don't think it's needed once the rest of this logic is here.
- I removed the nsHttpHeaderArray::Headers() method I misguidedly added a while ago, and switched HttpChannelParent to use the more standard nsIHttpHeaderVisitor interface (we really should have added in a 'context' that's passed into each call to VisitHeader(): instead I've had to add a kludgy member variable to HttpChannelParent to collect all the headers to send the the child).
I still suspect that in the long run we'll want a data structure that keeps all headers seen, to support Firebug and any other developer plugins that wants to see what actually came in from the network. But that's a more drastic re-write than this.

Right. Another way of putting this is to ask whether we want to add more headers that are in IsSingletonHeader() to either IsSuspectDuplicateHeader() or IgnoreIfConflictingHeader(). I.e. which headers do we want to fail on if there are dupes, which do we want to ignore all values for, and which (if any) do we want to just take the first value of? So far I'm being conservative here--we can land this patch and close the security issue here, then experiment with being stricter about other singleton headers.

Another fine question. I can change the code to make any dupe--even with same
value--have the same effect as a conflicting value.

The more I think about it, the more it seems like ignoring all values for Content-Disposition when there are conflicting ones is a security risk (if you can inject a C-D header as an attacker, you can override the server's directive to treat content as an attachment, and force it to get treated as inline: bad).
So I'm thinking I'll make multiple conflicting values of C-D an error (like content-length), remove all the "ignore" infrastructure here (since C-D was the only header that uses it currently), and assume that we're ok with either barfing on conflicting headers, or are ok taking the first.
Objections?

these tests are significantly bulked up - that's great.. but based on [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=655389#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - CRLF Injection and the parsing of HTTP headers") (which I agree with), I'll drop the r? and wait for the version.. let me know if I misunderstood that.

How does affect throwing an error the page behavior? For C-D I believe the right thing is to ignore the header, but to process the remainder of the message...

Channel is cancelled. For document-level loads, user sees a "Malformed content" error message.
> For C-D I believe the right thing is to ignore the header, but to
> process the remainder of the message
This what I'm asserting is unsafe, since if we ignore all C-D headers when >1 is seen, a CRLF attack can cause the browser to treat content the server specified as "attachment" as "inline" (since inline is the default semantic when no C-D is present).

It's a bit drastic. But I'm certainly not going to argue against draconian error handling :-) Give it a try!

Yes, I heard that but wasn't totally convinced; downloading instead of displaying inline might just different kinds of risks...

You're not. I've mentioned this to Julian before, as he notes. ;)

It shifts risk away from the \_server\_, period. Risk to the user becomes a different sort of risk.

The == tests here are overparenthesized, and the indent on the second line is wrong: it should be indented one more space.
Flatten() needs a mode in which it shows ignored headers too, I think (possibly marking them as ignored?). Or at least the logging in nsHttpTransaction::HandleContentStart needs to be fixed to more accurately log what's going on... Ideally it would log enough for us to tell exactly what happened.
This is still ignoring multiple content-disposition headers. I believe that's not what we want here.
r=me with those issues fixed.

> Flatten() needs a mode in which it shows ignored headers too
As mentioned in [comment 21](/show_bug.cgi?id=655389#c21 "RESOLVED FIXED - CRLF Injection and the parsing of HTTP headers") I've removed all notion of "ignored" headers.
> the logging in nsHttpTransaction::HandleContentStart needs to be fixed
> to more accurately log what's going on.
We're back to where we were: the logging is AFAICT accurate except for 1) we ignore headers with blank values (they don't show up in flattened log); 2) we merge headers as they come in, so Firebug, etc sees the merged header instead of the separate header; and 3) we don't show the 2nd, 3rd, etc values of non-mergeable headers (this is the same as before this patch, except we used to only show the last, now we show the first). I've opened up [bug 669259](/show_bug.cgi?id=669259 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide exact log of HTTP headers for Firebug/LiveHttpHeaders and XHR getResponseHeader") for those issues (though it's not high on my list right now).Summary: CRLF Injection and the parsing of HTTP Location headers → CRLF Injection and the parsing of HTTP headersWhiteboard: [sg:moderate] → [sg:moderate][inbound]

I honestly care less about what Firebug logs than our internal log. We use that all the time for debugging, and having it be inaccurate is a serious pain.
Can we just store all the info in some separate data structure that we use for just that log call but don't expose to necko consumers for now? This is really really important....

Or is the point that we now use the first Content-Disposition we see? If so, that's probably ok for now.

My sincere apologies if what I committed did not meet the intent of your +r.
> we now use the first Content-Disposition we see?
For headers in IsSuspectDuplicateHeader() (including C-Dispo) we now fail if there are conflicting dupes. That was the plan as of [comment 24](/show_bug.cgi?id=655389#c24 "RESOLVED FIXED - CRLF Injection and the parsing of HTTP headers"). For other singleton headers that are not in IsSuspectDuplicateHeader() we now return the first header seen instead of the last.

This patch didn't change our (imperfect) header logging in any way, except that for duplicate, non-suspect singleton headers, we now log the 1st header instead of the last one. Otherwise it has the same flaws it had before (doesn't log blank headers, or show dupes, and shows merged headers instead of what came in on the wire). It seemed/seems like feature creep to try to fix all that in this bug, which is also time sensitive. My apologies for getting it done last-minute in the release cycle, so we didn't have time to discuss that. Anyway, let's move the discussion of how to fix the logging to [bug 669259](/show_bug.cgi?id=669259 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide exact log of HTTP headers for Firebug/LiveHttpHeaders and XHR getResponseHeader"). I have some ideas.

Ah, ok. Could we just log \_that\_ (ideally log the header names and the two values, plus enough info to tie this back to the channel in question)? That would be enough to tell when a load fails because of this issue. A followup bug is fine for this. Or [bug 669259](/show_bug.cgi?id=669259 "RESOLVED FIXED - Provide exact log of HTTP headers for Firebug/LiveHttpHeaders and XHR getResponseHeader"), either way.
For trailers.... do we use them for anything? If not, then it seems like we don't care that much how they're parsed.

Yes, one of the flaws in the new NS\_ERROR\_CORRUPTED\_CONTENT logic is that we're not logging the request fully. Will fix in 669259.

Trailers aren't relevant to message delimitation; no need to worry about them.

Trailers are not used for anything. I have a patch that will use Content-MD5 out of them, but that's it.

I can't provide any details due to confidentiality requirements, but I'm aware of at least one web application server that is exploitable. It's not nearly as widely deployed as Apache or Tomcat, but it is fairly popular, and the vulnerability is present in the latest releases.

OK, here's a 1.9.2 patch. It has the fixes for [bug 597706](/show_bug.cgi?id=597706 "RESOLVED FIXED - Response Smuggling - Dealing with multiple Content-Length Headers") as well (in many ways this was a fixup patch for that bug, so some of it's changes were nullified by this bug, so the combined patch is actually smaller than doing them separately).
I've tested locally (linux64). I tried to push to try, but too much build infrastructure seems to have changed--I think any 1.9.2 push will fail there now. I assume I should just land this and backout as needed.
I don't think this needs review.
Let me know if I should land this--I haven't gotten an answer about whether we're OK incorporating the 597706 changes.

Yikes--our automated build infrastructure seems fragile for 1.9.2 builds. I don't see any actual errors after I pushed, but it's not comforting that many of the builds don't even have logs, so I can't see if oranges are real errors or not:
<https://tbpl.mozilla.org/?tree=Firefox3.6&rev=398ffaf81015>
Let me know if there's anything else for me to do here.

Thanks so much! I'll look into the permared.

And I think we're good from your end, I'll hunt down RelEng.

Can we fix this in a more compatibility-friendly way? Denial of access to the site when they have a duplicated header seems...extreme. Can we poke a hole for when the domain is the same or something similar? I'm very worried about the user impact of this as the error message doesn't give them any indication what is going on and that the problem is server-side.

We only barf at the moment on three headers: Content-Length, Location, and Content-Disposition, and the values differ. I'm not clear on how we could safely display content with different lengths, or a redirect with two different locations--I suppose we could just take the first (or the smallest length? Or hosts that has similar domain?)
Content-Disposition: we could accept multiple headers provided they have the same semantics (i.e. both attachment, or both inline). I wrote a patch for it, but it was badly received by the peanut gallery, err, my esteemed colleagues:
[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=683250](/show_bug.cgi?id=683250 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Permit multiple Content-Disposition header if semantic (attachment vs inline) stays the same")
FWIW we've gotten fairly few complaints about the dupe header issue so far. But then again, we haven't shipped it in a release yet...

s/and the values differ/when the values differ/
I.e we're ok if multiple Content-lengths appear with the same length.

I don't see how any of those things address the security implications, sadly. If we could come up with some kind of a stand-in for safeness (such as the equiv check on content-length) then I'm fine with letting it go by.

It isn't just a duplicated header. It is the website telling us that a critical security-sensitive value has two different values. It is fine to allow exact matches for Location but anything other than is unsafe, AFAICT.
I commented in [bug 681140](/show_bug.cgi?id=681140 "RESOLVED FIXED - josiasdesouza.folha.blog.uol.com.br - Corrupted Content error due to multiple Content-Disposition header field instances, new in Firefox 7") about better documenting this to help website authors fix their code. If we think the error page itself should be reworded, then let's discuss that in [bug 681140](/show_bug.cgi?id=681140 "RESOLVED FIXED - josiasdesouza.folha.blog.uol.com.br - Corrupted Content error due to multiple Content-Disposition header field instances, new in Firefox 7") too.

qa?: is there a minimized testcase QA can use to verify this fix?Whiteboard: [sg:moderate] [landed m-c 7/05] [nom'd by dveditz c#41] → [sg:moderate] [landed m-c 7/05] [nom'd by dveditz c#41][qa?]

netwerk/test/unit/test\_duplicate\_header.js is about as minimized as I can think of, as it part of every xpcshell run we do.

I'm going to call this qa- based on xpcshell coverage.Whiteboard: [sg:moderate] [landed m-c 7/05] [nom'd by dveditz c#41][qa?] → [sg:moderate] [landed m-c 7/05] [nom'd by dveditz c#41][qa-]

fyi - Chromium's William Chan says that Chrome is intending to implement the same restrictions as firefox in chrome 16 or 17. (the chrome bug is security restricted)

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.15-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
