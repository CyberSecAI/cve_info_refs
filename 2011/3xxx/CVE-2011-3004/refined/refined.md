Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3004:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a change in the behavior of the `mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript` function in Firefox 4 and later versions. Specifically, when an `XPCNativeWrapper` object was passed as the `scope` parameter to `loadSubScript()`, the function would "unwrap" it, exposing the underlying object. This was a change in behavior compared to Firefox 3.6 and earlier, where the wrapper was preserved.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** By unwrapping the `XPCNativeWrapper`, the code executed by `loadSubScript` could be directly exposed to the underlying Window object, bypassing the security provided by the wrapper.
- **Exposure to Malicious Content:** This allowed malicious web content to potentially interact with privileged code executed by extensions, leading to possible privilege escalation.
- **Inconsistent Behavior:** The change in behavior between Firefox versions created inconsistencies and unexpected results for developers and add-ons relying on the wrapping mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Malicious web content could inject its own code into privileged calls, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution within the browser or within the extension.
- **Compromised Extensions:** Add-ons relying on the wrapper for security were vulnerable to being compromised by malicious web pages.
- **Loss of Security and Privacy:** The exploitation could undermine the security and privacy guarantees offered by the browser and its extension mechanisms.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Page Exploitation:** A malicious web page could exploit this vulnerability by interacting with an extension using `loadSubScript` and manipulate the unwrapped Window object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to load a web page into a vulnerable browser.
- The attacker needs to target an extension that used `loadSubScript` with an `XPCNativeWrapper` as its scope.
- The attacker needs some knowledge of the target extension code to exploit it effectively.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as a regression introduced during Firefox 4 development.
- The bug report indicates that at least one vulnerable add-on was identified.
- The fix involved preventing chrome code from being compiled if a security wrapper was unwrapped.
- The bug was considered critical and was fixed in Firefox 7, SeaMonkey 2.4, and Firefox 1.9.2.24 branch.
