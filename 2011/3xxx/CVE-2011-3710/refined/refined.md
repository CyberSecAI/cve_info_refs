The provided content discusses a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! and other PHP CMS applications but it is related to CVE-2011-2488, not CVE-2011-3710.

Specifically, the email thread mentions:
- A path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! 1.6.1.
- The vulnerability is also common in many other PHP CMS applications, as referenced by a link to a list of vulnerable paths.
- This is described as a server-side issue, and creating one CVE for each path disclosure issue is not necessary.
- The original request for a CVE was for a different vulnerability in Joomla versions prior to 1.5.23, which was then assigned CVE-2011-2488.

Therefore, the content is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2011-3710.
