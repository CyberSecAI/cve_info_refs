{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The TFIM LTPA STS module support code uses a static instance of a JDK class that is not thread safe.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a non-thread-safe class in a multithreaded environment."
    ],
    "impact": "Undetermined results while verifying or generating the LTPA token signature, potentially leading to authentication or authorization failures. This is more likely to occur in environments with high transaction volume.",
     "attack_vectors": "Concurrent access to the vulnerable code by multiple threads.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to perform any actions other than generating legitimate traffic to the vulnerable system. The vulnerability arises during normal operation with high transaction volume."
