Although Chrome is not directly affected by the attack, the NSS network library was updated to include a defense against so-called BEAST. This defense may expose bugs in Brocade hardware. Brocade is working on the issue. The lighttpd project fixed a compatibility issue at version 1.4.27 and newer.

In addition, we would like to thank Sławomir Błażek and Aki Helin of OUSPG for working with us in the development cycle and preventing bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. Various rewards were issued.
