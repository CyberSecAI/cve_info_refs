How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# vulnerability: rewrite arbitrary user file

Bug #607309 reported by

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: conky

Hi, I've just discovered that conky is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

char \*getSkillname(const char \*file, int skillid)

...

 if (!file\_exists(file)) {

  skilltree = getXmlFromAPI(NULL, NULL, NULL, EVEURL\_SKILLTREE);

  writeSkilltree(skilltree, file);

  free(skilltree);

 }

getXmlFromAPI() can be executed for a long time (e.g. bad connection), so between file\_exists() and write\_file() attacker can create link to any user file named "/tmp/.cesf". Attacker can choose the time when to create the link by watching for network connections.

Thanks.

Thanks for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better.

The latest release of Ubuntu is not vulnerable to symlink race attacks, but earlier releases will need fixing. <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#symlink>

Since the package referred to in this bug is in universe or multiverse, it is community maintained. If you are able, I suggest posting a debdiff for this issue. When a debdiff is available, members of the security team will review it and publish the package. See the following link for more information: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures>

I (as conky dev) added a fix for this in conky's git master branch (<http://git.omp.am/?p=conky.git;a=commitdiff;h=ac4a3682aecb9d6466fea4aebb183b5f8f632905> ).

If you happen to find other bugs in conky in the future, could you also add them to our bugtracker ( <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=143975&atid=757308> ) ?

Thanks !

Garo, as SF seems unresponsible for me I'll comment here. The patch is not full, it is still racy. There is still a period between file\_exists() and fopen(). If conky is Linux only (I don't know) then the fix is a call to fopen() with "x" flag (glibc extension, not portable). Otherwise use open(2) with O\_EXCL flag and either fdopen(3) + fwrite(3) + fclose(3) or write(2)+close(2).

There are parts of conky that are linux-only but that are the parts that do things like examine hardware, the rest should work on everything POSIX-compatible.

There is idd still a period between file\_exists() and fopen() but the only thing that happens in that time is a stat().

I am by no means a security expert so i could be wrong, but i don't see how a attacker could make that stat() hang long enough to create a symlink

The thing is that an attacker shouldn't succeed every time, but he wants to succeed only once (defender's task is never ever allow anybody to do it). He may naively try to create & delete symlink in a loop or do some nontrivial steps to make the system scheduler to stop conky process exactly (ideally for an attacker) between stat and open calls. He may know scheduler heuristics (when it might change the running task) or even try to exploit another vulnerability, e.g. if he gains CAP\_SYS\_NICE then he may controll scheduler's behavior rather well. It's better not to think about the cases, but just safely use temp files (or not even use them at all - it's even better :-)).

Also please look at my patch at <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=612033>, I tried to make it small.

Thanks,

Vasiliy.

Why are you setting the umask ----rw-rw- instead of -rw------- ?

It also seems that the original code (i have no idea who wrote the code for the eve-part of conky) overwrites the tempfile each time but since you are creating unique files this will cause the hard drive to be filled with junk, i think a "unlink(file);" after "doc = xmlReadFile(file, NULL, 0);" should fix this.

I already pushed my version (with the unlink) on the master branch before i saw your version on the debian bugtracker, but it does exactly the same, the only difference is that i'm removing the file inside getSkillname() right after the reading is over and you let getSkillname() finish the parsing of the data it has read.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
Package: conky
Version: 1.8.0-1ubuntu1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole
User: ubuntu-devel@lists.ubuntu.com
Usertags: origin-ubuntu natty

This bug report was also filed in Ubuntu and can be found at
<http://launchpad.net/bugs/607309>
The description, from segooon, follows:

Binary package hint: conky

Hi, I've just discovered that conky is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

char *getSkillname(const char *file, int skillid)
....
	if (!file_exists(file)) {
		skilltree = getXmlFromAPI(NULL, NULL, NULL, EVEURL_SKILLTREE);
		writeSkilltree(skilltree, file);
		free(skilltree);
	}

getXmlFromAPI() can be executed for a long time (e.g. bad connection), so between file_exists() and write_file() attacker can create link to any user file named "/tmp/.cesf". Attacker can choose the time when to create the link by watching for network connections.

Thanks.

What do you guys think of this patch?

I chose not to use mkstemp, because there is no requirement that
mkstemp return a file descriptor that is secure, random, or
unpredictable. mkstemp is only required to provide a filename that is
unique.

I forgot to mention that I don't have an eve account, nor am I very
familiar with the game. So I couldn't test this patch extensively, but
I did test the get_random_tmp_filename() function separate from the
program, and I think everything checks out. The only changes I didn't
test were in the eve() function, and those changes are pretty minimal.
The conky package still builds after this patch.

Someone with an eve account should make sure that everything still
works as expected.

Hi Brandon,

Your patch is not full.  It only tries to create unique filename, but it
cannot guarantee that the file doesn't exist.  The filename shouldn't be
totally unpredictable, but there must be a guarantee that the file
doesn't exists.  mkstemp(3) does it.  Glibc calls open(2) with perms = 0600,
for other systems umask(2) should be called.

Please see the attached patch.  I don't have eve access too, so please
test it who can :-)

Thanks,

Subject: Slightly different version of Segoon's patch
Date: Sat, 12 Feb 2011 12:12:59 +0100
```
I already pushed a patch based on conky-tmp.diff that removes the
temporary file immediately after warning Segoon but before before
noticing that Segoon did the same thing with conky-tmp2.diff .
It's pushed on conky's master branch as commit
70b6f35a846f7b85bd11e66c1f23feee6b369688 .
The only difference between segoon's version and mine is when we call
unlink(). (Segoon does it a bit later)
