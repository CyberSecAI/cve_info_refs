Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-3218:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A cross-site scripting (XSS) issue existed in QuickTime Player's "Save for Web" export feature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The template HTML files generated by the "Save for Web" feature referenced a script file from a non-encrypted origin (HTTP).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker in a privileged network position could inject malicious scripts into the local domain.
- If a user views a template file locally, the injected script could execute in the context of the local domain.

**Attack vectors:**
- A privileged network attacker intercepts the HTTP request for the referenced script file.
- The attacker substitutes the legitimate script with a malicious script.
- The user views a template file generated using the QuickTime Player's "Save for Web" feature.
- The user's browser loads the malicious script into the local domain context

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be in a privileged network position to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack.
- The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the user and the server hosting the script file.
