The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs. The document lists CVE-2011-3452, with the following details:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** After updating to a version of OS X Lion prior to 10.7.3, the Wi-Fi configuration used by Internet Sharing may revert to factory defaults, which disables the WEP password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how the Internet Sharing feature handles Wi-Fi configuration during system updates.

**Impact of exploitation:** A Wi-Fi network created by Internet Sharing may lose security settings after a system update, leaving the network vulnerable to unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by updating the OS X Lion system to a version prior to 10.7.3. After the update, if Internet Sharing is enabled and sharing the connection to Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi configuration will revert to factory defaults.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker doesn't need any specific position or capability; the vulnerability is exploited by the system update itself, not by an external attacker. The attacker would only need to be in range to potentially connect to the exposed Wi-Fi network.

**Additional Details:** The document states that this issue only affects systems with Internet Sharing enabled and sharing the connection to Wi-Fi and that it's addressed by preserving the Wi-Fi configuration during a system update.
