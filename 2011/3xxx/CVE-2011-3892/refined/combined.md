                 CVE-2011-3936 CVE-2011-3940 CVE-2011-3947 CVE-2012-0853
                 CVE-2012-0947

player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the decoders/
demuxers for Westwood Studios VQA, Apple MJPEG-B, Theora, Matroska,
Vorbis, Sony ATRAC3, DV, NSV, files could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

These issues were discovered by Aki Helin, Mateusz Jurczyk, Gynvael
Coldwind, and Michael Niedermayer.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.8-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.
