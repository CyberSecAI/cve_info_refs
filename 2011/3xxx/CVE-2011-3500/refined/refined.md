- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Cogent DataHub software uses a custom web server that is vulnerable to directory traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use backslashes (both ASCII and HTTP encoded) to traverse directories outside the intended web root.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal sequences to the vulnerable server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
