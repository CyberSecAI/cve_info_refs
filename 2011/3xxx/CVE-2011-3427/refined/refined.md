Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-3427:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the acceptance of X.509 certificates signed with the MD5 hash algorithm. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use of a weak cryptographic hash algorithm (MD5) for signing X.509 certificates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Spoofing: An attacker could create X.509 certificates with attacker-controlled values that would be trusted by the system.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks: Exploitation could allow an attacker to intercept and modify communication between the user and a server.
- Information disclosure:  An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information exchanged over X.509-based protocols.

**Attack vectors:**
- A misconfigured certificate authority or further research into MD5 hash collisions could have allowed an attacker to create malicious certificates.
-  A man-in-the-middle attacker could present a malicious certificate signed with MD5 to a user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  Ability to either compromise or gain control of a certificate authority (or the ability to create a rogue certificate authority) to issue a certificate signed with an MD5 hash.
- Ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes except for trusted root certificates.
- The vulnerability affected iOS versions 3.0 through 4.3.5 and Apple TV versions 4.0 through 4.3.
