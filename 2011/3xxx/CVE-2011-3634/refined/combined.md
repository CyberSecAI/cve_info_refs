# USN-1283-1: APT vulnerability

28 November 2011

APT could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [apt](/security/cves?package=apt) - Advanced front-end for dpkg

## Details

It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled the Verify-Host

configuration option. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to steal

repository credentials. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

10.10. ([CVE-2011-3634](/security/CVE-2011-3634))

USN-1215-1 fixed a vulnerability in APT by disabling the apt-key net-update

option. This update re-enables the option with corrected verification.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the apt-key utility incorrectly verified GPG

keys when downloaded via the net-update option. If a remote attacker were

able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be

used to install altered packages.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.7.9ubuntu17.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.7.9ubuntu17.4)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.8.13.2ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.13.2ubuntu4.3)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.8.3ubuntu7.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.3ubuntu7.3)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [0.7.25.3ubuntu9.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.7.25.3ubuntu9.9)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

### Bug Description

Description: Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS

Release: 10.04

Package: apt-transport-https (0.7.25.3ubuntu9.7)

I have enabled Verify-Peer in the https options for apt. The debug reads as follows:

Trying 192.168.234.53... connected

  Connected to 192.168.234.53 (192.168.234.53) port 443 (#0)

 found 149 certificates in /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

 SSL re-using session ID

        server certificate verification OK

        common name: 127.0.0.1 (does not match '192.168.234.53')

        server certificate expiration date OK

        server certificate activation date OK

        certificate public key: RSA

        certificate version: #3

        subject: CN=127.0.0.1

        start date: Fri, 30 Sep 2011 14:55:55 GMT

        expire date: Sun, 29 Sep 2013 14:55:55 GMT

When checking the source I can see, that the following code is executed:

// ... and hostname against cert CN or subjectAltName

   int default\_verify = 2;

   bool verify = \_config->FindB("Acquire::https::Verify-Host",true);

   knob = "Acquire::https::"+remotehost+"::Verify-Host";

   verify = \_config->FindB(knob.c\_str(),verify);

   if (!verify)

      default\_verify = 0;

   curl\_easy\_setopt(curl, CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYHOST, verify);

According to documentation the CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYHOST accepts the values 0, 1 and 2. The value 1 is not recommended, as it flags the non-matching hostname, but does not fail the connection.

The variable "default\_verify" is set to 2 or 0 in the above code, but is not used. Instead the boolean variable "verify" is used in the call to set CURLOPT\_SSL\_VERIFYHOST.

Probably the default\_verify should be used in this call.

As the connection is not failed (but only logged), this might result in an connection to an unwanted host, thus the security vulnerability.

Michael, i have no time yet as i am in the university, but it should be fixed in APT 0.8.11 (rev 2053.1.28 in debian-sid), so more recent ubuntu versions should be fixed, too. Don't know about security implications of that yet, but lets me add that 'debian squeeze' is effected as we ship 0.8.10 in that.

This will need coordination with debian too as squeeze is affected. The diffs will apply cleanly there.

# USN-1283-1: APT vulnerability

28 November 2011

APT could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [apt](/security/cves?package=apt) - Advanced front-end for dpkg

## Details

It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled the Verify-Host

configuration option. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to steal

repository credentials. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and

10.10. ([CVE-2011-3634](/security/CVE-2011-3634))

USN-1215-1 fixed a vulnerability in APT by disabling the apt-key net-update

option. This update re-enables the option with corrected verification.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the apt-key utility incorrectly verified GPG

keys when downloaded via the net-update option. If a remote attacker were

able to perform a machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be

used to install altered packages.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 8.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.7.9ubuntu17.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.7.9ubuntu17.4)

##### Ubuntu 11.04

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.8.13.2ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.13.2ubuntu4.3)

##### Ubuntu 10.10

* [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt)
  -
  [0.8.3ubuntu7.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.8.3ubuntu7.3)

##### Ubuntu 10.04

  -
  [0.7.25.3ubuntu9.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apt/0.7.25.3ubuntu9.9)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
