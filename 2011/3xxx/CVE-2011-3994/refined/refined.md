Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in multiple SKYARC System Co., Ltd. products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF (CWE-352):** The web applications do not sufficiently verify that requests are intentionally made by the user who submitted them. This allows an attacker to potentially trick a user's browser into sending malicious requests to the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   If a logged-in user views a malicious page, an attacker can potentially alter information managed by MTCMS or Movable Type. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of data, settings, or other elements within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is conducted over the network, using HTTP requests.
*   Attackers can embed malicious code within a webpage. When a logged-in user visits this page, their browser will unknowingly send requests to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious page and trick a logged in user into visiting it.
*   The attacker does not need to authenticate.
*   The attacker requires some expertise to craft the malicious requests within a web page.
