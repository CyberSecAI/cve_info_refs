| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c0)  Paolo Bonzini    2011-09-06 13:35:19 UTC  ``` Paolo Bonzini found a buffer overflow in QEMU's SCSI subsystem.  hw/scsi-disk.c tries to zero a user-provided number of bytes in a fixed-size buffer. An unprivileged local guest user can potentially use this flaw to crash the guest.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c1)  Petr Matousek    2011-09-07 09:01:56 UTC  ``` Original 1st comment from Paolo -------------------------------  Description of problem: A buffer overflow is present in QEMU's SCSI subsystem.  hw/scsi-disk.c tries to zero a user-provided number of bytes in a fixed-size buffer.  #define SCSI_DMA_BUF_SIZE    65536 ... typedef struct SCSIRequest {     SCSIDevice *dev;     uint32_t tag;     /* ??? We should probably keep track of whether the data trasfer is        a read or a write.  Currently we rely on the host getting it right.  */     /* Both sector and sector_count are in terms of qemu 512 byte blocks.  */     int64_t sector;     int sector_count;     /* The amount of data in the buffer.  */     int buf_len;     uint8_t dma_buf[SCSI_DMA_BUF_SIZE];     BlockDriverAIOCB *aiocb;     struct SCSIRequest *next; } SCSIRequest; ... int32_t scsi_send_command(SCSIDevice *s, uint32_t tag, uint8_t *buf, int lun) { ...     command = buf[0];     r = scsi_new_request(s, tag);     outbuf = r->dma_buf;     switch (command >> 5) { ...     case 4: ...         len = buf[13] | (buf[12] << 8) | (buf[11] << 16) | (buf[10] << 24);         cmdlen = 16; ...     } ...     case 0x9e:         /* Service Action In subcommands. */         if ((buf[1] & 31) == 0x10) {             DPRINTF("SAI READ CAPACITY(16)\n");             memset(outbuf, 0, len);  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): xen-3.0.3-132.el5 qemu-kvm-0.12.1.2-2.171.el6  How reproducible: 100%  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Under RHEL5 Xen, create a RHEL6 guest that has a SCSI CD-ROM. 2. Install sg3_utils in the guest. 3. Log into the guest from the VNC console as an unprivileged user. 4. Check with getfacl (e.g. "getfacl /dev/sr0" for RHEL5 Xen) that the user got read-write access to the device. 4. Send the following CDB to the device using sg_raw (READ CAPACITY 16, allocation length = 0x040000):       9E 10 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 04 00 00 00 00  Actual results: qemu crashes  Expected results: Either the CDB is rejected with an ILLEGAL REQUEST sense code, or it works successfully  Additional info: The reproduction steps require ConsoleKit for the user to gain access to the CD-ROM devices. For this reason, they do not work when logging in via ssh. Similarly, RHEL5 and earlier guests are not as vulnerable because they do not use ConsoleKit: only privileged users can send CDBs to SCSI devices under RHEL5 and earlier.  The bug is minor because the user cannot control the data that is written to the buffer. Petr Matousek gave it AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C in private IRC discussion.  RHEL5 KVM does not support SCSI devices at all. RHEL6 KVM supports USB disks (which are SCSI), but not USB CD-ROMs. Hence, unless root manually changes permissions or ACLs, the bug cannot be exploited by an unprivileged user.  We may still want to patch it.  Beware of [bug 735993](show_bug.cgi?id=735993 "CLOSED ERRATA - configuring a SCSI cd-rom in an HVM domain messes up IDE drives").  Until it is fixed, in order to create sda as a SCSI CD-ROM you should instead add a dummy *sde* disk like    disk = [ "file:...:hda,w", "file:...:sda,r", "file:...:sde:cdrom,r" ]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c5)  Petr Matousek    2011-09-07 09:56:16 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue only affects qemu as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 xen packages. The versions of the qemu/kvm as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 are not affected.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c6)  Petr Matousek    2011-09-21 15:14:15 UTC  ``` Paolo, could you please post link to the upstream patch?   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c7)  Paolo Bonzini    2011-09-21 16:05:08 UTC  ``` Yes, it just got committed.  A simpler patch is possible, but I prefer to wait:  <https://github.com/bonzini/qemu/commit/103b40f51e4012b3b0ad20f615562a1806d7f49a> <https://github.com/bonzini/qemu/commit/7285477ab11831b1cf56e45878a89170dd06d9b9>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c8)  Paolo Bonzini    2011-09-23 13:20:09 UTC  ``` 5.8 patch posted.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=736038#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-24 17:13:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:1401 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1401.html>   ``` |  |

scsi-disk: lazily allocate bounce buffer

```
It will not be needed for reads and writes if the HBA provides a sglist.
In addition, this lets scsi-disk refuse commands with an excessive
allocation length, as well as limit memory on usual well-behaved guests.

Subject: qemu: CVE-2011-3346

CVE-2011-3346 qemu: local DoS with SCSI CD-ROM

Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat found a buffer overflow in QEMU's SCSI
subsystem. hw/scsi-disk.c tries to zero a user-provided number of
bytes in a fixed-size buffer. An unprivileged local guest user
can potentially use this flaw to crash the guest.
