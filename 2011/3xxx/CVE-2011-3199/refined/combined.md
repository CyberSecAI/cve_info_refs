Subject: Re: CVE request: multiple vulnerabilities in dtc

We are discussing the issues with Philippe Kern. While there are issues
that were discovered, I am claiming that some of what you see below
shouldn't be in the list.

That's not more a security vulnerability than /etc/mysql/debian.cnf
(both file are readable by root only). This has been in the BTS for a
long time, and it makes no sense to assign a CVE now.

That's not relevant and isn't a vulnerability. I have closed the bug a
long time ago, writing that I wont fix it, and explaining why. Please
see the BTS entry for it. dtc-xen isn't supposed to run stand-alone, and
the only client for dtc-xen is dtc itself. If you gain access to it,
then there is an issue somewhere else, and "fixing" things here wont
make things better.

This is fixed in the Git, and has already been discussed. While it's a
serious issue (which has been carefully worked on), it didn't deserve a
CVE 6 months ago, and it shouldn't right now.

The above should be fixed and are real issues, but what I commented
don't deserve a CVE.

Absolutely all of them need a user to be logged indeed.

Ansgar Burchardt, Mike O'Connor and Philipp Kern discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in DTC, a web control panel for admin and accounting
hosting services:

CVE-2011-3195

    A possible shell insertion has been found in the mailing list
    handling.

CVE-2011-3196

    Unix rights for the apache2.conf were set incorrectly (world
    readable).

CVE-2011-3197

    Incorrect input sanitising for the $_SERVER["addrlink"] parameter
    could lead to SQL insertion.

CVE-2011-3198

    DTC was using the -b option of htpasswd, possibly revealing
    password in clear text using ps or reading /proc.

CVE-2011-3199

    A possible HTML/javascript insertion vulnerability has been found
    in the DNS & MX section of the user panel.

This update also fixes several vulnerabilities, for which no CVE ID
has been assigned:

It has been discovered that DTC performs insufficient input sanitising
in the package installer, leading to possible unwanted destination
directory for installed packages if some DTC application packages
are installed (note that these aren't available in Debian main).

DTC was setting-up /etc/sudoers with permissive sudo rights to
chrootuid.

Incorrect input sanitizing in the package installer could lead to
SQL insertion.

A malicious user could enter a specially crafted support ticket
subject leading to an SQL injection in the draw_user_admin.php.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.18-1+lenny2

The stable distribution (squeeze) doesn't include dtc.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.34.1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.

dtc does not escape variables in HTML output in many places.  An example
is the "Domain root TXT record:" field on the "DNS and MX" page where it
is possible to enter values such as

  This is fun."><strong>Isn't it?</strong><input type="hidden

In combination with JavaScript and asking the admin to visit the page
under some pretense this can probably give interesting results.

This must be only in the Lenny version for the tickets, since in my
production servers, I can see HTML tags being escaped.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
