{
  "CVE-2011-3374": {
    "description": "It was found that apt-key in apt, all versions, do not correctly validate gpg keys with the master keyring, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.",
    "root_cause": "apt-key in apt does not properly validate gpg keys against the master keyring.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate GPG key validation",
      "Potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack"
    ],
    "impact": "A MITM attacker can inject malicious keys into the apt keyring, potentially leading to the installation of compromised software packages.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between the user and the server providing the key and needs to generate a valid GPG key that has the same ID as a master key.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability stems from the use of `gpg --list-sigs` instead of `gpg --check-sigs` for verifying keys. Debian's `apt-key` does not enable `net-update`, therefore it is not affected by this specific vulnerability."
