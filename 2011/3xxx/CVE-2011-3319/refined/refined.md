Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3319:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow within the Cisco WebEx Recording Format (WRF) player. Specifically, it's related to how the player parses WRF files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is the presence of multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities within the WRF player. These occur during the processing of WRF files, which could lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable WRF player with the privileges of the user running the player.
*   **Application Crash:** Exploitation could also result in the player application crashing.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious WRF File:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious WRF file that triggers the buffer overflow when opened by the vulnerable player.
*   **Delivery Methods:** Attackers could deliver the malicious WRF files through various methods, including:
    *   Directly sending the file to users (e.g., via email).
    *   Redirecting users to a malicious webpage that contains the WRF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious WRF Files:** The attacker needs the capability to create specially crafted WRF files designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
*   **Delivery of Malicious File:** The attacker needs to find a method to deliver the malicious WRF file to a target user. This could be done by email, social engineering, or by hosting the malicious WRF file on a website.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must open the malicious WRF file with the vulnerable WebEx player.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory specifically mentions that the vulnerabilities affect the Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux versions of the Cisco WebEx WRF players.
*   The advisory provides detailed information on how to determine if a user is running a vulnerable version of the player by checking specific DLL files on Windows, package bundles on Mac, and shared objects on Linux.
*   The advisory specifies the first non-vulnerable versions for the various platforms.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by TippingPoint.
*   The advisory also provides links to snort rules and IPS signatures for detecting the exploitation of this vulnerability.
