How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.121 Safari/535.2
Steps to reproduce:
Hi,
all tests done in <https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/show_bug.cgi?id=16552>.
A vulnerability exists in the upload page bugzilla when a request is made and the value of "token" is not sent to the Bugzilla server, an error occurs allowing XSRF attacker to induce a victim to upload a file in a bug reported, without him knowing.
Actual results:
Upload the file
Expected results:
The file is upload

I don't understand your description. Could you give exact steps to reproduce?

Ah, I see what you mean. A token is not required to upload an attachment. We require one when editing attachments, though, see [bug 476603](/show_bug.cgi?id=476603 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Editing attachments doesn't have any CSRF protection"). This case falls under the same consideration as [bug 703975](/show_bug.cgi?id=703975 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi allows possible unauthorized bug creation"), i.e. an attacker doesn't need you to upload attachments. We protected editing attachments because an attacker could inadvertendly force a power user to remove the private bit of a private attachment. But I guess it's fine to also require a token when uploading a new attachment.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWEver confirmed: true

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=575756&action=edit)

Yes, I think that this vulnerability is a risk "medium". Due to enable the User to upload any file.
Look at this example attack:
1. A victim of confidence of the application programmer, reports a security bug with a POC.
2. The victim opens a specially crafted page by an attacker, which contains a code to upload an EXE file.
3. The comment with the malicious EXE file is downloaded and seen by the programmer
4. The programmer, trusting in victim opens the EXE file, thus possibly
compromising your system.
Reproduce:
1. Create a bug in Bugzilla(<https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/enter_bug.cgi?product=FoodReplicator>)
2. After you create you bug, open the POC attached.
3. Time the ID of you bug created and select the file you want upload.
4. After click in "Submit".

Opps...
Reproduce:
1. Create a bug in Bugzilla(<https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/enter_bug.cgi?product=FoodReplicator>)
2. After you create you bug, open the POC attached.

You have to pass a 3rd argument to redirect the user to a useful page if he get the "suspicious action" page. 'index.cgi' seems a reasonable choice.

Don't bother fixing the indentation here. There are many places where the indentation is wrong in this file. I only bother fixing it when I touch these lines specifically, to not break the history of the file.
Otherwise looks good, but I haven't tested your patch yet. I will test an updated one.

This line should go right after the call to Bugzilla::Attachment->create(). No need to wait for other attachments to be marked as obsolete and the comment written. This token is used for the attachment creation, after all.

You can track progress in [bug 702713](/show_bug.cgi?id=702713 "RESOLVED FIXED - Release Bugzilla 4.2rc1, 4.0.3, 3.6.7 and 3.4.13"). Note that Bugzilla 4.0.3 won't have this fix.

Well, that's embarrassing to me... ;(
But as the "ws:moderate" and how the Mozilla bugs or "ws:critical" as stated here "In the past we have not paid Formally the bug bounty on web vulnerabilities but we have paid for the bounty extraordinary and critical web application vulnerabilities". Just to confirm, this bug and the [bug 703975](/show_bug.cgi?id=703975 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi allows possible unauthorized bug creation") not eligible for a bounty. Right?

That's not my decision, but they are honestly not security bugs, only security enhancements (which is the reason why we didn't backport them to stable branches).

Hi Mario,
There is a team that meets periodically to review submitted bugs and determine if they qualify for the bounty program; once that is done they will update the bug report with the decision.

Mario,
I think you may have received incorrect information somewhere.
The combination of issues listed in this bug and [bug 703975](/show_bug.cgi?id=703975 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi allows possible unauthorized bug creation") have been evaluated and are going to be paid as part of the bug bounty. Chris Hoffman will be contacting you to arrange payment.

# 4.1.3, 4.0.2, 3.6.6, and 3.4.12 Security Advisory

Wednesday, Dec 28th, 2011
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When viewing tabular or graphical reports as well as new charts,
  an XSS vulnerability is possible in debug mode.

* The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method lets you create
  a new user account even if the active authentication method forbids
  users to create an account.

* A CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi and in attachment.cgi could
  lead to the creation of unwanted bug reports and attachments.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    2.17.1 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
Fixed In:    3.4.13, 3.6.7, 4.0.3, 4.2rc1
Description: Tabular and graphical reports, as well as new charts have
             a debug mode which displays raw data as plain text. This
             text is not correctly escaped and a crafted URL could
             use this vulnerability to inject code leading to XSS.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697699
CVE Number:  CVE-2011-3657

Class:       Unauthorized Account Creation
Affected:    2.23.3 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
Fixed In:    3.4.13, 3.6.7, 4.0.3, 4.2rc1
Description: The User.offer_account_by_email WebService method ignores
             the user_can_create_account setting of the authentication
             method and generates an email with a token in it which the
             user can use to create an account. Depending on the
             authentication method being active, this could allow the
             user to log in using this account.
             Installations where the createemailregexp parameter is
             empty are not vulnerable to this issue.

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    2.0 to 3.4.12, 3.5.1 to 3.6.6, 3.7.1 to 4.0.2, 4.1.1 to 4.1.3
Fixed In:    4.2rc1
Description: The creation of bug reports and of attachments is not
             protected by a token and so they can be created without
             the consent of a user if the relevant code is embedded
             in an HTML page and the user visits this page. This
             behavior was intentional to let third-party applications
             submit new bug reports and attachments easily. But as this
             behavior can be abused by a malicious user, it has been
             decided to block submissions with no valid token starting
             from version 4.2rc1. Older branches are not patched to not
             break these third-party applications after the upgrade.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Attached file
[POC.html](attachment.cgi?id=575736) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=575736&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/535.2 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/15.0.874.121 Safari/535.2
Steps to reproduce:
Hello Mozilla Security Team
There is a CSRF vulnerability in the page to send bugs in Bugzilla. When the value "token" is not sent on a "REQUEST" bugzilla does not process correctly, allowing the creation of the bug, with the simple interaction of the User to open a specially crafted page.
Reproduce:
1. Log in Bugzilla
2. Open repro.html
2. See your bug created
Regards,
Mario
Actual results:
The server does not process correctly bugzilla REQUEST and allows for the creation of the exploration bug.
Expected results:
The creation of User BUG without knowing it.

This is so by design. When fixing [bug 26257](/show_bug.cgi?id=26257 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Bugzilla should prevent malicious webpages from making bugzilla users submit changes to bugs."), we estimated that unintentionally filing invalid bugs was much less critical than editing existing bugs, because in this last case, you could forge the URL to make a power user unintentionally remove the group restrictions on a valid security bug. An attacker doesn't need a power user to file invalid bugs. He can create a fake account and spam Bugzilla himself, if that's his goal.
This is still a valid request, but not a security bug, and not something we would take on branches.Group: bugzilla-security

Attached patch

[patch, v1](attachment.cgi?id=575741&action=diff)

I partially reverted what has been implemented in [bug 42946](/show_bug.cgi?id=42946 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugs filed at same time causing one to be duplicated.") to use our standard way to validate tokens. This change also forces a token to be present, meaning that automatic scripts will now have to pass a valid token in order to submit a new bug, or use WebServices, which is fully functional since Bugzilla 4.0.
I also added a missing delete\_token() in process\_bug.cgi when doing mass-change. Else this token could be reused to resubmit changes.Assignee: create-and-change → LpSolit

I'm not sure I'm correctly understanding the comments. Is this a valid issue? If I open the attachment when I'm authenticated will it cause me to file an arbitrary bugzilla bug with my account?

Yes, it's a valid issue; yes, that will cause you to file a bug.

Then this sounds like a valid security issue that should be addressed. If an attacker can use a CSRF issue to force a power user to file a bug of the attacker's choosing this could be used to cause a fair amount of damage.
Frédéric, Can you explain your thoughts that this is not a security issue?

Attached file
[Proof of concept File to reproduce the vulnerability(Using http://landfill.bugzilla.org)](attachment.cgi?id=575938) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=575938&action=edit)

Yes, I think that this vulnerability is a risk "medium". Due to enable the User to upload any file.
Look at this example attack:
1. A victim of confidence of the application programmer, reports a security bug with a POC.
2. The victim opens a specially crafted page by an attacker, which contains a code to upload an EXE file.
3. The comment with the malicious EXE file is downloaded and seen by the programmer
4. The programmer, trusting in victim opens the EXE file, thus possibly
compromising your system.
Reproduce:
1. Create a bug in Bugzilla(<https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/enter_bug.cgi?product=FoodReplicator>)
2. After you create you bug, open the POC attached.
3. Time the ID of you bug created and select the file you want upload.
4. After click in "Submit".

This will still let people click through to file the bug, right? I think that's probably better anyway, for most use cases.

Hmm, I'm concerned that people could try to do a race condition where they use the same token twice. But I suppose if we moved check\_token\_data, then people would get their validation errors before the token error, which would be annoying, wouldn't it?
At the very least, let's delete the token before we write to the database.

Why is this change here? Were we not deleting this token? If so, that seems probably like a bug to backport.

Yes. The user will have the choice between confirming the creation of the bug and canceling the form submission.

Yes, it wouldn't make sense. I'm not too worried about the race condition because once the bug object is created, the token deleted.
> At the very least, let's delete the token before we write to the database.
I can hardly do that, because delete\_token() is called right after Bugzilla::Bug->create(). If there is something wrong with the bug creation and the user has to go back to fill missing data, I don't want the token to be already gone as the 2nd form submission would trigger the "Suspicious Action" warning. Note that this race condition, which would be hard to trigger, already exists with the current code.

Right, we forgot to delete this token during mass-change. I can file a separate bug for it, if you prefer. Just let me know.Flags: approval?Flags: approval4.2?

I guess I asked for further clarification because after reading [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=703975#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSRF vulnerability in post_bug.cgi allows possible unauthorized bug creation") originally I was still confused why you thought this wasn't a security issue. A CSRF vulnerability is definitely a security concern. In terms of risk this is pretty high in my book since it could allow an attacker to force a bugzilla user to submit a bug with the victim's account. When targeting the correct individual this could lead to some pretty significant actions taking place. (E.g. force an admin to submit a bug asking for a firewall rule change or asking to add someone to a particular security group).
It looks like discussion is continuing on how to fix this issue. If that's the case then there's no need to side track on this discussion.
