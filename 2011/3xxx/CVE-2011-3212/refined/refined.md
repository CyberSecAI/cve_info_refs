The provided content contains information about multiple vulnerabilities, and one of them is CVE-2011-3212.

**CVE-2011-3212**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: When FileVault is enabled, approximately 250MB of data at the start of the volume is left unencrypted in an unused area. This occurs because this area is not erased during the encryption process. Only data that existed on the volume before FileVault was enabled remains unencrypted.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Data is left unencrypted on an encrypted volume.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive data can be disclosed if the attacker gains access to the physical disk. The attacker can read the unencrypted data.
*   **Attack vectors**: Physical access to the disk.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Physical access to the hard drive.
