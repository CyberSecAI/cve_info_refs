    "CVE-2011-3658": {
      "summary": "The provided content is related to CVE-2011-3658 and contains detailed vulnerability information.",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds memory access within the Mozilla SVG implementation. The `nsSVGValue::NotifyObservers` function iterates through a list of observers, but doesn't handle cases where the observer removes itself from the list during the notification process. This causes the loop to access memory outside the bounds of the observer list.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Out-of-bounds read/write vulnerability in `nsSVGValue::NotifyObservers`.",
          "Lack of proper bounds checking when accessing the observer list.",
          "Potential for an observer to modify the observer list during iteration."
        ],
        "impact": "Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could control the out-of-bounds memory accessed during iteration, which could be leveraged to redirect the program to attacker-controlled code. It could also lead to a denial of service due to application crash.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "By crafting a malicious SVG document that triggers the vulnerability.",
          "The attacker has to cause an SVG element to be removed during a `DOMAttrModified` event handler, causing observer list to become invalid."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to have a specially crafted SVG document opened by a vulnerable application (Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird) in order to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker must register an observer of nsSVGValue which removes elements from the observer list while being notified, resulting in an out-of-bounds memory access.",
         "additional_details": "The provided information includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrating how to trigger the vulnerability, along with crash reports and details of how the vulnerability is fixed in different versions of Firefox. It also details the root cause in `nsSVGValue::NotifyObservers`, which was fixed by creating a copy of the array before iterating over it. The fix for 1.9.2 branch was a copy, instead of porting the original fix in 602759. The document also mentions the fix was implemented in Firefox 9 and subsequently verified in Firefox 10, 11, and 3.6.28. This information is more detailed than the official CVE description."
