{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of validation for the javascript scheme when loading frame URLs in HTMLPlugInImageElement::allowedToLoadFrameURL. This allows JavaScript code to be executed within the context of the loaded frame.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The primary weakness is the insufficient validation of URLs, particularly concerning the 'javascript:' scheme, within the function responsible for loading frame URLs.",
      "The code fails to check if a JavaScript URL is being loaded into a frame from a different security origin.",
      "The absence of proper Same-Origin Policy (SOP) enforcement allows for cross-origin data leakage."
     ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the Same-Origin Policy and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a different origin. This could be used to steal sensitive information such as cookies and other data, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker can create a malicious web page that loads a cross-origin URL into an object element.",
      "The attacker then changes the object's data attribute to a javascript: URI, allowing JavaScript execution in the context of the initial cross-origin frame.",
      "By utilizing innerHTML, postMessage or other methods, the attacker can extract or transmit the data."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to lure a user into visiting a malicious web page. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim.",
     "additional_details": "The provided blog post offers additional details on the vulnerability including proof of concept code and a description of the fix. The blog post includes multiple proof of concepts, including ones using postMessage and cross-origin POST requests to steal data. The blog post also mentions the vulnerability is present in other browsers such as Maxthon, CM Browser, and Safari 5.0"
