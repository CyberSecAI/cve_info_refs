# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c0)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-21 13:11:06 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the way splitting two extents in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() worked. Althrough ex has been updated in memory, it is not dirtied both in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() and ext4_ext_insert_extent(). The disk layout is corrupted. Then it will meet with a BUG_ON() when writting at the start of that extent again.  Introduced in: 56055d3ae4cc7fa6d2b10885f20269de8a989ed7  Upstream fix: 667eff35a1f56fa74ce98a0c7c29a40adc1ba4e3   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c3)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-21 13:16:14 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 747948](show_bug.cgi?id=747948 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3638 kernel: ext4: ext4_ext_insert_extent() kernel oops [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c4)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-21 13:16:57 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not include support for EXT4 filesystem. It did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it has backported the upstream commit 667eff35 that addressed this issue. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0107.html> and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1530.html>.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c7)  Josh Boyer    2011-10-21 13:23:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c0)) > A flaw was found in the way splitting two extents in > ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() worked.

You are right, it's already fixed.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c9)  Ric Wheeler    2011-10-21 13:27:46 UTC  ``` Are you saying this is fixed in upstream but not in Fedora or RHEL?  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c11)  Petr Matousek    2011-10-21 13:31:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c9)) > Are you saying this is fixed in upstream but not in Fedora or RHEL?  RHEL should be affected.

If Fedora kernels containt the upstream patch in > [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c0), they are not affected.  Right.  It should be fixed in upstream and F15-rawhide, as 667eff35a1f56fa74ce98a0c7c29a40adc1ba4e3 is contained in the 3.0 kernel release.  I'll address F14 in the fedora bug.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 14:26:25 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1530 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1530.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c18)  Vincent Danen    2012-02-09 15:20:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Zheng Liu for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c19)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-09 16:41:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0107 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0107.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-15 00:43:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.1 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:0116 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0116.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=747942#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-04-24 20:18:15 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.6 EUS - Server Only  Via RHSA-2012:0517 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0517.html>   ``` |  |
