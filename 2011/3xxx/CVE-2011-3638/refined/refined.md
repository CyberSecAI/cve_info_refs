  "CVE-2011-3638": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way splitting two extents in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() worked. Although ex has been updated in memory, it is not dirtied both in ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() and ext4_ext_insert_extent(). The disk layout is corrupted. Then it will meet with a BUG_ON() when writing at the start of that extent again.",
    "root_cause": "The ext4 file system code failed to mark changes to the extent in memory as dirty, leading to inconsistencies between the in-memory representation and the on-disk data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Data corruption",
      "Kernel crash"
    ],
    "impact": "Local unprivileged users can use this flaw to crash the system when ext4 filesystem is in use, and potentially corrupt data.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the system using the ext4 filesystem.",
     "required_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user able to interact with the ext4 filesystem."
