| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=808139#c0)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-29 17:07:46 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in libpng's out-of-memory handling in png_set_text2() where it failed to enlarge the info_ptr->text array and didn't restore the prior state correctly, leaving a dangling pointer.  Since this failure was not considered a hard error, if there were more text chunks in the file, control came back again, which led to to writing file-determined data through the dangling pointer.  In order for this to be exploited to be more than a simple crash of the application linked to libpng, the attack would need to be very targeted.  This flaw has been fixed in libpng 1.4.11 [1] which indicated:  Revised png_set_text_2() to avoid potential memory corruption (fixes [CVE-2011-3048](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3048)).  A patch is available in git [2].  [1] <http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/libpng14/1.4.11/> [2] <http://libpng.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libpng/libpng;a=commitdiff;h=78322ccdeb994c311f6175fcefdb5761f85722cb#patch24>  Some applications that ignore text chunks when processing PNG image files are not vulnerable to this because the vulnerable code is not called.  Firefox is one example of such an application that is not vulnerable.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=808139#c1)  Vincent Danen    2012-03-29 17:14:29 UTC  ``` This is also fixed in the following libpng versions: 1.0.59, 1.2.49, 1.4.11, 1.5.10, and 1.6.0beta20   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=808139#c2)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-03 18:09:36 UTC  ``` Created libpng tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 809597](show_bug.cgi?id=809597 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3048 libpng: memory corruption flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=808139#c3)  Vincent Danen    2012-04-03 18:09:39 UTC  ``` Created libpng10 tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 809595](show_bug.cgi?id=809595 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3048 libpng: memory corruption flaw [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 809596](show_bug.cgi?id=809596 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3048 libpng: memory corruption flaw [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=808139#c4)  Fedora Update System    2012-04-08 03:28:28 UTC  ``` libpng10-1.0.59-1.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version

third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a

[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler

severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within

# USN-1417-1: libpng vulnerability

5 April 2012

libpng could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a
specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [libpng](/security/cves?package=libpng) - PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file library

## Details

It was discovered that libpng incorrectly handled certain memory

operations. If a user or automated system using libpng were tricked into

opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause

a denial of service or execute code with the privileges of the user

invoking the program.

### Reduce your security exposure

Libpng 1.5.10 - March 29, 2012
This is a public release of libpng, intended for use in production codes.
Files available for download:
Source files with LF line endings (for Unix/Linux) and with a
"configure" script
libpng-1.5.10.tar.xz (LZMA-compressed, recommended)
libpng-1.5.10.tar.gz
libpng-1.5.10.tar.bz2
Source files with CRLF line endings (for Windows), without the
"configure" script
lpng1510.7z (LZMA-compressed, recommended)
lpng1510.zip
Other information:
libpng-1.5.10-README.txt
libpng-1.5.10-LICENSE.txt
Changes since the last public release (1.5.9):
Removed two useless #ifdef directives from pngread.c and one from pngrutil.c
Always put the CMAKE\_LIBRARY in "lib" (removed special WIN32 case).
Removed empty vstudio/pngstest directory (Clifford Yapp).
Eliminated redundant png\_push\_read\_tEXt|zTXt|iTXt|unknown code from
pngpread.c and use the sequential png\_handle\_tEXt, etc., in pngrutil.c;
now that png\_ptr->buffer is inaccessible to applications, the special
handling is no longer useful.
Fixed bug with png\_handle\_hIST with odd chunk length (Frank Busse).
Added PNG\_SAFE\_LIMITS feature to pnglibconf.dfa and code in pngconf.h
to reset the user limits to safe ones if PNG\_SAFE\_LIMITS is defined.
To enable, use "CPPFLAGS=-DPNG\_SAFE\_LIMITS\_SUPPORTED" on the configure
command or put "#define PNG\_SAFE\_LIMITS\_SUPPORTED" in pnglibconf.h.
Revised the SAFE\_LIMITS feature to be the same as the feature in libpng16.
Added information about the new limits in the manual.
Updated Makefile.in
Removed unused "current\_text" members of png\_struct and the png\_free()
of png\_ptr->current\_text from pngread.c
Fixed PNG\_LIBPNG\_BUILD\_BASE\_TYPE definition.
Fixed CMF optimization of non-IDAT compressed chunks, which was added at
libpng-1.5.4. It sometimes produced too small of a window.
Reject all iCCP chunks after the first, even if the first one is invalid.
Added palette-index checking. Issue a png\_benign\_error() if an invalid
index is found.
Revised example.c to put text strings in a temporary character array
instead of directly assigning string constants to png\_textp members.
This avoids compiler warnings when -Wwrite-strings is enabled.
Prevent PNG\_EXPAND+PNG\_SHIFT doing the shift twice.
Revised png\_set\_text\_2() to avoid potential memory corruption (fixes
CVE-2011-3048).

## Synopsis

Moderate: libpng security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0523)

## Topic

Updated libpng packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

The libpng packages contain a library of functions for creating and
manipulating PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image format files.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libpng processed
tEXt chunks in PNG image files. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted PNG image file that, when opened, could cause an
application using libpng to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-3048)

Users of libpng should upgrade to these updated packages, which correct
this issue. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, they contain a backported
patch. For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, they upgrade libpng to version
1.2.49. All running applications using libpng must be restarted for the
update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2446-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : libpng
Vulnerability  : incorrect memory handling
Problem type   : local(remote)
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3048

It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the png_set_text2()
function of the PNG library could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version libpng_1.2.44-1+squeeze4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your incorrect memory handling packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply

| **libpng** |
| --- |

**libpng** is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost
all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
over 29 years. The home site for development versions (i.e., may be

buggy or subject to change or include experimental features) is [https://libpng.sourceforge.io/](https://libpng.sourceforge.io/index.html), and
the place to go for questions about the library is the [**png-mng-implement**](pngmisc.html#lists) mailing list.

libpng is available as ANSI C (C89) source code and requires **zlib 1.0.4**
or later (**1.2.13** or later recommended for performance and security
reasons). The current public release, **libpng 1.6.45**, includes minor
fixes and improvements:

* Hardened calculations in chroma handling to prevent overflows, and relaxed a constraint in cHRM validation to accomodate the standard ACES AP1 set of color primaries. (Contributed by John Bowler)* Removed the ASM implementation of ARM Neon optimizations and updated the build accordingly. Only the remaining C implementation shall be used from now on, thus ensuring the support of the PAC/BTI security features on ARM64. (Contributed by Ross Burton and John Bowler)* Fixed the pickup of the PNG\_HARDWARE\_OPTIMIZATIONS option in the CMake build on FreeBSD/amd64. This is an important performance fix on this platform.* Applied various fixes and improvements to the CMake build. (Contributed by Eric Riff, Benjamin Buch and Erik Scholz)* Added fuzzing targets for the simplified read API. (Contributed by Mikhail Khachayants)* Fixed a build error involving pngtest.c under a custom config. This was a regression introduced in a code cleanup in libpng-1.6.43. (Contributed by Ben Wagner)* Fixed and improved the config files for AppVeyor CI and Travis CI.

| | **Portability Note** The libpng  1.6.x  series continues the evolution of the libpng API, finally **hiding the contents** of the venerable and hoary **png\_struct** and **png\_info** data structures inside **private (i.e., non-installed) header files**. Instead of direct struct-access, applications should be using the various png\_get\_xxx() and png\_set\_xxx() accessor functions, which have existed for almost as long as libpng itself. libpng 1.8.x is now under development and will eliminate some long-deprecated APIs and "features," potentially breaking compatibility with very old apps. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The portability notice should not come as a particular surprise
to anyone who has added libpng support to an application this millenium; the
manual has warned of it since at least July 2000. (Specifically:
*"Starting with version 2.0.0, both structures are going to be hidden, and
the contents of the structures will only be accessible through the
png\_get/png\_set functions."* OK, so the version number was off a
bit...and the grammar, too, but who's counting?) Those whose apps depend on
the older API need not panic, however (for now); libpng 1.2.x continues to
get security fixes, as has 1.0.x for well over a decade. (Greg no longer
bothers to list either series here; enough's enough, folks. Update those
apps now!)

The 1.5.x and later series also include a new, more thorough test program
(pngvalid.c) and a new pnglibconf.h header file that
tracks what features were enabled or disabled when libpng was built. On
the other hand, they no longer internally include the zlib.h header
file, so applications that formerly depended on png.h to provide
that will now need to include it explicitly.
Complete differences relative to libpng 1.4.x
are detailed [here](src/libpng-1.4.x-to-1.5.x-summary.txt).

See the bottom of this page for warnings about

**security and crash bugs**
in versions up through **libpng 1.6.36**.

In addition to the main library sources,
all of the 1.2.x/1.4.x/1.5.x/1.6.x/1.7.x series include
the [rpng, rpng2 and wpng](book/sources.html) demo programs,
the pngminus demo program, a subset of Willem van Schaik's
[PngSuite test images](http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/),
and Willem's VisualPng demo program.

### Security and Crash Bugs in Older Versions

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.36 and earlier have a use-after-free bug in the simplified libpng API png\_image\_free(). It has been assigned ID [CVE-2019-7317](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7317). The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.37**, released on 15 April 2019. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng version 1.6.31 added png\_handle\_eXIf(), which has a null-pointer-dereference bug as well as a potential memory leak. Insofar as the function has existed for only four weeks and the chunk itself for only six, it's unlikely there are any applications affected by it at this time, but they might come into existence in the future. The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.32**, released on 24 August 2017. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.26, 1.5.27, 1.4.19, 1.2.56, and 1.0.66, respectively, have a null-pointer-dereference bug in png\_set\_text\_2() when an image-editing application adds, removes, and re-adds text chunks to a PNG image. (This bug does *not* affect pure viewers, nor are there any known editors that could trigger it without interactive user input. It has been assigned ID [CVE-2016-10087](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10087).) The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.6.27**, **1.5.28**, **1.4.20**, **1.2.57**, and **1.0.67**, released on 29 December 2016. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all **old-branch** libpng versions through 1.5.25, 1.4.18, 1.2.55, and 1.0.65, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_check\_keyword(), which has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-8540](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8540)). The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.5.26**, **1.4.19**, **1.2.56**, and **1.0.66**, released on 17 December 2015.  The current branch (1.6.x) is *not* vulnerable to this bug. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.19, 1.5.24, 1.4.17, 1.2.54, and 1.0.64, respectively, have a potential pointer overflow/underflow in png\_handle\_sPLT()/png\_handle\_pCAL() (and in png\_handle\_iTXt()/png\_handle\_zTXt() in the pre-1.6 branches), and all such versions likewise have a bug in their png\_set\_PLTE() implementations that left it open to the out-of-bounds write ([CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126)) that was supposed to have been fixed in the previous release. The bugs are fixed in versions **1.6.20**, **1.5.25**, **1.4.18**, **1.2.55**, and **1.0.65**, released on 3 December 2015. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.18, 1.5.23, 1.4.16, 1.2.53, and 1.0.63, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_set\_tIME()/png\_convert\_to\_rfc1123() and an out-of-bounds write in png\_get\_PLTE()/png\_set\_PLTE(). The former vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-7981](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7981) and the latter [CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126). The first is fixed in versions **1.6.19**, **1.5.24**, **1.4.17**, **1.2.54**, and **1.0.64**, released on 12 November 2015; see the subsequent vulnerability warning for info about the latter fix. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.9 through 1.6.15 (and some subset of versions up through 1.5.20) have an integer-overflow vulnerability in png\_combine\_row() when decoding very wide interlaced images, which can allow an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of memory with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-9495](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9495) and is fixed in versions **1.6.16** and **1.5.21**, released on 21 December 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.14, 1.5.19, 1.4.13, 1.2.51, and 1.0.61, respectively, have an out-of-bounds memory access in png\_user\_version\_check(). It is unclear whether this could lead to an actual exploit. The bug is fixed in versions **1.6.15**, **1.5.20**, etc., released on 20 November 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.9 hang when reading images that have zero-length IDAT chunks with the progressive (streaming) reader; a malicious web site could use this bug to cause a (minor) denial of service. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-0333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0333) and is fixed in version **1.6.10**, released 6 March 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.1 through 1.6.7 fail to reject colormapped images with empty palettes, leading to a null-pointer dereference (crash) in png\_do\_expand\_palette(). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2013-6954](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6954) and is fixed in version **1.6.8**, released 19 December 2013. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Various versions of libpng through 1.5.11, 1.4.11, 1.2.49, and 1.0.59, respectively, set the top-level archive-extraction directory's permissions to be world-writable as part of the distcheck Makefile target's operations (configure-generated Makefile only). This could allow a local attacker on the build host to silently replace the extracted libpng library with a malicious version, conceivably poisoning an official binary distribution of libpng (though the likelihood of this seems remote), but more generally allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the user running make. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2012-3386](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3386) and is fixed in version **1.5.12** (and versions **1.4.12**, **1.2.50**, and **1.0.60**, respectively, on the older branches), released 10 July 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All "modern" versions of libpng through 1.5.9, 1.4.10, 1.2.48, and 1.0.58, respectively, fail to correctly handle malloc() failure for text chunks (in png\_set\_text\_2()), which can lead to memory corruption and the possibility of execution of hostile code. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3048](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3048) and is fixed in version **1.5.10** (and versions **1.4.11**, **1.2.49**, and **1.0.59**, respectively, on the older branches), released 29 March 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.5.8, 1.4.8, 1.2.46, and 1.0.56, respectively, fail to correctly validate a heap allocation in png\_decompress\_chunk(), which can lead to a buffer-overrun and the possibility of execution of hostile code on 32-bit systems. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3026](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3026) and is fixed in version **1.5.9** (and versions **1.4.9**, **1.2.47**, and **1.0.57**, respectively, on the older branches), released 18 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 through 1.5.7 contain a one-byte (stack) buffer-overrun bug in png\_formatted\_warning(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) or, conceivably, execution of hostile code. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3464) and is fixed in version **1.5.8**, released 1 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 (only) introduced a divide-by-zero bug in png\_handle\_cHRM(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) in applications that support color correction. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3328](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3328) ([CERT VU#477046](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/477046)) and is fixed in version **1.5.5**, released 22 September 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All released versions of libpng (from 1.0 onward) have a buffer overrun in the code that promotes palette images with transparency (1 channel) to grayscale+alpha images (2 channels), but only for applications that call png\_rgb\_to\_gray() and not png\_set\_expand(). (None are known.) An arbitrary amount of memory may be overwritten in this case, with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2690](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2690).  libpng 1.2.20 and later crashes in png\_default\_error() due to internal use of a NULL pointer instead of the empty string (""). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2691](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2691).  Many (most?) versions of libpng read uninitialized memory when handling empty sCAL chunks, and they handle malformed sCAL chunks (those lacking a delimiting NULL between the internal strings) incorrectly. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2692](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2692).  All of these issues are fixed in version **1.5.4** (as well as **1.4.8**, **1.2.45**, and **1.0.55** on the older branches), released 7 July 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.0 (only) introduced a bug in the RGB-to-grayscale transform code, which can lead to buffer overruns due to incorrect calculation of the number of bytes per pixel. (Since 1.5.0 was just released, no apps or OS distributions are believed to ship with it, so the risk should be minimal.) This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-0408](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0408) ([CERT VU#643140](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/643140)) and is fixed in version **1.5.1**, released 3 February 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Several versions of libpng through 1.4.2 (and through 1.2.43 in the older series) contain a bug whereby progressive applications such as web browsers (or the rpng2 demo app included in libpng) could receive an extra row of image data beyond the height reported in the header, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write to memory (depending on how the application is written) and the possibility of execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2010-1205](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1205) (via Mozilla). An additional memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, is also present; it could lead to an application crash (denial of service) when viewing such images. Both bugs are fixed in versions **1.4.3** and **1.2.44**, released 25 June 2010. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Jeff Phillips reported that several versions of libpng through 1.2.35 contain an uninitialized-memory-read bug that may have security implications. Specifically, 1-bit (2-color) interlaced images whose widths are not divisible by 8 may result in several uninitialized bits at the end of certain rows in certain interlace passes being returned to the user. An application that failed to mask these out-of-bounds pixels might display or process them, albeit presumably with benign results in most cases. This bug may be fixed in version **1.2.36**, released 7 May 2009, but the correct fix is in version **1.2.37**, released 4 June 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 0.89c through 1.2.34 contain an uninitialized-data bug that can be triggered by a malicious user. Specifically, there are several instances in which a malloc'd array of pointers is then initialized by a secondary sequence of malloc() calls. If one of these calls fails, libpng's cleanup routine will attempt to free the entire array, including any uninitialized pointers, which could lead to execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2009-0040](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0040) and is fixed in version **1.2.35**, released 18 February 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.30 and 1.2.31 of libpng can crash when reading images with multiple zTXt chunks; it is likely that this vulnerability could lead to a remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-3964](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3964) and is fixed in version **1.2.32**, released 18 September 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.2.26 have a bug when handling unknown (to libpng) chunks with zero data length. Applications that call either png\_set\_read\_user\_chunk\_fn() or png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks(), when used with standard builds of libpng (i.e., built with either PNG\_READ\_UNKNOWN\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED or PNG\_READ\_USER\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED defined), can crash when attempting to free a non-existent data buffer for the unknown chunk. The **pngtest** sample application distributed with libpng, **pngcrush**, and certain versions of **ImageMagick** are known to be affected, but the bug is otherwise believed to be quite rare. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-1382](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1382) and is fixed in version **1.2.27**, released 28 April 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Crash Warning** Most versions of libpng up through 1.2.24 have a number of minor coding errors that could lead to crashes in exceptional cases. For example, if memory allocation fails while processing certain ancillary chunks, libpng could crash while attempting to write to the NULL pointer; or if the application author failed to set up the info\_ptr as required, some parts of libpng fail to check for NULL and could crash trying to read the pointer (though it's probable that the error would have caused libpng to terminate upstream of these parts). The bugs are fixed in version **1.2.25**, released 18 February 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Version 1.2.21 has a crash bug when reading the ICC-profile chunk, iCCP ([CVE-2007-5267](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5267)). This bug is fixed in version **1.2.22**, released 13 October 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.20 and earlier have a number of potential crash-bugs due to out-of-bounds reads in certain chunk-handlers; MITRE has collectively assigned them the identifiers [CVE-2007-5266](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5266), [CVE-2007-5268](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5268) and [CVE-2007-5269](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5269). These bugs are fixed in version **1.2.21**, released 4 October 2007, but another crash bug (related to the ICC-profile chunk) remains to be fixed in version **1.2.22**. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.16 (and 1.0.24) have an NULL-pointer-dereference vulnerability involving palette images with a malformed tRNS chunk (i.e., one with a bad CRC value). This bug can, at a minimum, cause crashes in browsers simply by visiting a page displaying such an image; reportedly it also crashes the Microsoft Windows display manager. CERT refers to it as [VU#684664](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684664) and MITRE as [CVE-2007-2445](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2445). It's fixed in versions **libpng 1.2.18** and **libpng 1.0.26** (also **1.2.17** and **1.0.25**, which had a bug in their configure scripts), released 15 May 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.0.6 through 1.2.12 and 1.0.20 have a bug in the decoder for the sPLT ("suggested palette") chunk; this can lead to crashes and, accordingly, a denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). The bug is fixed in **libpng 1.2.13** and **libpng 1.0.21**, released 15 November 2006. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-5793](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5793). The same releases also include fixes for a specific class of application error (NULL png\_ptr) and for a bug in the code that *writes* the iCCP ("ICC profile") chunk. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 have a buffer-overrun vulnerability when a particular error message is triggered. The overrun is always by exactly two bytes ('k' and NULL) so it seems highly unlikely that it could be used for anything more nefarious than denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). Nevertheless, it's worth fixing, and versions **libpng 1.2.12** and **libpng 1.0.20**, released 27 June 2006, do just that. (Note that 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 erroneously claimed to include the fix, but in fact it had been inadvertently omitted.) MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-3334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3334). The same releases (and their immediate predecessors) also fix an out-of-bounds (by one) memory read and a second buffer overrun, this one in the code that *writes* the sCAL ("physical scale of subject") chunk (which is rather rare in any case). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

There have been other issues in older versions released in 2004:

| | **Crash Warning** Versions 1.2.7, 1.2.6, 1.0.17, and 1.0.16 have a bug that will cause applications that strip the alpha channel (while reading a PNG) to crash. The bug is fixed in versions **1.2.8** and **1.0.18**, which were released on 3 December 2004. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-0481](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0481). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The release before that fixed another bug, this one in the PNG-writing code:

| | **Broken-Image Warning** Versions 1.2.6 and 1.0.16 can write an invalid zlib header within the PNG datastream. This is not quite as bad as it sounds since the two-byte header can be corrected fairly easily (e.g., use [pngcrush](http://pmt.sf.net/pngcrush/) to rewrite the images and, perhaps, compress them slightly better, or run the *png-fix-IDAT-windowsize* utility bundled with [pngcheck](apps/pngcheck.html) 2.1.0 or later), but some applications will display the images incorrectly. Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer are known to be affected. A [libpng patch](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.2.6-patch-pngwutil.txt) is available, and versions **1.2.7** and **1.0.17** (incorporating the fix) were released on 11 September 2004. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

Finally--and most important--there were several security vulnerabilities
present in versions of libpng prior to 1.2.6 and 1.0.16, one of which is
**quite dangerous**:

| | **Vulnerability Warning** On 4 August 2004 a new **jumbo security patch** was released to address several potential vulnerabilities in libpng, at least one of which is *quite serious*. It was followed on 15 August by the full **libpng 1.2.6** and **libpng 1.0.16** releases, which, like subsequent releases, incorporate the fix. All users are strongly urged to upgrade to the latest release of libpng or to patch any affected applications as soon as possible. *(Graphical browsers and e-mail clients are particularly at risk.)* Get the latest releases or an appropriate combo patch either from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624) (headings [1.2.5-security-patches](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683&release_id=257244) and [1.2.5and-older-sec-patchs](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683&release_id=258110)) or from Oregon State's Open Source Lab. Here's the [CERT advisory](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA04-217A.html), along with the relevant CERT and MITRE vulnerability pages:  * **CERT [VU#388984](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/388984)**   (CVE [CAN-2004-0597](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0597))   (this is the **serious** one!)* CERT [VU#160448](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/160448)     (CVE [CAN-2004-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0599))* CERT [VU#236656](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/236656)       (CVE [CAN-2004-0598](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0598))* CERT [VU#286464](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/286464)         (CVE [CAN-2004-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0599))* CERT [VU#477512](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/477512)           (CVE [CAN-2004-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0599))* CERT [VU#817368](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/817368)             (CVE [CAN-2004-0597](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0597))   These vulnerabilities were discovered by Chris Evans and are also described in [his alert](http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2004-001.txt).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# libpng: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libpng might allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.10**>= **1.2.49** |

### Background

libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) images. It is used by several programs, including web browsers
and potentially server processes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng:

* The “embedded\_profile\_len()” function in pngwutil.c does not
  check for negative values, resulting in a memory leak (CVE-2009-5063).
* The “png\_format\_buffer()” function in pngerror.c contains an
  off-by-one error (CVE-2011-2501).
* The “png\_rgb\_to\_gray()” function in pngrtran.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2011-2690).
* The “png\_err()” function in pngerror.c contains a NULL pointer
  dereference error (CVE-2011-2691).
* The “png\_handle\_sCAL()” function in pngrutil.c improperly handles
  malformed sCAL chunks(CVE-2011-2692).
* The “png\_decompress\_chunk()” function in pngrutil.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2011-3026).
* The “png\_inflate()” function in pngrutil.c contains and out of
  bounds error (CVE-2011-3045).
* The “png\_set\_text\_2()” function in pngset.c contains an error
  which could result in memory corruption (CVE-2011-3048).
* The “png\_formatted\_warning()” function in pngerror.c contains an
  off-by-one error (CVE-2011-3464).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running the vulnerable program,
which could be the root user, or to cause programs linked against the
library to crash.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.5.10"

```

All libpng 1.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.49"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
