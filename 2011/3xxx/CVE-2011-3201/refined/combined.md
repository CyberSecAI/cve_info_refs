| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c0)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-25 20:10:09 UTC  ``` This is another Evolution security issue that I found upstream but presume also affects Fedora and would like to put on the Fedora security team's radar.  If my filing such bugs is not appreciated, please let me know and I will stop.  Description of problem: Evolution registers a "mailto:" URL handler that accepts a parameter to attach a local file.  Thus, a web site can launch the composer on an email with a confidential file attached and try to trick the user into sending it.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): Upstream gnome-3-0 branch as of 2011-08-24  How reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to <https://mattmccutchen.net/private/evolution-mailto-test> . 2. Click "Send" in the composer.  Actual results: Your SSH private key is emailed to me.  Expected results: A prompt is shown and you decline to attach the private key.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c1)  Sara Cavallari    2011-08-26 09:00:22 UTC  ``` I wonder why this functionality exists at all. IMHO the right thing to do is to ignore the "attach" parameter, I can't figure out any use case for that.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c2)  Matthew Barnes    2011-08-26 12:47:11 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 520081](attachment.cgi?id=520081 "Composer screenshot") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=520081&action=edit "Composer screenshot") Composer screenshot  Nautilus SendTo relies on it.  The exploit is pretty lame in my opinion, since it requires two human errors.  The first is not noticing the suspicious looking ?attach= parameter in the URL, which I can kind of forgive, especially when it's hidden behind innocent looking HTML text.  Similar to phishing schemes.  But the second required human error is not noticing the big attachment icon at the bottom of the composer window while composing the message.  That strikes me as pretty far fetched.  (see attached screenshot)   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c3)  Josh Bressers    2011-08-26 13:31:57 UTC  ``` I'd call this exploit above lame. Most people don't pay attention to this sort of thing. Granted, those same folks are unlikely to have ssh keys :) But it's still something we should fix.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c4)  Josh Bressers    2011-08-26 13:47:30 UTC  ``` Err, not lame. Sorry.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c5)  Josh Bressers    2011-08-26 13:55:43 UTC  ``` This goes all the way back to RHEL4. I'm going to move this bug to the security response product so we can begin proper tracking.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c6)  Matthew Barnes    2011-08-26 14:48:06 UTC  ``` The ?attach= parameter should be stripped out by the application spawning the mailto: URL handler, not the application receiving the mailto: URL.  There's valid use cases for an ?attach= parameter, as I pointed out above with Nautilus SendTo, which is why nearly all mail clients support it.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c7)  Sara Cavallari    2011-08-26 14:56:10 UTC  ``` > The ?attach= parameter should be stripped out by the application spawning the mailto:  I'm not sure about that. mailto: is a standard URI, and it should be quite safe to use. If some applications decided to extend the standard and do something not security sensible, it's their fault.  Browsers should not need to know anything about a (non-internal) URI scheme, beside allowing it or not, and what client to use.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c8)  Matthew Barnes    2011-08-26 16:46:36 UTC  ``` Claws Mail has a good solution for this.  It too handles "attach" parameters in mailto URLs, but it checks the file name against a blacklist which includes:     ".gnupg/"    "/etc/passwd"    "/etc/shadow"    ".ssh/"    "../"  I think this would be a reasonable compromise for Evolution.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c9)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-26 18:06:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c6)) > The ?attach= parameter should be stripped out by the application spawning the > mailto: URL handler, not the application receiving the mailto: URL.  There's > valid use cases for an ?attach= parameter, as I pointed out above with Nautilus > SendTo, which is why nearly all mail clients support it.  Quoting <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c3> :  After the URL handler security model has been ambiguous for so long, assuming the URLs to be trustworthy or sanitized and obliging all callers to comply is unrealistic.  (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c8)) > Claws Mail has a good solution for this.  It too handles "attach" parameters in > mailto URLs, but it checks the file name against a blacklist which includes: >  >    ".gnupg/" >    "/etc/passwd" >    "/etc/shadow" >    ".ssh/" >    "../"  Such a list is never going to be complete, so it's hardly a solution.  ".fedora.cert" anyone?  The more interesting point is that Claws Mail has a remote command interface which is unrestricted.  That is the solution for Nautilus "Send To".   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c10)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-26 18:12:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c2)) > The exploit is pretty lame in my opinion, since it requires two human errors.  > The first is not noticing the suspicious looking ?attach= parameter in the URL, > which I can kind of forgive, especially when it's hidden behind innocent > looking HTML text.  Or an HTTP redirect, as in my demo.  There is nothing for the user to notice, he/she just has to be willing to visit your web site (same assumption as in most XSS/XSRF attacks).   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c12)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-11-25 15:49:49 UTC  ``` Created evolution tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 757164](show_bug.cgi?id=757164 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2011-3201 evolution: mailto: attachment parameter can lead to accidental data exfiltration [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c14)  Murray McAllister    2011-12-14 02:41:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Matt McCutchen for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 10:21:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0516 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0516.html>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c18)  Huzaifa S.

It too handles "attach" parameters in mailto URLs, but it checks the file name against a blacklist which includes:     ".gnupg/"    "/etc/passwd"    "/etc/shadow"    ".ssh/"    "../"  I think this would be a reasonable compromise for Evolution.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c9)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-26 18:06:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c6)) > The ?attach= parameter should be stripped out by the application spawning the > mailto: URL handler, not the application receiving the mailto: URL.

Quoting <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c3> :  After the URL handler security model has been ambiguous for so long, assuming the URLs to be trustworthy or sanitized and obliging all callers to comply is unrealistic.

".fedora.cert" anyone?  The more interesting point is that Claws Mail has a remote command interface which is unrestricted.  That is the solution for Nautilus "Send To".   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c10)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-26 18:12:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=733504#c2)) > The exploit is pretty lame in my opinion, since it requires two human errors.  > The first is not noticing the suspicious looking ?attach= parameter in the URL, > which I can kind of forgive, especially when it's hidden behind innocent > looking HTML text.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Topic

Updated evolution packages that fix one security issue and three bugs are
now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Evolution is the GNOME mailer, calendar, contact manager and communication
tool. The components which make up Evolution are tightly integrated with
one another and act as a seamless personal information-management tool.

The way Evolution handled mailto URLs allowed any file to be attached to
the new message. This could lead to information disclosure if the user did
not notice the attached file before sending the message. With this update,
mailto URLs cannot be used to attach certain files, such as hidden files or
files in hidden directories, files in the /etc/ directory, or files
specified using a path containing "..". (CVE-2011-3201)

Red Hat would like to thank Matt McCutchen for reporting this issue.

This update also fixes the following bugs:

* Creating a contact list with contact names encoded in UTF-8 caused these

names to be displayed in the contact list editor in the ASCII encoding
instead of UTF-8. This bug has been fixed and the contact list editor now
displays the names in the correct format. (BZ#707526)

* Due to a bug in the evolution-alarm-notify process, calendar appointment

alarms did not appear in some types of calendars. The underlying source
code has been modified and calendar notifications work as expected.
(BZ#805239)

* An attempt to print a calendar month view as a PDF file caused Evolution

to terminate unexpectedly. This update applies a patch to fix this bug and
Evolution no longer crashes in this situation. (BZ#890642)

All evolution users are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. All running instances
of Evolution must be restarted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c0)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-25 20:00:02 UTC  ``` By registering a mailto: URL handler that allows local files to be attached via a query parameter, you are letting arbitrary web sites place the user one unsuspecting click away from exfiltrating confidential data.  E.g.:  <https://mattmccutchen.net/private/evolution-mailto-test>  I'm not sure if the security model for URL handlers has been decided in general, but given that browsers currently allow untrusted sites to call the mailto: handler, it needs to have appropriate safeguards.  I would suggest showing a prompt with a checkbox, initially off, for each attachment specified in the URL. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c1)  Matthew Barnes    2011-08-25 20:42:39 UTC  ``` I think this needs to be handled by web browsers.  Nautilus SendTo, for example, invokes Evolution with a mailto: URL and I don't want to get prompted with a scary warning about attaching a file that I just told Nautilus to attach to an email. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c2)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-25 20:43:42 UTC  ``` Oh... I didn't anticipate that you would want this private and already filed a public Fedora bug (<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=733504>), which I cannot now make private. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c3)  Matt McCutchen    2011-08-25 20:59:01 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c1)) > I think this needs to be handled by web browsers.  I think you mean all applications that present untrusted links, which also includes IM clients and HTML mail readers such as Evolution.  So your suggestion would not get you out of changing Evolution.  After the URL handler security model has been ambiguous for so long, assuming the URLs to be trustworthy or sanitized and obliging all callers to comply is unrealistic, especially with respect to an Evolution-specific query parameter.  > Nautilus SendTo, for > example, invokes Evolution with a mailto: URL and I don't want to get prompted > with a scary warning about attaching a file that I just told Nautilus to attach > to an email.  So we introduce a different API for that.  At any rate, it is a lesser evil than this bug. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c4)  Vincent Untz    2011-09-06 16:02:58 UTC  ``` Since the Red Hat bug is public and cannot be made private, is it okay to make this bug public too? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c5)  Matthew Barnes    2011-09-06 16:23:12 UTC  ``` Bug is public now. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c6)  Vibha Yadav    2011-09-13 13:06:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 196367](attachment.cgi?id=196367 "Patch for Evolution") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=196367&action=edit "Patch for Evolution") [[review]](review?bug=657374&attachment=196367) Patch for Evolution  Added the code for providing the warning in if mailto command is trying to attach any blacklisted file.  The blacklist is currently:  - hidden files (e.g. ".foo"). - files in hidden directories (e.g. ".secret/foo"). - files under /etc. - files with ".." as a path component. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c7)  Vibha Yadav    2011-09-13 13:16:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 196368](attachment.cgi?id=196368 "Patch for Evolution") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=196368&action=edit "Patch for Evolution") [[review]](review?bug=657374&attachment=196368) Patch for Evolution  Patch for corporate releases. Here instead of providing a warning in composer window. Blocking the blacklisted file from getting attached and providing a warning on terminal.  Backported to 2.28 ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c8)  Matthew Barnes    2011-09-13 14:59:56 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 196367](attachment.cgi?id=196367 "Patch for Evolution") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=196367&action=edit "Patch for Evolution") [[review]](review?bug=657374&attachment=196367):  A simple substring search against the blacklist is too simplistic.  You're going to exclude perfectly safe filenames like "README.txt" ('.' rule).  The filename needs to be broken into path components using     g_strsplit (filename, G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S, -1)  and then compare each path component against the blacklist using prefix match (g_str_has_prefix()) instead of a substring match.  Also I think the wording of the alert could be improved.  Perhaps something like:     The mailto: URL included a suspicious looking attachment     A suspicious looking file named "$FILENAME" was removed as a precaution.    You can reattach this file using the "Add Attachment" button below. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c9)  Matthew Barnes    2011-09-13 15:05:38 UTC  ``` Review of [attachment 196368](attachment.cgi?id=196368 "Patch for Evolution") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=196368&action=edit "Patch for Evolution") [[review]](review?bug=657374&attachment=196368):  Same issue here with the blacklist comparison.  You're correct to just use a terminal message here to avoid new translatable strings. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c10)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2011-09-13 15:24:02 UTC  ``` Why blacklist at all? Can't I get always in case that the &attachment parameter was passed (in case this can be identified and that the filename[s] can be extracted) a popup telling me that $filename was automatically attached and that I should make sure that I really want to send this file? ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c11)  Matthew Barnes    2011-09-13 15:56:54 UTC  ``` Such a dialog would be annoying and redundant if the attachment was submitted intentionally by way of Nautilus-Sendto or even a command-line or shell script invocation. ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c12)  Matt McCutchen    2011-09-13 19:01:08 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=657374#c11)) > Such a dialog would be annoying and redundant if the attachment was submitted > intentionally by way of Nautilus-Sendto or even a command-line or shell script > invocation.

I have plenty of confidential files at paths that have no hidden component and contain no randomness; it's too strong an assumption that such paths will never be guessed or accidentally leaked by an application or in a log posted to a bug report, etc.  Attachments specified by untrusted mailto URLs should not be honored without explicit user consent.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=805239#c0)  David Jaša    2012-03-20 17:25:34 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Notifications don't work for CalDAV calendars. They do work for local calendar  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): evolution-2.28.3-24.el6.x86_64  How reproducible: always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. make sure that "Display alarms in notification area only" checkbox in Edit -> Preferences -> Calendar & Tasks -> Alarms is checked and also all calendars are checked 2. create an event with alarm in CalDAV calendar 3. wait for time when alarm should trigger    Actual results: alarm is not triggered  Expected results: alarm should be triggered  Additional info: for local calendar, alarm works  RHEL 5 bug: [bug 473044](show_bug.cgi?id=473044 "CLOSED WONTFIX - Calendars: alarm notification doesn't work")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=805239#c1)  Milan Crha    2012-03-21 10:41:53 UTC  ``` We spoke a bit about this on IRC and there is a problem with authenticated calendars. There was a bug about the same with Exchange calendars, and if I recall correctly then the resolution was to store calendar password, thus the evolution-alarm-notify process have it ready when needed (the process doesn't ask users for passwords, it's new in 3.3.x). David told me he does save passwords for his CalDAV calendar, thus this is about something else.  The other possibility, I can think of right now, is network unavailability. I suppose David's calendar is on VPN, and when the evolution-alarm-notify process is run on session start, then the VPN connection is not established yet, thus the process gets rid of the calendar and doesn't try to reconnect later. Restart of evolution-alarm-notify may prove the hypothesis, though when David tried then it didn't work for him either, he didn't receive any reminders from his CalDAV calendar.  I'll investigate this later, and let you know what I found through this bug report.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=805239#c2)  Milan Crha    2012-04-05 17:17:26 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 575500](attachment.cgi?id=575500&action=diff "evo patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=575500&action=edit "evo patch") evo patch  for evolution;  OK, after some investigation it turned out that the evolution-alarm-notify process uses wrong password component. While the calendar view uses either "auth-domain" property of the ESource (which is usually set on Groupware sources, like exchange), or the predefined "Calendar" component, the evolution-alarm-notify fallbacks to ESource's name instead, thus it cannot find password (it is requested to store passwords, otherwise alarm notification doesn't work), and thus the authentication fails and no alarms are shown.  I'm currently building a test package for you, thus if you could test it, then it'll be appreciated. <https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/taskinfo?taskID=4266335>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=805239#c3)  David Jaša    2012-04-06 11:02:58 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=805239#c2)) >  > I'm currently building a test package for you, thus if you could test it, then > it'll be appreciated. <https://brewweb.devel.redhat.com/taskinfo?taskID=4266335>  The build indeed fixes the problem, thanks!   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=805239#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-02-21 10:21:12 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.
