  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2011-3201",
    "description": "Evolution registers a \"mailto:\" URL handler that accepts a parameter to attach a local file. Thus, a web site can launch the composer on an email with a confidential file attached and try to trick the user into sending it.",
    "affected_component": "Evolution mail client",
    "root_cause": "Improper input validation of the 'attach' parameter in mailto: URLs.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "The Evolution mail client allows local files to be attached via a query parameter in mailto: URLs.",
      "The application doesn't properly sanitize or check the attachment path, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary files."
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially trick a user into sending a confidential file as an attachment in an email, without their explicit consent.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious web site can craft a mailto: URL with an 'attach' parameter pointing to a sensitive file on the user's system.",
      "Clicking the malicious link will open the Evolution composer with the specified file attached."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to lure a user to click on a malicious link, typically embedded in a website or an email.",
    "additional_details": [
      "The vulnerability exists because Evolution directly uses the 'attach' parameter from the mailto: URL without proper sanitization.",
      "The mailto: URL handler accepts the parameter to attach a local file.",
        "A blacklist approach was implemented that checks for hidden files, files in hidden directories, files in /etc, and files with '..' in the path to mitigate the issue but it was not deemed a complete solution"
    ],
    "remediation": "The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a blacklist to prevent certain types of file attachments. Additionally a patch was applied to correctly handle the 'attach' parameter, preventing unauthorized file attachments. A security update was issued that included backported patches to correct the security issue."
