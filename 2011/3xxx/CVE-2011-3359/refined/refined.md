Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient buffer allocation in the `b43` wireless driver when processing incoming network frames. Specifically, the receive buffers were not large enough to accommodate the maximum frame size plus an offset. This could cause a buffer overflow when the driver tried to write data to the `sk_buff` structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient buffer allocation:** The driver allocated receive buffers of size `IEEE80211_MAX_FRAME_LEN`, which was not sufficient to accommodate the frame and required offset.
- **Potential for `skb_put` failure:** The `skb_put` function, used to add data to a socket buffer, could fail if there was insufficient space available, leading to a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **System crash/kernel panic:** An attacker could send crafted network frames to a vulnerable system, triggering the insufficient buffer allocation and subsequent `skb_put` failure, leading to a kernel panic and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending malicious wireless frames to a system with a vulnerable Broadcom 43xx wireless adapter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send wireless network frames to the targeted system, which implies being within the range of the wireless network.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable driver:** The attacker needs to know that the target system is using a vulnerable version of the `b43` driver.

**Technical Details:**
- The bugzilla entry for the kernel bug [32042](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32042) shows a kernel panic with the following stack trace:
```
[192500.881342] skb_over_panic: text:f80fc27d len:2378 put:2378 head:cfbf0000 data:cfbf0040 tail:0xcfbf098a end:0xcfbf0980 dev:<NULL>

```
This stack trace indicates a crash within the `skb_put` function, which is used to append data to a socket buffer. This is triggered by `b43_dma_rx` function
- The fix involves allocating the receive buffers with a size of `B43_DMA0_RX_BUFFERSIZE` which is defined as `(B43_DMA0_RX_FRAMEOFFSET + IEEE80211_MAX_FRAME_LEN)` as shown in the patch on github. [c85ce65ecac078ab1a1835c87c4a6319cf74660a](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c85ce65ecac078ab1a1835c87c4a6319cf74660a)
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry [738202](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738202) and the oss-security mailing list confirm the vulnerability and the assigned CVE ID. It also mentions that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 are not affected as they did not support the Broadcom 43xx wireless devices, while RHEL 6 and MRG are affected.

In summary, CVE-2011-3359 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Linux kernel's `b43` driver caused by insufficient buffer allocation for receiving wireless frames, which can be exploited by a network attacker.
