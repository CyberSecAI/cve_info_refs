# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1465.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=738202#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-10-25 04:05:40 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 748688](show_bug.cgi?id=748688 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-3359 kernel: b43: allocate receive buffers big enough for max frame len + offset [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=738202#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-11-22 16:50:57 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1465 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1465.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=738202#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-01-10 20:16:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-6 v.2  Via RHSA-2012:0010 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0010.html>   ``` |  |
