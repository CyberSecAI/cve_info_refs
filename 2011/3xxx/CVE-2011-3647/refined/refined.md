Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `loadSubScript` function in Mozilla Firefox (versions prior to 3.6.24). When `loadSubScript` was used with a content object as its scope parameter, it would improperly unwrap the `XPCNativeWrapper`, allowing the subscript to access content objects directly. This bypasses security restrictions that are meant to prevent scripts loaded via `loadSubScript` from interacting with or modifying content scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper XPCNativeWrapper Unwrapping:** The core issue is the incorrect unwrapping of the `XPCNativeWrapper` when `loadSubScript` is used. This allows a script to access the underlying content window and its properties when it should be isolated.
- **Bypassed Security Restrictions:** This allows scripts loaded by `loadSubScript` to gain access to content objects, which they should not be able to touch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a content script. Specifically, a malicious page could exploit a user who has installed a vulnerable add-on that uses `loadSubScript`.
- **Security Error:** When the bug is fixed, attempting to exploit it results in a "Security Error: Content at ... may not load or link to chrome:..." message in the Error Console, preventing the unauthorized script execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker crafts a malicious web page.
- **Vulnerable Add-on:** The user must have installed a Firefox add-on that makes use of the vulnerable `loadSubScript` function in a way that exposes it to exploitation from content scripts.
- **`loadSubScript` function:** The attack leverages the `loadSubScript` function and its flawed handling of scope.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Serve a Malicious Web Page:** The attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
- **User with Vulnerable Add-on:** The targeted user needs to have a vulnerable add-on installed in their Firefox browser.
- **Understanding of loadSubScript:** The attacker needs knowledge about how `loadSubScript` functions and how to exploit its flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in the 1.9.2 branch of Firefox, which corresponds to Firefox 3.6.x releases.
- The vulnerability was addressed by applying the fix from bug 653926 to the 1.9.2 branch. This fix ensures that the content scope parameter passed to `loadSubScript` is handled properly, preventing the unwrapping of `XPCNativeWrapper` and subsequent access to content objects.
- Firefox versions 7 and later were already fixed by bug 653926
- The vulnerability was reported by Mozilla security researcher `moz_bug_r_a4`.
