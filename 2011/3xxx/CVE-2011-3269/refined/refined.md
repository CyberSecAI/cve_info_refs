- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to create email shortcuts on Lexmark Multifunction Devices that can contain hidden email recipients.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation and display of email recipients when creating shortcuts. This allows attackers to embed hidden recipients that are not visible to the user through the device's operator panel or embedded web server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized disclosure of data. Scanned data, intended for specific recipients, can also be sent to hidden email addresses without the user's knowledge. This results in a confidentiality breach.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves creating or modifying email shortcuts on the Lexmark device using the "Manage Shortcuts" functionality. This can be done either locally at the device or remotely using the embedded web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to manage shortcuts on the affected Lexmark device, either through direct access to the device's interface or through remote access to the embedded web server. This typically requires some level of authentication.
