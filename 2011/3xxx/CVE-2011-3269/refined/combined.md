Lexmark Security Advisory:

1.0
Revision:
Last update:
15 November 2011
Public Release Date:  15 November 2011

Summary
Email shortcut vulnerability

Some Lexmark Multifunction Devices allow the creation of email shortcuts that contain hidden recipients.  This
vulnerability can be exploited to enable unauthorized personnel to receive a covert copy of email sent by the
device using the modified shortcut.

References
CVE:  CVE-2011-3269

Affected Products
Selected Lexmark Laser products; for specific details see “Software Versions & Fixes”

Details
Some Lexmark products allow the creation of pre-defined email addresses (“shortcuts”) to streamline the use of
functions such as “Scan to Email”.  On vulnerable products it is possible to craft a shortcut that contains hidden
email addresses that are not displayed to the user via the operator panel or on the embedded web server.

In the event a hidden email address is added, anyone making use of the shortcut would have their scanned data
sent to additional email addresses they were unaware of, although a close examination of the header of the
delivered email would reveal the additional email addresses.

Impact
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized disclosure of data.

more information see your product’s User Guide or the Embedded Web Server Administrator’s Guide.
