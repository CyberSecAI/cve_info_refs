{
  "CVE-2011-3205": {
    "Description": "A bug exists in the code that parses responses from Gopher servers. The bug results in a buffer overflow if a Gopher server returns a line longer than 4096 bytes. The overflow results in memory corruption and usually crashes Squid.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the gopherToHTML function within the Gopher reply parser. Specifically, it occurs when a Gopher server sends a response line longer than 4096 bytes.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could lead to memory corruption, a denial of service by crashing the Squid proxy, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a malicious Gopher server sending crafted responses with excessively long lines.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to set up a fake Gopher server and be able to forward requests through a vulnerable Squid proxy. They also need the ability to send crafted responses."
