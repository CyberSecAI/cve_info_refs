http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3205
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
A bug exists in the code that parses responses from Gopher servers.
The bug results in a buffer overflow if a Gopher server returns a
line longer than 4096 bytes. The overflow results in memory
corruption and usually crashes Squid.
This is an extension of SQUID-2005:1 which has been opened in the
Squid 3.x version code due to increased packet read sizes.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
A malicious user may set up a fake Gopher server and forward
requests to it through Squid. Specially crafted responses from
that server may cause Squid to restart.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid versions 3.2.0.11, 3.1.15, and
3.0.STABLE26.
In addition, patches addressing this problem can be found in our
patch archives.
Squid-3.0:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/changesets/squid-3.0-9193.patch
Squid-3.1:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/squid-3.1-10363.patch
Squid-3.2:
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/squid-3.2-11294.patch
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-2.x versions are not vulnerable. This problem is
limited to Squid-3.x versions with large read buffer sizes.
Unpatched Squid-3.0 releases up to and including 3.0.STABLE25
are vulnerable.
Unpatched Squid-3.1 releases up to and including 3.1.14 are
vulnerable.
Unpatched Squid-3.2 releases up to and including 3.2.0.10 are
vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
Since real Gopher servers are extremely rare these days, there is
almost no reason for Squid to contact a Gopher server. You can
add a simple access control rule to deny all Gopher requests to
Squid:
acl Gopher proto Gopher
http\_access deny Gopher
Restart or reconfigure Squid after editing squid.conf. Test your
access controls with a simple request:
% squidclient gopher://127.0.0.1/
You should see an "Access Denied" message.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If your install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your primary
support point. For subscription details see
.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed list
(though anyone can post) and security related bug reports are
treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

Does anyone know when this was re-introduced?  The upstream advisory
indicates all 3.0 releases are affected, but doesn't indicate if 2.x
(after 2.5.STABLE7) was at any point vulnerable.

Package        : squid3
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
Debian bug     : 639755
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-3205

Ben Hawkes discovered that squid3, a full featured Web Proxy cache
(HTTP proxy), is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing gopher
server replies.  An attacker can exploit this flaw by connecting to a
gopher server that returns lines longer than 4096 bytes.  This may result
in denial of service conditions (daemon crash) or the possibly the
execution of arbitrary code with rights of the squid daemon.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.STABLE8-3+lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.15-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.15-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 19:53:16 UTC  ``` A flaw was reported [1] in how Squid parsed responses from Gopher servers.  This flaw could result in a buffer overflow if a Gopher server were to return a line longer than 4096 bytes, leading to memory corruption and a crash.  This flaw is an extension of SQUID-2005:1 (or [CVE-2005-0094](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2005-0094)) in Squid 3.x, due to increased packet read sizes.  A malicious user could setup a fake Gopher server and forward requests to it through Squid.  A specially crafted response from that server could cause Squid to restart.  This has been corrected in upstream versions 3.2.0.11, 3.1.15, and 3.0.STABLE26.  Patches for 3.0 [2], 3.1 [3], and 3.2 [4] are available.  [1] <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2011_3.txt> [2] <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.0/changesets/squid-3.0-9193.patch> [3] <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.1/changesets/squid-3.1-10363.patch> [4] <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.2/changesets/squid-3.2-11294.patch>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 19:54:20 UTC  ``` Created squid tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 734584](show_bug.cgi?id=734584 "CLOSED ERRATA - squid: buffer overflow flaw in Squid's Gopher reply parser [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-08-30 20:16:40 UTC  ``` This was assigned the name [CVE-2011-3205](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3205).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-31 11:07:44 UTC  ``` Henrik, is there a reason why your upstream patch duplicates this code?  +        if (!lpos) { +            /* there is no complete line in inbuf */ +            /* copy it to temp buffer */ +            /* note: llen is adjusted above */ +            memcpy(gopherState->buf + gopherState->len, pos, llen); +            gopherState->len += llen; +            break; +        } +        if (!lpos) { +            /* there is no complete line in inbuf */ +            /* copy it to temp buffer */ +            /* note: llen is adjusted above */ +            memcpy(gopherState->buf + gopherState->len, pos, llen); +            gopherState->len += llen; +            break; +        }  It looks harmless, only redundant (albeit probably optimized-out by clever compiler).  As you're also quite familiar with the issue, can you confirm that the 2.x vs. 3.x difference is due to read_sz value change in gopherReadReply?  Or is that not the reason for the previous fix being incomplete in 3.x?   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c4)  Henrik Nordström    2011-08-31 11:41:07 UTC  ``` The duplicated code is a harmless copy-paste error when the change was forward ported from Suqid-2. Now killed. Thanks for noticing! The original patch is       <http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v2/2.HEAD/changesets/12710.patch>  and is on it's way to Squid-2.7 shortly as a normal maintenance/bugfix patch.  And yes, the security issue opened up in Squid-3 due to the change in read buffer size.  Both versions failed to parse gopher responses when a line is split over more than one large packet. But only Squid-3 had an buffer overflow. Fixing the line parser fixes both.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-31 15:44:17 UTC  ``` Thank you for clarifying / confirming!  I've managed to reproduce the overflow, even though it does not trigger crash on RHEL-6 x86.  Apparently adjacent BSS memory does not get used by anything important in my test.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=734583#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-09-14 18:51:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1293 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1293.html>   ``` |  |

Subject: CVE-request(?): squid: buffer overflow in Gopher reply parser

Hi,

squid 3.x seems to have re-introduced a security issue found by Ben Hawkes of
the Google Security Team in 2005,

  2011: <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2011_3.txt>
  2005: <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2005_1.txt> (CVE-2005-0094)

Will there be a new CVE required? Not quite sure how such "special" cases are
handled usually.

Thanks,
Matthias

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
