Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerabilities lies in the lack of input validation within the Omnidocs application. Specifically, the application fails to validate the `FolderRights` and `UserIndex` parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1.  **Privilege Escalation:** The `FolderRights` parameter in the `doclist.jsp` page is not validated. By modifying this parameter to `111111111`, an attacker can gain full access to a folder, including the ability to add/delete documents and folders and place orders. This is due to the application's failure to verify if the user has the actual permissions to perform actions.

2.  **Direct Object Access:** The `UserIndex` parameter in the `editprofile.jsp` page is not validated. This parameter is used to access personal settings pages. An attacker can change this parameter to a different, valid user ID, thereby gaining access to view or change other user's personal settings. This is caused by the application not enforcing proper authorization checks before displaying user profile data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain full control over document folders, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Direct Object Access:** Attackers can access and modify other users' personal settings, potentially resulting in unauthorized access to sensitive information, user impersonation, or defacement of user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vectors are HTTP GET requests where parameters are supplied via the URL to vulnerable JSP pages of the Omnidocs application:
* Modifying `FolderRights` via a GET request to `doclist.jsp`
* Modifying `UserIndex` via a GET request to `editprofile.jsp`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to know or guess the vulnerable URLs and parameters: `doclist.jsp` with `FolderRights`, and `editprofile.jsp` with `UserIndex`.
*   The attacker does not need any authentication to trigger these flaws.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Omnidocs server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 23-Sep-2011, after the vendor failed to respond to the notification.
*   The application is identified as "Omnidocs", a document management platform by NewGen.
*   The identified vulnerabilities are present in all versions of the software, implying the lack of robust input sanitization mechanism.
*   The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Medium", with a CVSS Base Score of 7.5/10
