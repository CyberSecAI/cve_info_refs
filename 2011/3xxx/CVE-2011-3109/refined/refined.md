Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-3109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a "Bad cast in GTK UI," specifically affecting the Linux version of Google Chrome. This means that there was an incorrect type conversion within the GTK (GIMP Toolkit) user interface code, which is used by Chromium for Linux systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bad Type Cast:** The core issue is an improper type cast within the GTK UI framework, which could cause unexpected behaviors and lead to exploitable conditions. This implies a programming error where data of one type is being misinterpreted as another type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The primary impact of this vulnerability is potentially a crash of the application. The advisory from Gentoo states the vulnerability could lead to a "Denial of Service condition". This could disrupt the user's workflow, and potentially be leveraged in a more severe attack chain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is indirect. An attacker would need to entice a user to open a specifically crafted website or Javascript program in Chromium which exploits the bad typecast.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to serve the malicious web content to a user.
*   The user must be using a vulnerable version of Chromium on Linux.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the local network to exploit this issue.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was specific to the Linux platform.
*   The fix for the vulnerability was included in Chromium version 19.0.1084.52
*   The vulnerability was reported by Micha Bartholom√© and was awarded a $1000 bounty
