| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=745479#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-12 13:46:07 UTC  ``` An insecure temporary file use flaw was found in the way atop, an advanced interactive monitor to view the load on system and process level, has kept its temporary runtime data in temporary files. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks (make atop to remove file named 'atop.acct' in the linked-to directory).

Subject: atop: vulnerable to symlink attack via insecure /tmp directory or file
Date: Thu, 14 Apr 2011 20:51:14 +0300
```
Package: atop
Version: 1.23-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hi,

I've just noticed that atop keeps the runtime data in /tmp/atop* directories
or files (mentioned on man page too). I think it was established from a
discussion on debian-devel@l.d.o that this is potentially a security
vulnerability. Probably it should keep its temporary runtime data in its own
directory under /var/run (or /run for next release).

Please consider to backport the fix for 'stable' too.

Thanks

Hi,

I've attached a patch to make atop create decompressed raw logs
safely by using mkstemp.

I think that it's still possible, by making /tmp/atop.d a symbolic
link to a directory containing a file named atop.acct, to make atop
remove the file named atop.acct in the linked-to directory.

Dear maintainer,

I've prepared an NMU for atop (versioned as 1.23-1.1) and
uploaded it to DELAYED/2. Please feel free to tell me if I
should delay it longer.

Be advised that if no problems are found, I will be applying to the Release
Team for permission to upload the same fixes to stable and oldstable.

Regards.

| [Description](#c0)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-04-16 21:31:17 UTC  ``` According to the debian bug at $URL and the atop man page, atop creates temporary files insecurely. From $URL there is partial information:  "I've just noticed that atop keeps the runtime data in /tmp/atop* directories or files (mentioned on man page too). I think it was established from a  discussion on debian-devel@l.d.o that this is potentially a security vulnerability. Probably it should keep its temporary runtime data in its own directory under /var/run (or /run for next release)." ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sebastian Pipping   gentoo-dev  2012-01-09 21:21:39 UTC  ``` Adding CVE found at <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=745479> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Sebastian Pipping   gentoo-dev  2012-01-09 21:46:21 UTC  ``` +*atop-1.26-r1 (09 Jan 2012) + +  09 Jan 2012; Sebastian Pipping <sping@gentoo.org> +atop-1.26-r1.ebuild, +  +files/atop-1.26-cve-2011-3618.patch: +  Integrate custom patch for CVE-2011-3618 ([bug #363887](show_bug.cgi?id=363887 "RESOLVED FIXED - <sys-process/atop-1.27_p3: Insecure temporary file usage (CVE-2011-3618)")) +  1) Stabilize 1.26-r1 ?  2) Review wanted: <http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo-x86/sys-process/atop/files/atop-1.26-cve-2011-3618.patch?view=markup> ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Sebastian Pipping   gentoo-dev  2012-01-09 21:59:14 UTC  ``` FYI I have notified upstream (Gerlof Langeveld) of the patch and issue. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  SpanKY   gentoo-dev  2012-01-13 19:20:28 UTC  ``` this should be respecting $TMPDIR instead of hardcoding /tmp  alternatively, you could create a pipe, fork and exec gzip, and then return the read pipe side.  then you avoid the tempfile issue altogether. ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sebastian Pipping   gentoo-dev  2012-07-23 11:59:02 UTC  ``` FIY Upstream has released 1.27-3 yesterday which includes the patch from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=363887#c2).  +*atop-1.27_p3 (23 Jul 2012) + +  23 Jul 2012; Sebastian Pipping <sping@gentoo.org> +atop-1.27_p3.ebuild: +  Bump to 1.27-3 + ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sean Amoss (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev Security  2012-07-26 12:47:40 UTC  ``` Thanks, Sebastian.

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
