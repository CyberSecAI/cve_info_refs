```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The DBD::mysqlPP Perl module does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries, leading to SQL injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
SQL Injection (CWE-89) vulnerability exists in DBD::mysqlPP versions 0.04 and earlier.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can inject malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to view or alter information stored in the database. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is exploited through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through input fields or parameters that are used by the vulnerable application/module.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the application/module that uses the vulnerable DBD::mysqlPP library. This could be via web forms, API calls, or other input methods. No specific network position is required, as long as the attacker can interact with the application.
