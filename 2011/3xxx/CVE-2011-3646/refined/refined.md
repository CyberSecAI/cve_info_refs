Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3646

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient URL parameter validation in `phpmyadmin.css.php`. Specifically, the `js_frame` parameter was not properly sanitized or checked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Disclosure: When the `js_frame` parameter is supplied as an array, it triggers an error message revealing the full server path of the `phpmyadmin.css.php` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leakage: Attackers can discover the absolute path of the `phpmyadmin.css.php` file on the server. This information is not directly a critical vulnerability on its own, but it could potentially be used in combination with other vulnerabilities to launch more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL Parameter: An attacker would craft a URL that includes the `js_frame` parameter set to an array value, e.g., `phpmyadmin.css.php?js_frame[]=1`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges needed: The attacker just needs to be able to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the server running phpMyAdmin.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to be non-critical.
- The display of the error message requires specific PHP settings: `error_reporting` to be set to `E_ALL`, and `display_errors` to be set to `On`, which are not recommended for production servers.
- The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.x.
- The vulnerability was fixed in phpMyAdmin 3.4.6 and later.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation) and CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
