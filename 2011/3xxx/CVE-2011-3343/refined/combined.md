***monoid* opened the ticket and wrote:**

> There are several locations where the size of memory to be allocated uses a calculation that can overflow, which can lead to a smaller amount of memory than expected to be allocated, allowing possible heap modification. Indeed, this is currently possible with a crafted BMP image of certain dimensions.
>
> The allocation helper routines in alloc\_func.hpp alone suffer from this flaw; namely in the calculation of num\_elements \* sizeof(T).
>
> This patch attempts to fix this by:
>
> \* Checking the internal size calculations in alloc\_func.hpp helpers for overflow
>
> \* Changing the size parameter for these helpers from size\_t to int64, which allows the use of OverflowSafeInt64's in the calculations of other sizes
>
> \* Using OverflowSafeInt64s as just mentioned, in size calculations that maybe/are vulnerable to overflow.
>
> \* A few size calculations are manually checked.
>
> I have attempted to keep the changes to usages of the alloc\_func.hpp helpers minimal but still correct; variables involved in relevant size calculations are simply wrapped with OSI64() (a typedef for OverflowSafeInt64). However, this is still a decently sized patch, and am open to suggestions on how to rework it differently.

In multiple places external data isn’t properly checked before allocating
memory, which could lead to buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution.

These bugs are only exploitable locally by providing OpenTTD with
invalid/manipulated images, sounds or fonts. This means an attacker
either needs local access or has to trick an user into loading a
manipulated image into OpenTTD. This is especially a concern with
BMP files loaded as heightmaps.

All except one vulnerability are caused by improper validation of input
data prior to allocating memory buffers. It is possible to force allocation
of a too small buffer and thus out-of-bounds writes by causing an integer
overflow. Additionally in RLE-compressed BMP images, it is possible to
write arbitrary data outside the allocated buffer.

No patch for releases before 0.3.1 is provided, as this versions are
unsupported since a long time and would require larger changes not worth
the effort.

Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3341 CVE-2011-3342 CVE-2011-3343

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in openttd, a transport
business simulation game. Multiple buffer overflows and off-by-one
errors allow remote attackers to cause denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.2-1+lenny4.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.4-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your openttd packages.

Subject: CVE request for OpenTTD

Hello folks,

the OpenTTD team and contributors have discovered several security
vulnerabilities in OpenTTD. Please be so kind to allocate a CVE id for
each of the issues detailed below:

1.) Denial of service via improperly validated commands

In multiple places in-game commands are not properly validated that allow
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Vulnerability is present since 0.3.5 and will be fixed in the upcoming
1.1.3 release. Issue report at <http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4745>

2.) Buffer overflows in savegame loading

In multiple places indices in savegames are not properly validated that
allow (remote) attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

Vulnerability is present since 0.1.0 and will be fixed in the upcoming
1.1.3 release. Issue reports at <http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4717> and
<http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4748>

3.) Multiple buffer overflows in validation of external data

In multiple places external data from the local file system isn't properly
checked before allocating memory, which could lead to buffer overflows and
arbitrary code execution.

Vulnerability is present since 0.3.4 and will be fixed in the upcoming
1.1.3 release. Issue reports at <http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4746> and
<http://bugs.openttd.org/task/4747>

Once the CVE ids are allocated, each issue will be fully documented at
<http://security.openttd.org/en/CVE-2011-xxxx>

Thanks,
Michael Lutz

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

## Description

[![@DorpsGek](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16524860?u=bc99de718bbd1eca702f44f4fba5c55a342458a8&v=4&size=48)](/DorpsGek)[DorpsGek](https://github.com/DorpsGek)opened [on Aug 25, 2011](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues/4746#issue-312182866)

***monoid* opened the ticket and wrote:**

> This patch fixes errors in the decoding of RLE-compressed BMP format images. The write pointer of the decoder can be positioned anywhere in address space using a series of end-of-line and delta RLE instructions, and then arbitrary data written, leading to i.e. heap/stack modification.
>
> A sample exploit, leading to arbitrary code execution on OpenTTD 1.1.2 on a WinXP SP2 test machine is available upon request.
