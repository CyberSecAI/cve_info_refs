Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from excessive recursion within the `regcomp()` function of the BSD libc implementation when processing complex regular expressions. This excessive recursion leads to memory exhaustion. The same issue is present in JavaScript regular expression implementations of Safari and Firefox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Uncontrolled Recursion:** The regular expression engine does not properly handle deeply nested quantifiers, leading to uncontrolled recursion.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** Processing the crafted regular expressions results in excessive memory allocation, causing a denial-of-service condition.
- **CPU Exhaustion:** In Kaspersky, the excessive processing of the malicious regex causes CPU exhaustion, hindering its ability to operate and restart.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service, either through memory exhaustion or CPU exhaustion.
    -  MacOSX systems experience memory exhaustion, leading to crashes.
    -  Firefox crashes on Windows due to memory exhaustion, with the amount of allocated memory capped by the platform (4 GB) .
    - Kaspersky experiences a full CPU core exhaustion preventing from restarting again.
- **Application Crashes:** Applications using the vulnerable regular expression implementations will crash due to memory allocation failure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local:** Executing a program with a crafted regular expression (like the provided `grep` command) can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Remote:** Delivering a crafted JavaScript regular expression through a website can trigger the vulnerability in browsers (Safari, Firefox).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Regular Expression Input:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted regular expression to the vulnerable system/application. This can be achieved through various means like local commands or web pages.
- **Target Access:** The attacker needs to have access to a system with a vulnerable implementation. For local attacks, this is direct system access. For remote browser attacks, this is achieved by tricking a user to visit a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided example regular expressions involve extensive nesting and repetition using `(.*)` and `{1,100}` patterns.
- The issue is present in multiple environments, including:
    - MacOSX libc
    - Safari
    - Firefox
    - Kaspersky products
- The issue is not considered a security issue by Red Hat and Zabbix, due to the lack of input sanity check in `regcomp()` routine.
- Juniper has patched the issue (CVE-2010-4051 and CVE-2010-4052) in their products.
- The report also shows a memory corruption issue in Firefox, due to out-of-bound access (`int readChecked` method), however, this is not related to CVE-2011-3336.

This report provides more details than the placeholder description, specifying the root cause, affected software, and various denial-of-service scenarios.
