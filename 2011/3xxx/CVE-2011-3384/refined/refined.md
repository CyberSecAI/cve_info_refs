**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper processing of HTML page output based on feed information by the Sage Firefox addon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can embed arbitrary scripts within an RSS/Atom feed.
- When a user views the malicious feed within the Sage addon, the embedded script will execute within the user's Mozilla Firefox, potentially leading to various malicious actions.
  - Possible impact includes:
    - Partial compromise of confidentiality (reading user information)
    - Partial compromise of integrity (modifying user data, web pages)
    - No impact on availability is noted.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (over the internet using packets).
- The attacker needs to inject malicious scripts into a crafted RSS/Atom feed.
- The victim needs to subscribe to and view the malicious feed through the vulnerable Sage addon.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create or modify an RSS/Atom feed to embed malicious scripts.
- The attacker does not require any authentication to launch the attack.
- User interaction is not explicitly required beyond the user's normal use of the add-on. The attack occurs when the user opens/renders the malicious feed.

- A workaround is available (unchecking "Read feed into contents area").
- The vulnerability was reported by Yosuke HASEGAWA of NetAgent Co.,Ltd. to IPA.
- JPCERT/CC rated the Access Required, Authentication and User interaction required measures as High, and Exploit Complexity as High.
- The CVSS v2 score is 5.8 (Medium).
