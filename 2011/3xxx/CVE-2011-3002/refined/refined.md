{
  "CVE-2011-3002": {
    "Description": "Michael Jordon of Context IS reported that in the ANGLE library used by WebGL the return value from `GrowAtomTable()` was not checked for errors. If an attacker could cause requests that exceeded the available memory those would fail and potentially lead to a buffer overrun as subsequent code wrote into the non-allocated space.",
    "Root cause": "The return value of `GrowAtomTable()` was not checked, leading to a potential buffer overrun.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Potential buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "A buffer overrun could occur if memory allocation fails, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "By crafting WebGL content that triggers memory allocation failures in `GrowAtomTable()`",
       "Triggering memory allocation failures via crafted WebGL content"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create and deliver malicious WebGL content."
  },
  "CVE-2011-3003": {
      "Description": "Ben Hawkes of the Google Security Team reported a WebGL test case that demonstrated an out of bounds write after an allocation failed.",
    "Root cause": "Out-of-bounds write due to failure to check the result of memory allocation for WebGL buffer data.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling",
      "Out-of-bounds write vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "An out-of-bounds write could occur following a failed allocation potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By crafting WebGL content that triggers memory allocation failures in `BufferSubData_array`"
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to create and deliver malicious WebGL content."
