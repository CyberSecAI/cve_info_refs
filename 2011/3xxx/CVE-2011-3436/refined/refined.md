- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An access control issue existed in Open Directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An authenticated user could change their account password without providing the current password.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user could change their own password without knowing the old one, potentially allowing unauthorized access if the account was previously compromised and the password was changed by an attacker.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access by an authenticated user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected system.
