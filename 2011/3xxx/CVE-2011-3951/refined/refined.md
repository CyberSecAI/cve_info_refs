  "Root cause of vulnerability": "FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed DPCM files.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of malformed DPCM files leading to potential memory corruption or other exploitable conditions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service via application crash, or possibly arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user invoking the program.",
  "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted DPCM file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a crafted DPCM file.  The attacker also needs to have the ability to create such a file."
