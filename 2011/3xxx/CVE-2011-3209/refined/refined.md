{
  "CVE-2011-3209": {
    "description": "The Linux kernel is vulnerable to a divide error issue in the clock implementation. When sys_clock_gettime() is called for the clock ID of the init process (PID 1), if the task_struct->sched_time is sufficiently large, a divide error fault occurs in sample_to_timespec() because the result of a division becomes bigger than 0xffffffff. This can happen during system boot when the TSC is initialized to zero.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow during a division operation in the `sample_to_timespec()` function when converting the task's scheduling time to a timespec structure.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Improper handling of large values"
    ],
    "impact": "A divide error fault occurs, leading to a kernel panic and system crash when `clock_gettime()` is called for the init process with a large `task_struct->sched_time`.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `sys_clock_gettime()` system call.",
    "required_capabilities": "The vulnerability can be triggered by any process on the system by calling `clock_gettime()` with the clock ID of PID 1, especially during system boot."
