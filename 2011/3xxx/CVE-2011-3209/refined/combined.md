```
x86 is the only arch right now, which provides an optimized for
div_long_long_rem and it has the downside that one has to be very careful that
the divide doesn't overflow.

The API is a little akward, as the arguments for the unsigned divide are
signed.  The signed version also doesn't handle a negative divisor and
produces worse code on 64bit archs.

There is little incentive to keep this API alive, so this converts the few
users to the new API.

Subject: kernel; CVE-2011-2942 and CVE-2011-3209

CVE-2011-2942; In the br_forward_finish() function, we may call kfree()
on the skb we are forwarding, and so, after it, we should not
dereference skb->dev pointer. With the fix, we save skb->dev before
calling the br_forward_finish() function, so that we can use it
afterwards. It's a regression from a commit that we have backported to
our kernels. It doesn't affect the upstream kernel as the code was
rewritten.

CVE-2011-3209; divide error issue in the clock implementation.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 02:59:06 UTC  ``` Description of Problem: The call trace is as follows:  crash> bt PID: 16963  TASK: f7415aa0  CPU: 0   COMMAND: "1-2.run-test"  #0 [eb1c4e20] crash_kexec at c04434bd  #1 [eb1c4e64] die at c04064d3  #2 [eb1c4e94] do_divide_error at c0406ac5  #3 [eb1c4f44] error_code (via divide_error) at c0405abb     EAX: 5e3c58c2  EBX: 3b9aca00  ECX: fffffe4c  EDX: fffffe4c  EBP: eb1c4000      DS:  007b      ESI: eb1c4fac  ES:  007b      EDI: eb1c4fac     CS:  0060      EIP: c04374cd  ERR: ffffffff  EFLAGS: 00210246   #4 [eb1c4f78] sample_to_timespec at c04374cd  #5 [eb1c4f8c] posix_cpu_clock_get at c0438744  #6 [eb1c4fa8] sys_clock_gettime at c04367f3  #7 [eb1c4fb8] system_call at c0404f44     EAX: ffffffda  EBX: fffffff2  ECX: bfe85f78  EDX: 00967ff4      DS:  007b      ESI: fffffff2  ES:  007b      EDI: 00000000     SS:  007b      ESP: bfe85f3c  EBP: bfe85f58     CS:  0073      EIP: 00963e75  ERR: 00000109  EFLAGS: 00200246   Here is [customer's] analysis of the problem.  Processing clock_gettime system call reached Divide Error Fault as described below:  1) clock_gettime system call is called with 0xfffffff2, which is clock ID of    the init process whose process ID is 1.    The clock ID is got from clock_getcpuclockid(1,&clock_id).  2) posix_cpu_clock_get() sets cpu_time_count->sched to    task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 and calls sample_to_timespec(). 3) sample_to_timespec() divides cpu_time_count->sched by NSEC_PER_SEC using    div_long_long_rem(). 4) The result of the division becomes bigger than 0xffffffff. 5) Divide Error Fault occurs.  The reason why Divide Error Fault occurs is the huge task_struct->sched_time of PDI#1. When sys_clock_gettime() was called, task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 was 0xfffffe4c5e3c58c2.  The task_struct->sched_time is increased by update_cpu_clock() while handling local timer interrupts as follows.   --- static inline void update_cpu_clock(struct task_struct *p, struct rq *rq, unsigned long long now) {         p->sched_time += now - max(p->timestamp, rq->timestamp_last_tick); } ---  The 'now' argument is got from TSC and if it is nearly zero, p->sched_time becomes very large. It can happen while system booting on which TSC is initialized to zero as follows.  ---   init() "init/main.c"   -> smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus)      -> synchronize_tsc_bp()         -> write_tsc()            => TSC is initialized to 0 ---  So the summary of the problem is as follows:  1) TSC is initialized to zero during system booting. 2) update_cpu_clock() is called just after 1) then task_struct->sched_time of    PID#1 becomes very large. 3) sys_clock_gettime() is called for clock ID of PID#1. 4) Divide Error Fault occurs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 03:04:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Yasuaki Ishimatsu for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 03:13:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as they either do not have the sample_to_timespec() function, or have already backported upstream commit f8bd2258, which addresses this issue.

Processing clock_gettime system call reached Divide Error Fault as described below:  1) clock_gettime system call is called with 0xfffffff2, which is clock ID of    the init process whose process ID is 1.    The clock ID is got from clock_getcpuclockid(1,&clock_id).  2) posix_cpu_clock_get() sets cpu_time_count->sched to    task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 and calls sample_to_timespec(). 3) sample_to_timespec() divides cpu_time_count->sched by NSEC_PER_SEC using    div_long_long_rem(). 4) The result of the division becomes bigger than 0xffffffff. 5) Divide Error Fault occurs.  The reason why Divide Error Fault occurs is the huge task_struct->sched_time of PDI#1. When sys_clock_gettime() was called, task_struct->sched_time of PID#1 was 0xfffffe4c5e3c58c2.  The task_struct->sched_time is increased by update_cpu_clock() while handling local timer interrupts as follows.   --- static inline void update_cpu_clock(struct task_struct *p, struct rq *rq, unsigned long long now) {         p->sched_time += now - max(p->timestamp, rq->timestamp_last_tick); } ---  The 'now' argument is got from TSC and if it is nearly zero, p->sched_time becomes very large. It can happen while system booting on which TSC is initialized to zero as follows.  ---   init() "init/main.c"   -> smp_prepare_cpus(max_cpus)      -> synchronize_tsc_bp()         -> write_tsc()            => TSC is initialized to 0 ---  So the summary of the problem is as follows:  1) TSC is initialized to zero during system booting. 2) update_cpu_clock() is called just after 1) then task_struct->sched_time of    PID#1 becomes very large. 3) sys_clock_gettime() is called for clock ID of PID#1. 4) Divide Error Fault occurs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c2)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 03:04:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Yasuaki Ishimatsu for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=732878#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-08-24 03:13:47 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as they either do not have the sample_to_timespec() function, or have already backported upstream commit f8bd2258, which addresses this issue.
