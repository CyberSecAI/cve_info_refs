Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-3653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a bug in the driver for Intel integrated GPUs on Mac OS X. This bug resulted in random images from GPU memory being incorporated into WebGL textures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-origin information leakage:** The vulnerability allowed a malicious website to read arbitrary image data from the GPU memory, including potentially sensitive data from other applications or browser windows. This data could be extracted by manipulating WebGL textures and reading the pixel data.
- **Incorrect Memory Access:** The core issue was the GPU driver accessing video memory it shouldn't have, leading to the exposure of data from other contexts.
- **glGenerateMipmap bug:**  A related issue was a bug in `glGenerateMipmap` that sometimes corrupted textures, specifically if the texture object's minification filter didn't need mipmaps when the call was made. This was initially suspected as the primary cause but later determined to be a consequence of the broader memory access issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information displayed on the user's screen, such as passwords, personal data, or application content.
- **Privacy Violation:** Users' privacy could be violated, as data from other applications or windows could be exposed without user consent.
- **Cross-site data theft:** The vulnerability could be used to steal cross-site data through the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious website using WebGL can trigger the vulnerability by creating and manipulating cube map textures.
- The attacker needs to display or have displayed sensitive information before the vulnerable code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious website that uses WebGL.
- The target system must be running Mac OS X with an Intel integrated GPU and a vulnerable driver. Specifically, Mac OS X versions prior to 10.7.2 were affected.
- The attacker would have to rely on the user visiting the malicious page while other sensitive data is present in the GPU memory.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability specifically affected cube map textures, a specific type of texture in WebGL.
- The problem could be triggered when using `glGenerateMipmap` with certain texture settings, although the primary issue was incorrect memory access by the GPU when rendering to a cube map face.
- Initially, workarounds such as modifying the minification filter settings or emulating `glGenerateMipmap` were attempted but proved ineffective.
- The eventual fix involved limiting the maximum size of cube map textures to 512 pixels on affected systems, and preventing attaching a cube map face to a framebuffer.
- The vulnerability was also reproducible on Chrome, indicating that it was a low-level problem.
- The issue was fixed in Firefox 8, SeaMonkey 2.5, and Thunderbird 8 by limiting the cube map size to 512 pixels and preventing the usage of cube maps on framebuffers.
- Some sources initially suspected an out-of-memory (OOM) condition related to `glGenerateMipmap` as a root cause.
