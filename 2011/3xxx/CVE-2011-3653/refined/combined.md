# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-51

## Cross-origin image theft on Mac with integrated Intel GPU

Announced
November 8, 2011
Reporter
Claus Wahlers
Impact
High
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 8
* SeaMonkey 2.5
* Thunderbird 8

### Description

**Claus Wahlers** reported that random images from GPU memory
were showing up in WebGL textures. Once incorporated into the WebGL graphics it
is possible for a site to programatically read the image data and potentially
gain sensitive data from other things that had been displayed earlier. This
problem is due to a bug in the driver for Intel integrated GPUs on recent
Mac OS X hardware, and the problem can be seen in WebGL implementations from
other vendors. Mozilla has implemented a work-around to prevent this from
happening with this hardware-driver combination.

The background cube texture does not render correctly. What i see is randomly garbled artefacts of parts of my screen. See attached screenshots.
The effect is very similar to what has already been reported in this bug: [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=631258](/show_bug.cgi?id=631258 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebGL shader paints using arbitrary textures, some even belonging to other processes, on Mac OS 10.5") - just that i run a different OS version and a different graphics card.
Note that i can reproduce this issue (even after rebooting my machine), and that Chrome 13 shows the exact same problem (suggesting that it is a low level problem, possibly with the graphics card drivers).

Sorry to stubbornly asking for confirming this multiple times, but this is really very important:
Are you sure you can reproduce this IMMEDIATELY after rebooting your machine, without first letting it sleep, without letting any screensaver run, etc? I would also like to know if you can reproduce this without running any other application than just Firefox and Mac OS itself (and the Finder) since you rebooted?

Two things that would be nice to know:
1. can any of us developers here reproduce this issue?
2. can this issue be reproduced on Mac OS 10.7? AIUI 10.7 has GL-accelerated 2D graphics so for example Safari would in principle have the same bug exposed via Canvas 2D.

@ Claus: you said this is a MacBook Pro with Intel graphics. Many MacBook Pro computers have a discrete GPU, and my understanding is that many have dual GPUs (Intel and discrete). Do you have a discrete (ATI or NVIDIA) GPU in this machine? Sometimes it's hard to know which GPU is used.

Apparently the gfxCardStatus tool can tell you that and, in the case of a dual GPU machine, allow you to force usage of a specific GPU:

Another thing you can do is, in Firefox, go to the special about:support page. Scroll down to Graphics, please paste the Graphics section here.

All options are enabled, but i can't seem to select the Discrete Only and Dynamic Switching options.

Thanks. All that is pretty conclusive that there is only Intel integrated graphics here.
> Adapter Description: 0x24300,0x20400
0x24300 means recent Intel GPU, 0x20400 is the software rendering fallback
Firefox has a bug making it use the discrete GPU when there is one: [bug 646043](/show_bug.cgi?id=646043 "RESOLVED FIXED - Hardware acceleration seems to require discrete GPU on Macs with two GPUs"). The fact that about:support plus gfxCardStatus agree that you have Intel only is quite conclusive.

I've been able to reproduce incorrect rendering of the cube map texture in the above sample on a MacBook Pro with a dual NVIDIA/Intel GPU, using gfxCardStatus to force the use of the integrated GPU. I was testing with a Chromium, not a Firefox, build, which indicates a driver bug. I don't see random contents of VRAM in the textures, but some black areas and stretched or skewed rendering of the cube map on two of the faces.
I recall a similar rendering artifact on Mac OS some time ago where calling glGenerateMipmapsEXT would sometimes corrupt textures, specifically if the texture object's minification filter didn't need mipmaps at the time the call was made. In Chromium a workaround was added to temporarily change the filtering mode of the texture. I'll need to review the code to see if we implemented a similar workaround for cube map textures and if that seems to be the problem here.

OK, that's very interesting. I was going to ask what happens if the wrap modes are CLAMP\_TO\_EDGE and the texture is NPOT, but Macs have desktop OpenGL with full support for NPOT textures, so there is no problem.
If that still doesn't work then a different class of work-arounds might be to avoid calling glGenerateMipmaps altogether and implement ourselves... using the texture to paint a quad on a framebuffer backed by a texture of half the size, then on another with 1/4 the size, etc... This wouldn't be the first crazy Mac GL workaround we have to do.

Please approve. Really innocuous patch with a high probability of fixing this really bad bug.
Ignore the tryserver build, it seems to have choked but it was based of mozilla-inbound code and the failure seems unrelated to my patch so I'm ignoring it.
Please test tomorrow's Nightly build.

Unfortunately, the corrupted rendering persists with the nightly dated 9.0a1 (2011-09-10), on a MacBook Pro with dual Intel HD Graphics (Device ID 0x0046) and NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M. I quit all applications, used gfxCardStatus to force use of the integrated GPU, launched the nightly and navigated to the above sample.
Does the build I used contain this fix?

Thanks a lot again for checking this (in addition to thanks for the glGenerateMipmap hint!)
Just for the record the way to check this for sure is got to about:buildconfig, and check the changeset id and compare in the hg log to the id for this fix, which is db67bdba5ca8.
Looking in the nightlies archive, it seems that the changeset ID is 06b2977afb85:
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2011-09-10-03-08-51-mozilla-central/firefox-9.0a1.en-US.mac.txt>
I confirm that it does contain this patch.
So that means that the corruption you're seeing is not fixed by this patch.
I would still like to know if the corruption originally reported in this bug is fixed by this patch. Indeed the one you're seeing seems a bit different:
(In reply to Kenneth Russell from [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=684882#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - Random video memory grabbed into WebGL cube map textures on Mac OS, including on 10.7.1, on Intel GPUs"))

I would still like to know if the other-windows-grabbed-into-WebGL-textures bug originally reported here is fixed by this bug.

Similar issue been discussed here, with a GL trace:
<http://lists.apple.com/archives/mac-opengl/2011/Jul/msg00011.html>
The reply says that Apple is aware of the issue and it's happening in certain OOM conditions...
-> when the bug happens, do you get a OUT\_OF\_MEMORY WebGL error?
This other discussion,
<http://www.opengl.org/discussion_boards/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=273603>
recommends the exact same workaround as I implemented... it seems to be working for them.

Two new tryserver builds. I appreciate a lot if you can check them again. I understand it's time-consuming but we desperately need to work around this bug. These are my last attempts before I completely give up on calling glGenerateMipmap and emulate it completely, but that would be a long patch to write and would hurt performance.

This patch preallocates all images in all mipmap levels with zero data, so that glGenerateMipmap shouldn't have to allocate any buffer. The hope is that that will dodge the bug.
If this doesn't work, then this second patch:
[https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/bjacob@mozilla.com-e80e7435e38f/](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/try-builds/bjacob%40mozilla.com-e80e7435e38f/)
Goes back to the original approach discussed above, since it seems to be working for people, and adds a glFinish() call after glGenerateMipmap before we reset the texture minification filter. The idea is to ensure that glGenerateMipmap does get (as a result of another bug) postponed until after the minification filter is restored. Of course in principle this should not be needed but since we're on the topic of bugs...

I tried both of the above builds but unfortunately they still exhibit the problem.
Before you write a huge patch reimplementing glGenerateMipmaps, I think that we should try modifying the app locally to understand what operations it's doing. I'm not even sure it's trying to use a mipmapped cube map at all. If we can figure out some small changes to make the app work, we will understand better what workaround, if any, we could do in the WebGL implementation.
Do you have hardware in house that reproduces the problem? I will try to start looking at the demo's source code later today or tomorrow.

Here's a trace of Firefox running this demo, recorded in APItrace, on my linux machine:
2598 glGenTextures(n = 1, textures = &5)

2619 glGetError() = GL\_NO\_ERROR
2621 glGetError() = GL\_NO\_ERROR

2631 glTexParameteri(target = GL\_TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP, pname = GL\_TEXTURE\_WRAP\_T, param = GL\_CLAMP\_TO\_EDGE)
2633 glTexParameteri(target = GL\_TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP, pname = GL\_TEXTURE\_MAG\_FILTER, param = GL\_LINEAR)
2635 glTexParameteri(target = GL\_TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP, pname = GL\_TEXTURE\_MIN\_FILTER, param = GL\_LINEAR\_MIPMAP\_LINEAR)
2637 glGenerateMipmap(target = GL\_TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP)
I have only removed glXGetCurrentContext calls, otherwise these lines are contiguous in the trace.
So it is calling glGenerateMipmap on a cube map texture. Interestingly the min filter is GL\_LINEAR\_MIPMAP\_LINEAR defeating our theory that this bug would be specific to min filters not requiring a mipmap.

The active texture unit is the 2nd one:
2600 glActiveTexture(texture = GL\_TEXTURE1)
Do you think this might remotely be worth setting to GL\_TEXTURE0 to see if the bug persists?

No, we've not been able to reproduce the bug at Mozilla.

Two things could use clarification.
Is the other Benoit able to reproduce the bug described by the OP or the bug described in [comment #14](/show_bug.cgi?id=684882#c14 "VERIFIED FIXED - Random video memory grabbed into WebGL cube map textures on Mac OS, including on 10.7.1, on Intel GPUs").
The bug title claims the bug affects all GPUs yet GfxCardStatus was needed to reproduce by forcing selection of a specific GPU. Seems like a contradiction.

The original bug. I saw his screen and it did have a corrupt texture with contents from his desktop.

Benoit could only reproduce with his integrated Intel GPU, set with gfxCardStatus. He could not reproduce with his ATI card.

It seems that the only report we've seen of this bug on a non-intel GPU was [bug 631258](/show_bug.cgi?id=631258 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebGL shader paints using arbitrary textures, some even belonging to other processes, on Mac OS 10.5"), however that was on Mac OS 10.5. It seems that on recent Mac OS versions this bug can only be reproduced on Intel GPUs.
Updated steps to reproduce:
1. use gfxCardStatus to force usage of the Intel GPU
2. In Firefox or Chrome, go to
<http://people.mozilla.org/~bjacob/webgltexturecubemap.html>
or
<http://people.mozilla.org/~bjacob/webgltexturecubemap-blank.html>
These pages are much simpler than the link in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=684882#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Random video memory grabbed into WebGL cube map textures on Mac OS, including on 10.7.1, on Intel GPUs"). All they do is a cube map with a mipmap.
Expected results:
\* webgltexturecubemap.html shows see a triangle painted with a green/black cube map
\* webgltexturecubemap-blank.html shows a white triangle (blank white cube map)
Actual results:
Rendering shows random texture memory from other applications blended into the texture.Summary: Random video memory grabbed into WebGL textures on Mac OS, including on 10.7.1, on all GPUs → Random video memory grabbed into WebGL textures on Mac OS, including on 10.7.1, on Intel GPUs

Conversation with Ken and Daniel-from-Transgaming today, 2 interesting facts:
\* this glGenerateMipmap bug is only a consequence of a more far-reaching bug: illegal video memory is accessed when rendering to a face of a cube map. So we also need a patch to prevent attaching a face of a cube map to a framebuffer.
-> this kills any hope of a work-around using the GPU to generate the mipmap.
\* there's agreement that there seem to have been 2 separate bugs:
1. [bug 631258](/show_bug.cgi?id=631258 "RESOLVED FIXED - WebGL shader paints using arbitrary textures, some even belonging to other processes, on Mac OS 10.5") affected all GPUs, and all texture types, and seemed to be affected by texture minification filter, and seems to have been fixed in Mac OS 10.6+
2. the present bug seems to be Intel-only and limited to cube maps, and unaffected by texture minification filter (as said above, it is purely about rendering to a cube map).
Since the present bug seems limited to cube maps, mipmapping only needs to be disabled for cube maps, which is more acceptable.

Attached patch

[work around cube map bug](attachment.cgi?id=561683&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=561683&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=684882&attachment=561683)

This patch does 3 things on Macs with Intel GPUs:
\* prevents attaching a cube map to a framebuffer.
Test case: <http://codeflow.org/webgl/irradiance/>
\* skips glGenerateMipmaps on cube maps
\* since cube maps are now missing their mipmaps, prevents setting on them a minification filter that requires a mipmap, but only from OpenGL's point of view, not from WebGL's.
Note the Intel check is performed on GL context creation. You told me not to worry about that, that you would handle it once GPUs start changing under our feet... thanks :-)

Seems like we need:
1) some clarity about if the current set of patches are a complete and comprehensive set of fixes.
2) get the patches landed on nightly and test
3) think about if we need to try and get the patches into fx7 or prepare for a chemspill if this gets widespread discovery. fact that its observable on public test cases and blog post could lead to wider discovery.

Also, this bug seems fixed in 10.7.2 so we should only block on a version less than 10.7.2

Not possible: the textarget parameter here indicates the precise face in case of a cube map, e.g. LOCAL\_GL\_TEXTURE\_CUBE\_MAP\_POSITIVE\_X, so the if() would be a lot heavier this way.

Summary is given once in the WorkAroundCubeMapBug684882 function itself. I thought it was not worth repeating it everytime it's used.

OK, I also Benoit Girard's report today that it seems fixed on 10.7.2. Will do as a follow-up bug if you want. It's nontrivial to me how quickly we want to rely on that, since this bug never was reproducible on \_all\_ Mac/Intel machines, so it's not clear how conclusive a test done on one machine can be.

Yes, the current patch, <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=561683> , is a full fix by itself for all the issues discussed here. It overwrites the previous patch, which turned out to not fix the issue.
>

On tryserver at the moment, will report to this bug once it's built. Plan to land today on m-c.

Now that we know what the issue is, it's clear that it is quite easy to run into if you have a Mac with only Intel graphics (Macbook Air) and have not yet upgraded to Mac OS 10.7.2.
If we can take this as a last minute fix in Firefox 7, then great (but I would be surprised if we could do that this late). If we can land this on the release branch so it will make it into 7.0.1 if there is a 7.0.1, then great. What I don't know is if this issue is by itself severe enough to warrant a chemspill or generally panic about it.
A Chrome developer told me today that:
1) Chrome is NOT going to respond to this by blacklisting WebGL on Mac/Intel. Instead they will do a work-around like us.
2) Their patch will be very similar to ours, and has yet to be written.

I more mean what does the code below do? and how it is related to cube maps being broken?

Claus tells me that he can still reproduce the bug... I wonder if something went wrong in the Intel vendor check. Pushed to try a patch that always does the workaround on Mac, not just on Intel GPUs. Tryserver will report to this bug.

It does. But if it's confirmed that 10.7.2 fixes the whole bug, we'll be able to limit that to 10.7.1 and older versions.

Attached patch

[blacklist WebGL on Intel GPUs, on Mac OS < 10.7.2, quick&dirty version for firefox 8](attachment.cgi?id=562956&action=diff) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=562956&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=684882&attachment=562956)

The first patch above relied on Jeff's GfxInfo.mm improvements that just landed on inbound.
If we want something less intrusive to ship in Firefox 8 (or even in a 7.0.1...) this new patch is it. The problem is that without Jeff's new GfxInfo.mm patches, on a dual-GPU Mac, GfxInfo doesn't really know which GPU we're using. The quick solution is to implement that in WebGLContext initialization once we already have a GL context. It's not great as it means we still pay the price of waiting for a GL context to be created before we decide not to allow WebGL, but it's not too terrible and is the best I can do with a non-intrusive patch.

Actually, I tried today, and the answer seemed to be 'no'. At least for 512x512 and 256x256 I couldn't reproduce. But I didn't quite try hard enough to be sure.

Interesting.
Indeed I've read reports than the returned MAX\_CUBE\_MAP\_TEXTURE\_SIZE is too optimistic on OSX/IntelGPU and is actually between two and three times smaller than reported (what is the returned value on your test setup?)
If we can confirm it is safe, it would make sense imho to reduce MAX\_CUBE\_MAP\_TEXTURE\_SIZE on our side (or perhaps force the minimum profile [[Bug 686732](/show_bug.cgi?id=686732 "RESOLVED FIXED - Implement minimal-capabilities WebGL mode")]) - which would be less disruptive than disabling WebGL completely.

And yes, I think that if we can find a size under which things work we should definitely go with that approach.

I do not think marking this "RESOLVED FIXED" is appropriate. You have a workaround that fixes the security problem but the underlying problem in the graphics driver remains and the workaround breaks app's that fail to check and accommodate the max size of a cube map face. You need an open tracking bug to remind you to remove the workaround when the OpenGL driver is fixed.

limit cube map size to 512
This issue was discussed during today's WebGL conference call.
Ken reported that he could still reproduce the bug, using the original testcase (mrdoob's car demo) on Mac OS 10.7.2. So we can forget about the OS version check for now.
I synced with other browser vendors about the timeframe to ship a workaround. There was no objection against us releasing a workaround whenever we want, the point being that this issue has already been blogged about publicly. However, I think, and I replied, that once a Firefox version mentions it among the security fixes, this issue will get a lot more attention than it has so far, so I would still say we need to be considerate about the timeframe to avoid hurting other browser vendors and the WebGL platform in general. Shipping this workaround in Firefox 8 seems like the correct compromise. It's a predictable date for other browser vendors, as opposed to a 7.0.2 release which could ship at any time.
-> please approve for beta and aurora

FTR, i just retested and can confirm that the current nightly fixes the bug on my system (Mac OS X 10.6.8, Intel GFX). The mrdoob demo shows a black cube map. Great job!
And please accept my apologies for blogging the issue. I was acting as a slightly creeped out user, and not as the responsible developer that i am supposed to be. Next time i know better.

Indeed I was wrong, Stage3D doesn't limit the max texture size to 512 but to 1024, that's why they expose the bug.

I don't understand that: this bug was essentially fixed in Firefox 8. There seems to be one corner case still left open, when we switch GPUs, but that still isn't fixed (and is not nearly as easy to reproduce as the bug originally discussed here).

Can we get someone with a macbook air to reproduce this and verify the fix? My Macbook Pros both have the NVIDIA graphics, and doesn't exhibit the problem.

Using OS X 10.7.2 on my 11" inch air with <http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/examples/webgl_materials_cars_anaglyph.html>, I see no difference between Firefox 9, beta 6 and Chrome. I just get the outlines of the car model in red and green.
In Firefox 8.0.1, I see the same behavior as Firefox 9b6.
With Firefox 7, I get a vehicle model on a background of a bridge. If this is the desired behavior, this is not fixed in 9b6.
My video card is Intel HD Graphics 3000 384 MB.

The broken behavior you're seeing on 8+ is wanted. The bug was that contents of other windows would be shown in the webgl scene. The broken rendering is intentional, to avoid that security issue.

Benoit, so based on [comment 84](/show_bug.cgi?id=684882#c84 "VERIFIED FIXED - Random video memory grabbed into WebGL cube map textures on Mac OS, including on 10.7.1, on Intel GPUs"), can this bug be marked verified?

Just FYI, I submitted a patch to three.js to deal with this in three.js

@ Gregg, that's great. By the way, to help web devs test portability of their code, we now have a minimal-capability mode: webgl.min\_capability\_mode and a no-extensions mode: webgl.disable-extensions.

The underlying Apple bug isn't fixed. However, it's been discussed on public forum for a long time, as a Google search for | mac texture corruption | shows:
<https://www.google.ca/search?q=mac+texture+corruption>
It's even been blogged about publicly in the particular context of Firefox/WebGL, by the original bug reported here:

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?
