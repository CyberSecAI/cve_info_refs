  {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `nipplib.dll` component of the Novell iPrint Client. The `GetDriverSettings` method assembles a log string by copying user-supplied data (hostname/port) into a fixed-length stack buffer without proper bounds checking.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by a remote attacker if a user visits a malicious web page or opens a malicious file. This requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerable code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious web page or provide a malicious file. The victim needs to be using the vulnerable Novell iPrint Client and be induced to interact with the malicious content."
