Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue found in the Zikula Application Framework.
*   Input passed via the `themename` parameter to `ztemp/view_compiled/Theme/theme_admin_setasdefault.php` is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML or script code into a web page that is then displayed to other users. Specifically, the 'themename' parameter is vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within an administrator's browser session.
*   **Account Compromise:**  By executing malicious JavaScript code, an attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the administrator, leading to further compromise of the system.
*   **Website Defacement:** The injected script could modify the content of the page, defacing the website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameter (`themename`).
*   **Remote:** The attack can be performed remotely without requiring any local access or authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable Zikula application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `themename` parameter and its location (`ztemp/view_compiled/Theme/theme_admin_setasdefault.php`).
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious script within the `themename` parameter.

**Additional Information:**
