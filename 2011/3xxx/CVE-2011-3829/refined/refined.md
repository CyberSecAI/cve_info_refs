Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3829

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the disclosure of the upload directory used to store attachments in the `ftp_upload_file.php` script of Support Incident Tracker (SiT) versions 3.65 and earlier.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Information Disclosure:** The application reveals the directory where attachments are stored. This information is valuable for further exploitation, particularly when combined with the arbitrary file upload vulnerability (CVE-2011-3833).
-   **Lack of input validation:** The  `ftp_upload_file.php` does not validate the type of file being uploaded, allowing any file type to be uploaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   The information disclosure vulnerability (CVE-2011-3829) allows an attacker to discover the upload path. This, combined with the arbitrary file upload vulnerability (CVE-2011-3833), leads to remote command execution.
- An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file (web shell) to the server and execute arbitrary code by accessing the uploaded file.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely over HTTP.
-   **Web Interface:** The attack is launched through the web interface of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid user credentials to log into the Support Incident Tracker application before exploiting the vulnerabilities.
-   **Knowledge of Application Location:** The attacker needs to know the base URI of the Support Incident Tracker installation.

**Additional Notes:**
-   The exploit combines two separate vulnerabilities present in `ftp_upload_file.php` to achieve Remote Command Execution.
-   This exploit has a corresponding Metasploit module that automates the exploitation process.
-   The vulnerability was originally discovered by Secunia Research.
-   The identified vulnerabilities are present in Support Incident Tracker version 3.65 and earlier.
