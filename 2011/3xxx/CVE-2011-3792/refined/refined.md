Subject: Re: CVE request: Joomla unspecified information
 disclosure vulnerability

Path Disclosure should better be regarded as more closely related to
server-side issue.
It may be too redundant or unnecessary to create one path disclosure
issue per CVE.

Another Path Disclosure issue in Joomla! 1.6.1

<http://bl0g.yehg.net/2011/04/joomla-161-and-lower-information.html>

Almost all php CMS applications have this issue going on where  some
of them are listed at:

<http://code.google.com/p/inspathx/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fpaths_vuln>
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Path Disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! 1.6.1 and possibly other PHP CMS applications.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path disclosure, which reveals the server's internal file structure.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure. Attackers can gain knowledge of the server's file structure, potentially aiding further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Accessing vulnerable URLs or features that expose file paths.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be able to access vulnerable parts of the web application.

The content mentions a path disclosure issue in Joomla! 1.6.1 and also refers to a list of vulnerable applications with similar issues.
