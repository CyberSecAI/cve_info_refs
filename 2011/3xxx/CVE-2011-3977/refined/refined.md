Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `nxconfigure.sh` script, intended to be used by NX Server Manager for configuration updates, was a SUID (Set User ID) script. This allowed any user on the system to execute the script with the privileges of the script's owner (typically root).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SUID Misuse:** The primary weakness was the misuse of the SUID bit on the `nxconfigure.sh` script. This allowed any user to execute the script with elevated privileges.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Due to the vulnerability, users could manipulate the script's execution to run arbitrary commands on the system with root privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker could gain root-level access to the system, potentially leading to full system compromise.
- **Data Breach:**  An attacker could access or modify sensitive data.
- **Service Disruption:** An attacker could disrupt the availability of the service and system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** Any user on the system could exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local user account:** An attacker only needs to have a local user account on the affected system.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content contains more detail than the typical CVE description which would include references.
- The issue is resolved in `nxuexec-3.5.0-2` and `nxserver-3.5.0-5`.
- A workaround was provided: removing the original script and replacing it with a fake file. This stops the ability to configure the server via the NX Server Manager interface until the server software is updated.
