## The nxconfigure.sh script can allow the execution of arbitrary commands on the system

The nxconfigure.sh script, a SUIDed script used by NX Server Manager to update the server configuration, could be executed by any user to execute arbitrary commands on the system.

A possible workaround, until the new node and server packages fixing this issue are available, is to remove the nxconfigure.sh script and replace it with a fake file:

# rm /usr/NX/scripts/restricted/nxconfigure.sh
# touch /usr/NX/scripts/restricted/nxconfigure.sh

Please note that by applying this workaround, you will be no longer able to configure the server via NX Server Manager interface until you upgrade your NX server installation to the new package.
