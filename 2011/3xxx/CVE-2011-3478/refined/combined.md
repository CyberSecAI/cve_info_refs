# Date: 2015-10-31
# Exploit Author: Tomislav Paskalev
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.symantec.com/
# Software Link: http://esdownload.symantec.com/akdlm/CD/MTV/pcAnywhere_12_5_MarketingTrialware.exe
#   Version: Symantec pcAnywhere v12.5.0 Build 442 (Trial)
# Vulnerable Software:
#   Symantec pcAnywhere 12.5.x through 12.5.3
#   Symantec IT Management Suite pcAnywhere Solution 7.0 (aka 12.5.x) and 7.1 (aka 12.6.x)
# Tested on:

#   Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 x86 EN
# CVE ID: 2011-3478
# OSVDB-ID: 78532
################################################################
# Vulnerability description:
#   The application's module used for handling incoming connections
#   (awhost32.exe) contains a flaw. When handling authentication
#   requests, the vulnerable process copies user provided input
#   to a fixed length buffer without performing a length check.
#   A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability
#   to cause a buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code in the
#   context of the exploited application (installed as a service
#   by default, i.e. with "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges).
################################################################
# Target application notes:
#   - the application processes one login attempt at a time
#     (i.e. multiple parallel login requests are not possible)
#   - available modules (interesting exploit wise):
#     Name         | Rebase | SafeSEH | ASLR  | NXCompat | OS Dll
#    -------------------------------------------------------------

#     IMPLODE.DLL  | False  | False   | False |  False   | False
#    -------------------------------------------------------------
#   - supported Windows x86 operating systems (pcAnywhere v12.5)
#       - Windows 2000
#       - Windows 2003 Server
#       - Windows 2008 Server
#       - Windows XP
#       - Windows Vista
#       - Windows 7
################################################################
# Exploit notes:
#   - bad characters: "\x00"
#   - Windows Vista, Windows 2008 Server, Windows 7
#     - after a shellcode execution event occurs, the
#       application does not crash and remains fully functional
#       - one successful shellcode execution event has a low
#         success rate (applies to all OSes)
#         - in order to achieve an overall more reliable exploit,
#           multiple shellcode executions need to be performed
#           (until the shellcode is successfully executed)
#           - brute force is a feasible method
#             - multiple parallel brute force attacks are not possible
#   - multiple valid offsets are available (i.e. not just the
#     ones tested)
################################################################
# Test notes:
#   - all tested OSes
#     - clean default installations
#   - all OS specific statistics referenced in the exploit are
#     based on the test results of 10 attempts per tested offset
#     - all attempts were performed after a system reboot (VM)
#     - the provided test results should be taken only as a rough guide
#       - in practice it might occur that the number of attempts
#         needed to achieve successful exploitation is (much)
#         higher than the maximum value contained in the test
#         results, or that the exploit does not succeed at all
#         - other (untested) offsets might provide better results
#   - not letting the OS and application load fully/properly before
#     starting the exploit may lead to failed exploitation (this
#     observation was made during the testing of the exploit and
#     applies mostly to Windows 7)

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
