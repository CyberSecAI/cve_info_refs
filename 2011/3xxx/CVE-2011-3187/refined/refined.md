Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-3187:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2011-3187. It includes a request for a CVE ID for a Ruby on Rails vulnerability related to the `X-Forwarded-For` header, and a subsequent confirmation assigning CVE-2011-3187.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for the `X-Forwarded-For` header in Ruby on Rails versions prior to 3.0.6 when handling class C remote addresses. Specifically, the `request.remote_ip` method in `rails/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb` does not properly validate the input.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **IP Spoofing:** Attackers can manipulate the `X-Forwarded-For` header to spoof their IP address.
    *   **Log Injection:** Malicious data can be injected into logs.
    *   **Bypass Security Mechanisms**: The `request.remote_ip` is often used in security checks.  Spoofing the IP bypasses these checks.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation can lead to:
    *   **Persistent XSS:** If `request.remote_ip` is used unsafely in views.
    *   **SQL Injection:** If `request.remote_ip` is used in SQL queries without proper sanitization.
    *   **Data tampering:** Modification of log data, potentially to hide malicious activity.
    *   **Bypassing access control:** If IP-based access control is relied upon.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The primary attack vector is through manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.
    *   An attacker sends a crafted `X-Forwarded-For` header containing malicious input.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:**
    * The attacker can be an external user to a web app.
    * The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    * The attacker needs to be able to modify HTTP headers.
*   **Affected Versions**: Ruby on Rails versions prior to 3.0.6. Rails 3.0.0 and later is not affected.

**Additional Details:**

* The blog post "Ruby on Rails Vulnerability" provides a detailed description of the flaw, including example code and proof-of-concept links.
* The vulnerability is present in the `request.remote_ip` method.
* The issue affects internal web servers with rails web apps (Intranet-Servers).
* A quick fix is suggested: validate that `request.remote_ip` is a valid IP address before using it.

**Summary:**
CVE-2011-3187 is a vulnerability in Ruby on Rails that arises from improper handling of the `X-Forwarded-For` header, allowing attackers to spoof IPs, inject logs, and potentially carry out other attacks like XSS or SQL injection. This issue affected versions prior to 3.0.6.
