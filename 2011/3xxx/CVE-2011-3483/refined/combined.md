| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=737787#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-09-13 05:15:57 UTC  ``` A large loop in the OpenSafety dissector could cause a crash. It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file. This affects versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.1 and has been fixed in version 1.6.2  Reference: <http://www.wireshark.org/security/wnpa-sec-2011-12.html>  This issue affects the versions of wireshark shipped with Fedora-14, Fedora-15 and the upcoming Fedora-16 and has been fixed via the following security advisories:  <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2011-12423> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2011-12403> <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2011-12399>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=737787#c1)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-09-13 05:16:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of wireshark as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=737787#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-14 21:59:54 UTC  ``` This issue was assigned the name [CVE-2011-3484](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3484).   ``` |  |

Crash-only issues are always/typically worth a CVE when it can prevent a
product from working in a security context.  Wireshark monitors network
traffic, sometimes live; therefore, in some reasonable/common usage
scenarios, attackers can cause a crash and prevent network activities from
being detected.

We apply similar logic in forensics and other scenarios.  Therefore a CVE
is needed for both wnpa-sec-2011-12 (crash reading live packets) as well
as wnpa-sec-2011-14 (by only reading a packet trace file) - in the latter,
analysis of a packet trace could be hampered/delayed because the
investigator can't use the product without it crashing.

Wireshark does not get any more "preference" than any other tool, except
indirectly because it gets more attention.

Use CVE-2011-3360 for the above.

Are the below worth assigning CVE ids to? The advisory seems to suggest
they are crash only fixes. Do those deserve CVE IDs? I know we've been
fairly generous with wireshark in the past, but I'm wondering if we need to
draw a line somewhere.
