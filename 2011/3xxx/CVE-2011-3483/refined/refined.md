Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3483:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A buffer exception handling vulnerability exists within Wireshark. Specifically, a malformed capture file could lead to an invalid root `tvbuff` (a data buffer structure used by Wireshark) and cause a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Buffer Handling:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of data buffers when processing malformed packet capture files.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Wireshark does not properly validate the structure or contents of packet capture files, leading to an exception when an invalid file is encountered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the Wireshark application. This could prevent network administrators or security analysts from being able to monitor and analyze network traffic.
*   **Hinder Analysis:** In forensic or incident response scenarios, the crash could prevent the analysis of packet traces, delaying investigation efforts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Packet Capture Files:** An attacker could create a specially crafted, malformed packet trace file and convince a user to open it with Wireshark.
*   **Injected Malformed Packets:** While less direct, an attacker could inject malformed packets onto the network, hoping that someone captures and then attempts to analyze the traffic with vulnerable versions of Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to create or modify packet capture files:**  The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious packet capture file.
*   **Ability to deliver malicious capture file or inject malformed packets:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver the file to the target user or inject malformed packets onto the network being monitored.
*   **No need for special privileges:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening a crafted file and would not require any particular user privilege.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Wireshark versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.1 are vulnerable.
*   **Fixed Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Wireshark version 1.6.2 and later.
*   **Red Hat Enterprise Linux:** The issue did not affect the versions of wireshark shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as bug 6135 in the Wireshark bug tracker.
