  "CVE-2011-3607": {
    "Description": "Integer overflow in the ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, allows local users to gain privileges via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in the `ap_pregsub` function within the `mod_setenvif` module, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can cause a denial of service by crashing the Interstage HTTP Server process. Local attackers can potentially gain privileges by crafting a malicious .htaccess file and HTTP request, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the 'apache' user.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted HTTP request header",
	  "Malicious .htaccess file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the file system to place a crafted .htaccess file, or ability to write arbitrary files to the local filesystem (e.g., via web interface). A remote attacker must send a modified HTTP request."
