# Interstage HTTP Server/ Interstage HTTP Server 2.2: Security Vulnerabilities(CVE-2011-3607/ CVE-2012-3499/ CVE-2012-2687/ CVE-2013-1862). March 19th, 2015

[Notes on using this web page](/global/support/software/security/about.html)

## 1. Description

1. A Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability has been confirmed when the Interstage HTTP Server mod\_setenvif module is used.

   This vulnerability is reported as "CVE-2011-3607".
2. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been confirmed if one of the Interstage HTTP Server modules (mod\_imap, mod\_info, or mod\_status) is used in HTTP response data generation processing.

   This vulnerability is reported as "CVE-2012-3499".
3. A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been confirmed if the Interstage HTTP Server mod\_negotiation module is used in status code 406 error page generation processing.

   This vulnerability is reported as "CVE-2012-2687".
4. A vulnerability where arbitrary commands are executed has been confirmed if the Interstage HTTP Server or Interstage HTTP Server 2.2 mod\_rewrite module is used.

   This vulnerability is reported as "CVE-2013-1862".

   Unless the following conditions apply, however, Interstage HTTP Server is not affected by this vulnerability problem.

   1. "On" was specified for the RewriteEngine directive in the environment definition file (httpd.conf), and
   2. The RewriteLog directive was configured in the environment definition file (httpd.conf), and
   3. A value of 1 or greater was specified for the RewriteLogLevel directive in the environment definition file (httpd.conf).

The security patches shown in 3-2. are provided, and Fujitsu requests that these be applied promptly.

For products for which no security patch is provided, use the workaround shown in 3-3.

## 2. Impact

1. A modified request sent by a remote attacker may cause the Interstage HTTP Server process to crash, resulting in Denial of Service (DoS).
2. By creating a page that exploits the XSS vulnerability of a website (targeted site) operated by Interstage HTTP Server, a malicious user can execute any code on the computer of a user (victim) who accesses this page.

   Additionally, if the victim has set the targeted site as a trusted site, this code may be executed as code of the trusted site.

   Potentially harmful code includes the following:

   * Reading user input
   * Reading/overwriting cookies
   * Forwarding information to a third party
3. Same as "b".
4. By displaying the rewrite log file created based on the modified request sent by the remote attacker on a terminal that has vulnerability related to the escape sequence, any command may be executed using the privileges of that user.

## 3. Affected systems and corresponding action

### 3-1. Affected systems:

GP7000F, PRIMEPOWER, PRIMERGY, GP5000, CELSIUS, AT-compatible machine, PRIMEQUEST, SPARC Enterprise, SPARC M10

### 3-2. Affected products and required patch

   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2687>
4. CVE-2013-1862

   mod\_rewrite.c in the mod\_rewrite module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.x before 2.2.25 writes data to a log file without sanitizing non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.

[## Updates](/.)

This official feed from the Google Workspace team provides essential information about new features and improvements for Google Workspace customers.

## [New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/new-community-features-for-google-chat-and-an-update-currents%20.html "New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents ")

Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Note:**This blog post outlines upcoming changes to Google Currents for Workspace users. For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please [see this post](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/).
### ---

### What's Changing

Last year, we **[announced plans to wind down Currents](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/currents-spaces-migration.html)**, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published [detailed guidance](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13137538) for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for [automated migration of Currents data](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12129320?p=currentsfaq&visit_id=637801097348316846-2249159324&rd=2) to spaces in Google Chat.

We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can [export Currents data using Takeout](https://support.google.com/a/answer/100458) before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.

Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/), so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below: [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s16000/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20(2).png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s2074/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20%282%29.png)
This month, we’re enabling **new ways for organizations to share information** across the enterprise with [announcements in Google Chat](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/announcements-in-google-chat.html). This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.

We’ve already rolled out **new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging** such as [in-line threading](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/in-line-threading-in-Chat-spaces.html) to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and [custom emojis](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/custom-emojis-google-chat.html) to enable fun, personal expression.

We’ve also made it easier for individuals to **discover and join communities of shared interest**. By [searching in Gmail](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/08/chat-spaces-search-in-gmail.html), users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to [invite others to join](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/share-spaces-in-google-chat.html) via link. Last year, we increased [the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/building-larger-spaces-in-google-chat%20.html), and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.

As communities grow, it’s essential to provide **tools for content moderation and data management**. Last year, we introduced [space managers](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/define-and-manage-chat-spaces-space.html), a community lead with [abilities](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) to [moderate conversation](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) and [manage membership](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/improved-membership-management-google-chat-spaces.html), and last year at NEXT, we rolled out [data loss prevention](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/data-loss-prevention-google-chat-generally-available.html) (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.

Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through **integrations with essential third-party apps** such as [Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/how-to-be-more-productive-as-developer-5-app-integrations-for-google-chat-that-can-help.html), [Zendesk and Salesforce](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/release-notes-02-24-2023.html). Many organizations have **built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools**, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet’s Chat app building capabilities later this year.

For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it’s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.

### Who's impacted

Admins and end users
###

### Why it’s important

The transition from Currents to spaces in Google Chat removes a separate, siloed destination and provides organizations with a modern, enterprise-grade experience that reflects how the world is working today. Google Workspace customers use Google Chat to communicate about projects, share organizational updates, and build community.

RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

Issued:
2012-05-07
Updated:
2012-05-07
# RHSA-2012:0543 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Topic

An update for the Apache HTTP Server component for JBoss Enterprise Web
Server 1.0.2 that fixes multiple security issues and one bug is now
available from the Red Hat Customer Portal.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1330 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 as provided from the Red Hat
Customer Portal are advised to apply this update.

## Solution

The References section of this erratum contains a download link (you must
log in to download the update). Before applying the update, back up your
existing JBoss Enterprise Web Server installation (including all
applications and configuration files).

The Apache HTTP Server must be restarted for this update to take effect.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-22 13:44:51 UTC  ``` Vincent Danen 2011-11-02 17:14:55 EDT  It was reported [1] that an integer overflow was found in Apache in the ap_pregsub() function called from mod-setenvif.  When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field.  This would cause ap_pregsub() to overflow the length value in buffer size calculations, leading to the subsequent allocation call of a too-small buffer.  Filling this buffer with user-supplied data will lead to a buffer overflow.  Depending on the input data, this can lead to excessive allocation of server memory (resulting in killed processes due to out-of-memory conditions), invalid memory access when copying large amounts of data (which can lead to a termination of the httpd process), or possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  To trigger this flaw, mod_setenvif must be enabled (the default) and the attacker needs to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server (which, in most cases, would require local access to the file system or some web interface that allows for writing arbitrary files to the local file system, such as for custom .htaccess files).  There is currently no upstream fix, however to work around the problem, disable mod_setenvif.

# RHSA-2012:0128 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0128)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server is a popular web server.

It was discovered that the fix for CVE-2011-3368 (released via
RHSA-2011:1391) did not completely address the problem. An attacker could
bypass the fix and make a reverse proxy connect to an arbitrary server not
directly accessible to the attacker by sending an HTTP version 0.9 request,
or by using a specially-crafted URI. (CVE-2011-3639, CVE-2011-4317)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

All httpd users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the updated
packages, the httpd daemon will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-20 19:13:37 UTC  ``` RMDG partner and independent security consultancy, "Context Information  Security" has made CPNI Response aware of a security vulnerability which  could potentially allow an attacker to gain full internal access to a  network from the internet.  The technique exploits insecurely configured reverse web proxies to gain  access to internal/DMZ systems.  This attack is based on an Apache web server which is using "mod_rewrite"  to proxy web requests internally. Other proxies may suffer from this  issue.  The vulnerability occurs if the Apache configuration file is configured  like this:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) <http://internalserver:80$1> [P]  As opposed to:                  RewriteRule ^(.*) [http://internalserver:80/$1](http://internalserver:80/%241) [P]   It is important for readers to review their reverse proxy configurations  to ensure that the rewrite rules are securely configured and cannot be  abused in such a way that they can be used to compromise internal systems.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-26 11:54:29 UTC  ``` Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases:    <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p>   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:10:49 UTC  ``` This flaw is now public, and has been fixed in svn:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  The full upstream advisory is as follows (noted because it contains mitigation information):  Apache HTTP Server Security Advisory ====================================  Title:       mod_proxy reverse proxy exposure  CVE:         [CVE-2011-3368](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3368) Date:        20111005 Product:     Apache HTTP Server Versions:    httpd 1.3 all versions, httpd 2.x all versions  Description: ============  An exposure was reported affecting the use of Apache HTTP Server in reverse proxy mode.  We would like to thank Context Information Security Ltd for reporting this issue to us.  When using the RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch directives to configure a reverse proxy using a pattern match, it is possible to inadvertently expose internal servers to remote users who send carefully crafted requests.  The server did not validate that the input to the pattern match was a valid path string, so a pattern could expand to an unintended target URL.  For future releases of the Apache HTTP Server, the software will validate the request URI, correcting this specific vulnerability.  The documentation has been updated to reflect the more general risks with pattern matching in a reverse proxy configuration.  Details: ======== A configuration like one of the following examples:    RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]   ProxyPassMatch (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2>  could result in an exposure of internal servers.  A request of the form:    GET @other.example.com/something.png HTTP/1.1  would get translated to a target of:    <http://images.example.com@other.example.com/something.png>  This will cause the proxy to connect to the hostname "other.example.com", as the "images.example.com@" segment would be treated as user credentials when parsing the URL.  This would allow a remote attacker the ability to proxy to hosts other than those expected, which could be a security exposure in some circumstances.  The request-URI string in this example, "@other.example.com/something.png", is not valid according to the HTTP specification, since it neither an absolute URI ("<http://example.com/path>") nor an absolute path ("/path").  For future releases, the server has been patched to reject such requests, instead returning a "400 Bad Request" error.  Actions: ========  Apache HTTPD users should examine their configuration files to determine if they have used an insecure configuration for reverse proxying. Affected users can update their configuration, or apply the patch from:     <http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/patches/apply_to_2.2.21/>  For example, the above RewriteRule could be changed to:    RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png)    [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  to ensure the pattern only matches against paths with a leading "/".   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-10-05 16:12:39 UTC  ``` Created httpd tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 743653](show_bug.cgi?id=743653 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - CVE-2011-3368 httpd: reverse web proxy vulnerability [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-06 09:21:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c1)) > Part of the problem is that httpd documentation was giving a bad example, that > is probably going to get corrected in future upstream releases: >  >   <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/rewrite/flags.html#flag_p> >   RewriteRule (.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) <http://images.example.com$1.$2> [P]  The example was changed to:   RewriteRule /(.*)\.(jpg|gif|png) [http://images.example.com/$1.$2](http://images.example.com/%241.%242) [P]  via:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179283>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-07 15:05:31 UTC  ``` External References:  <http://www.contextis.com/research/blog/reverseproxybypass/>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-10-11 13:40:42 UTC  ``` Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:56:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:1392 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1392.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-10-20 16:57:04 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1391 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1391.html>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=740045#c20)  Vincent Danen    2011-11-15 20:31:34 UTC  ``` The upstream fix for this issue is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1179239>  However that fix is insufficient as it does not handle HTTP 0.9 style requests (as noted via <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=722545#c15>).

### Bug Description

Apache worker on oneric, in server/util.c, function

AP\_DECLARE(char \*) ap\_pregsub(apr\_pool\_t \*p, const char \*input,

                              const char \*source, size\_t nmatch,

                              ap\_regmatch\_t pmatch[])

contains exploitable integer overflow when calculating length of

buffer:

else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm\_so < pmatch[no].rm\_eo) {

            len += pmatch[no].rm\_eo - pmatch[no].rm\_so;

        }

...

dest = dst = apr\_pcalloc(p, len + 1);

Can be triggered by placing .htaccess file on server with module

enabled:

        }

Ubuntu security was informed 20110715, no reply so far. When .htaccess was placed on server, exploitation seems to be possible on nonexec segments using 2 concurrent client requests over net. With return-oriented-programming with 3 blocks from (xchg eax/esp+ret; pop eax+ret, pop ebx,ecx,edx+ret; cd 0x80) should do the trick, but currently stability is not good enough. The main target to control IP is

where esi is user controllable and can be made pointing to other user-data blocks. The symlink attack from

<http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace/> (issue number coming soon) might be useful to get apache memory layout from /proc/<pid>/maps, a issue to suspend httpd when serving pipes ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/811417](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apache2/%2Bbug/811417)) might be helpful with timing attack, but this not yet proofed.

Sent mail to <email address hidden> 2011-07-15 (no reply) and again today:

Dear Apache Httpd Security Team,

It seems possible to execute arbitrary via the bug reported

2011-07-15. Since this requires a crafted .htaccess file on the host,

this might not be a too big issue.

See

<http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/>

for first draft of multi-thread exploit (url not published elsewhere).

Currently I'm trying to get more stable code executing using the

stop-regex approach and just a single thread.

I checked the reporting guidelines again today and found, that there is a different security contact mail address mentioned. I'm not sure, if something has changed at apache website or I just picked up an dead address. Resending to <email address hidden>

### Bug Description

Apache worker on oneric, in server/util.c, function

AP\_DECLARE(char \*) ap\_pregsub(apr\_pool\_t \*p, const char \*input,

                              const char \*source, size\_t nmatch,

                              ap\_regmatch\_t pmatch[])

contains exploitable integer overflow when calculating length of

buffer:

else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm\_so < pmatch[no].rm\_eo) {

            len += pmatch[no].rm\_eo - pmatch[no].rm\_so;

        }

...

dest = dst = apr\_pcalloc(p, len + 1);

Can be triggered by placing .htaccess file on server with module

enabled:

else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm\_so < pmatch[no].rm\_eo) {

            len = pmatch[no].rm\_eo - pmatch[no].rm\_so;

            memcpy(dst, source + pmatch[no].rm\_so, len);

Ubuntu security was informed 20110715, no reply so far. When .htaccess was placed on server, exploitation seems to be possible on nonexec segments using 2 concurrent client requests over net. With return-oriented-programming with 3 blocks from (xchg eax/esp+ret; pop eax+ret, pop ebx,ecx,edx+ret; cd 0x80) should do the trick, but currently stability is not good enough. The main target to control IP is

where esi is user controllable and can be made pointing to other user-data blocks. The symlink attack from

<http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace/> (issue number coming soon) might be useful to get apache memory layout from /proc/<pid>/maps, a issue to suspend httpd when serving pipes ([https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2/+bug/811417](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apache2/%2Bbug/811417)) might be helpful with timing attack, but this not yet proofed.

Sent mail to <email address hidden> 2011-07-15 (no reply) and again today:

Dear Apache Httpd Security Team,

It seems possible to execute arbitrary via the bug reported

2011-07-15. Since this requires a crafted .htaccess file on the host,

this might not be a too big issue.

See

<http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/>

for first draft of multi-thread exploit (url not published elsewhere).

Currently I'm trying to get more stable code executing using the

stop-regex approach and just a single thread.

I checked the reporting guidelines again today and found, that there is a different security contact mail address mentioned. I'm not sure, if something has changed at apache website or I just picked up an dead address. Resending to <email address hidden>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[g+](https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/ "google+")
# Background

The Apache HTTP Server is an open-source HTTP server for modern
operating systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS/X and
Netware. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient
and extensible server that provides HTTP services observing the
current HTTP standards. Apache has been the most popular web server
on the Internet since April of 1996.

# Problem Description

During routine testing, an integer overflow was found in
apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 in the function ap\_pregsub called
from mod-setenvif. The issue affects all versions from 2.0.x
to 2.0.64 and 2.2.x to 2.2.21, not depending on the mode of
operation (worker, prefork, ..).
When a header field is mangled using *SetEnvIf*, the new
environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the
submitted header field. When *ap\_pregsub* from *server/util.c*
calculates the buffer size using

else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm\_so < pmatch[no].rm\_eo) {
len += pmatch[no].rm\_eo - pmatch[no].rm\_so;
}

the length value overflows and is used in a subsequent allocation
call of buffer too small:

dest = dst = apr\_pcalloc(p, len + 1);

The subsequent filling of the buffer with user-supplied data leads
to buffer overflow. Even without overflowing, the allocation of
significant amounts of server memory for excessivly large environment
variables should be considered a problem also.

# Impact

Depending on the input data, exploitation of this issue leads
to:

* allocation of large quantities of server memory, killing processes
  due to out-of-memory conditions or reducing system performance to
  crawl due to massive swapping.
* invalid memory access when copying more than 4GB of data
  into the much smaller buffer. Since the loop copying the data uses
  only stack and libc-heap, not the apr pool, for source and destination
  addresses, copy process is linear, starting at low address and
  pool is separated by unaccessible memory pages for protection
  on linux. Usually this will only cause termination
  of the apache process, which is restarted automatically. The impact
  is increased system load and DOS-condition while under attack.
* At least with multi-threaded server (worker), arbitrary code
  execution is proven, on single-threaded varians, the use of crafted
  stop-sequences might allow code execution even on these systems.
  On many systems ASLR will reduce the efficiency of the attack,
  but even with ASLR enabled, the automatic restart of processes
  allows to probe for all possible mappings of libc. An attacker,
  that has already access to another account on the machen, might
  be able to use
  [ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace](../ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace/)
  to learn the memory map of the process, thus having the posibility
  to reach nearly 100% efficiency.

To trigger this issue, mod\_setenvif must be enabled and the
attacker has to be able to place a crafted *.htaccess* file
on the server. Since the triggering of the exploit might depend
on a *magic header field*, the malicious *.htaccess*
might be placed as backdoor in web-content .zip files or could
be stored dormant on the server until activation by the
corresponding magic request.

# Workaround

On workaround is to disable the module when not needed. Another one
is to disable use of *.htaccess* on all user-modificable locations
by setting *AllowOverride None* on all corresponding directories.

# Solution

The fix for the integer overflow in ap\_pregsub (server/util.c,)
is tivial, e.g.

oldlen=len=0
else if (no < nmatch && pmatch[no].rm\_so < pmatch[no].rm\_eo) {
len += pmatch[no].rm\_eo - pmatch[no].rm\_so;
// Return NULL on error
if(len<oldlen) return(NULL);
}

Apart from the overflow, a discussion on reasonable sizes for
environment variables should be started to deal with the memory
consumption problem. Without limits, another problematic section
is in ap\_pregsub (server/util.c,) should be fixed also. At the
moment, the return value from from apr\_pcalloc is not checked,
leading to a NULL-pointer dereference. Fix

dest = dst = apr\_pcalloc(p, len + 1);
if(!dest) return(NULL);

# Starting Point

During routine testing, an integer overflow in apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19
mod-setenvif was found. The crash occured when mangling request
headers using a crafted [.htaccess](SingleThread-htaccess)-file.
The broken code was ap\_pregsub in server/util.c, where the buffer
size of a new header field could overflow, the value was then used
for memory allocation. When copying data to the buffer an, overwrite
of the an apr (apache portable runtime) memory-pool boundaries
occured, similar to standard heap buffer overflows.

# Outline of Exploit

The main goals creating the exploit were:

* Exploit has to be triggerable via HTTP GET requests only
* Exploit data has to be 0-byte free to have valid HTTP-protocol
* No alternative way of heap-spraying is used, e.g. GET + content-length.
  All variants I knew of had much too low efficiency
* Use libc for ROP, although all libc-addresses start with 0-byte,
  which cannot be sent via HTTP
* Rely only on libc address guess, but not heap/stack address guess,
  unless guess could be made nearly 100% reliable
* Use the already open HTTP-connections and turn them into command
  connections on the fly
* Have exploit in less than 256 bytes

Two different exploit layouts were developed. The
[first one](#ExploitationAttempt1) used multiple
threads, so that one was overwriting the data of the second
thread before hitting the end of the memory area. Precise
timing was essential to get shell access.

The [second one](#ExploitationAttempt2) used a
more crafted substitution expression, stopping the copy in
a single thread by modifying the regular expression currently
processed in the thread. Since there is race condition involved,
this exploit was far more reliable than the first one.

# First Exploitation Attempt

Due to the afore-mentioned requirements, an exploit with about
30% success rate for apache2-mpm-worker 2.2.19 on ubuntu oneiric 32bit
was developed with the purpose to learn alternative programming
techniques in a hands-on approach. To get hold of crucial apache
data structures, the programs outlined here tried to exploit
concurrent access to already corrupted data structures before
the otherwise inevitable apache crash. Due to the additional

## Step 0:

Create an [.htaccess](3Thread-htaccess)-file
that will copy more than 4GB of data into a 16MB buffer. Usually
ap\_pregsub will copy data to the buffer, overwriting the whole
apr-pool memory until copy hits the upper mapped memory boundary
(see second while-loop in ap\_pregsub from server/util.c). Since
the .htaccess will cause ap\_pregsub to fill the whole heap with
repeating copies of the HTTP-header block, this will also circumvent
the heap randomization. The heap data will span such a large
portion of heap, so that a pointer to heap will always hit one
of the copies.

## Step 1:

To get a chance to execute code, ap\_pregsub
copy process has to be stopped without SEGV. Two ways are possible:

* The copy process also overwrites the regular expression, that
  is defining which data is currently copied. By overwriting the
  expression with a stop sequence ($9$9..), execution will leave
  ap\_pregsub function without SEGV, but will continue using the
  corrupted heap. Since there is no function pointer call near,
  most of the execution branches will lead to crash. Just one
  path allows to construct an endless loop loop in apr\_palloc.
* Terminate the overwriting process before it reaches the
  end using another apache thread and the already corrupted heap.
  Since data copy is quite fast, the race between the two apache
  threads is very hard to make.

To extend the window of opportunity, an ap\_pregsub-stop
sequence is sent first using <SendTrigger-SingleThreadAprPallocEndlessLoop.c>.
This will add a 16MB race buffer, slow down the server by sending
one thread into endless loop, both helps to extend the race window
in step 3 to 100ms on a 800MHz CPU, which would also be sufficient
for remote TCP exploitation.

## Step 2:

Send traffic, that will make apache use one
function pointer more frequently. For reproducibility it was
important, to send data, that will make apache loop just over
a very limited part of the whole apache binary code. Otherwise
a wide variety of crashes at different code positions were
observed. The <RequestFlood.c>
program will open multiple connections to apache, send
*GET /AAA* and then continue to send *AAAA* every
100ms, thus making the URL data on server side longer in
each iteration. Due to the long time between the sending
of GET header bytes, it is quite likely, that the heap
is overwritten by thread started in step 3 while the current
thread is in apr\_socket\_timeout\_set (srclib/apr/network\_io/unix/sockopt.c).
apr\_socket\_timeout\_set has also one other advantage, it
will pick up the *sock* pointer from corrupted heap
and write the timeout value to that location, thus giving
the opportunity to write the first MSB 0-byte and using
that value as function pointer later on in ap\_get\_brigade
from server/util\_filter.c. The RequestFlood program has
to be running before sending the remote shell trigger in
step 3.

## Step 3:

Send a trigger request, that will overwrite
the apr-heap, similar to the request from step 1, but without
any stop sequence. The HTTP request data will be overwrite the
heap, thus the threads from step 2 can pick it up. This request
contains also the remote shell code, but there are a few obstacles
blocking code execution:

* Stack is not overwritten at all, so standard ROP cannot work
* Heap is overwritten with 0-byte free data, but ROP usually
  needs quite a few 0-bytes. This makes it impossible to use any
  *test xxx; jz yyyy;* branches or use small positive array
  indices.
* Heap is not executable

Workarounds for these problems are collected in
<SendTrigger-RemoteShell.c>:

* **No stack control:** Jump to sscanf in a way, so that
  sscanf will overwrite some values on stack, including a return
  address. This is made easier since sscanf has an integer overflow
  when parsing the offsets for argument skipping syntax. Hence
  it is possible, to access values above and below the current
  stack position using offsets near 2^30, as seen in the scan
  string *%1073741815$32c%3s%4hx%1x%1x%1073741815$7s*.
  sscanf was used to add some 0-bytes on heap also.
* **No full stack control:** sscanf stack editing is painful
  and eats up a lot of payload space. So use the return address
  to jump to *pop esp; ret* to have stack pointing to heap.
* **Non-executable heap:** Jump to mprotect and make heap
  executable
* **Avoid back-connect:** Loop over open file descriptors
  and fork a shell for every descriptor. See
  <ForkPayload.c> for assembly code.
  The code uses the return address from mprotect to calculate
  dup2, fork, execv addresses, thus avoiding need for some more
  0-bytes. The whole remote shell loop code is just 93 bytes.

The trigger program takes the libc start address as argument.
If it is possible to place a symbolic link to /proc/self/maps
on the host, simple renaming of the link will defeat the
NoFollowSymlinks options and allow to read the offsets from
/proc/self/maps, thus defeating the ASLR (
[more](../ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace/)). If not
known, address has to be guessed using different values in
*SendTrigger-RemoteShell --LibcMapPos 0xxxxxx*.

## Step 4:

To reduce the code size, the remote command
connection does not return stdout. To get stdout, the first
command sent to remote should be *exec 1>&0*.
Since <SendTrigger-RemoteShell.c>
does not implement a nice shell gui, one can also telnet
to apache before starting step 3, the telnet connection
will turn to remote shell connection while open.

# Second Exploitation Attempt

In contrast to the first attempt, this exploit overwrites the
currently interpreted regex with a crafted stop sequence to terminate
buffer overwriting before reaching the upper heap limit. In contrast
to the first attempt, this program requires only a single apache
thread to give remote shell and could also be used to take over
process on non-mpm-worker apache servers. Steps:

## Step 0:

Create an
[.htaccess](SingleThread-htaccess)-file in /var/www,
that will copy more than 4GB of data into a 16MB buffer. The
new variable value expression is designed in such way, that when
apache is copying data to the destination buffer and overwriting
the variable definition data itself, the new definition corresponds
to a variable size of zero. Hence the buffer-overflowing copy process
is stopped as soon as the variable definition data is overwritten.

## Step 1:

Mix up heap data to get a layout favorable to
our tasks. This can be done by just sending a normal GET request
for an existing file via a Keep-Alive connection and using that
connection to send the trigger afterwards.

## Step 2:

The most stable server code/data flow leading
to successful exploitation would be one using a function pointer
near to the point where the overflow begun. Otherwise the exploit
code will depend also on other modules loaded or platform configuration
parameters (the first attempt used a function pointer after mod\_setenvif
processing was completed). To archive that, apr\_table\_setn is used.
The function usually would store the new variable value to a
hash-table. Since it is operating on an overwritten table data
structure, it can be used to create 0-bytes at appropriate locations
and finally trigger an invalid allocation. Thus is leading to
apr\_palloc to call an abort-function and this function pointer
can be controlled.

At the moment of this function call, only the function destination
can be controlled, the content of all other registers cannot be
used to call a suitable target function directly. Since the stack
was not overwritten, standard ROP methods do not work. As a workaround,
a part of the \_IO\_file\_seekoff function can be used:

0x00736ff7 <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+407>: mov 0x8(%ebp),%ecx
0x00736ffa <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+410>: mov 0x14(%ebp),%edx
0x00736ffd <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+413>: mov 0x4c(%ecx),%eax
0x00737000 <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+416>: mov %esi,0x4(%esp)
0x00737004 <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+420>: mov %edx,0xc(%esp)
0x00737008 <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+424>: mov %edi,0x8(%esp)
0x0073700c <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+428>: mov %ecx,(%esp)
0x0073700f <\_IO\_file\_seekoff+431>: call \*0x40(%eax)

At the end of the sequence the stack will contain one
pointer of our choice, the value 1 and the call will go to
a controllable destination. That stack layout matches the
function call of \_\_libc\_dlopen\_mode, the internal symbol for
dlload(). A sample program to archive this is
<TriggerRemoteShell.c>.

## Step 3:

Since the attack assumed, that an attacker could
place an .htaccess file on the server, it is also sensible to
assume, that he could put a second file there also. This second
file should be a shared library loaded by the dlload call. The
library contains the *\_init* symbol, this function is called
during loading of the library, hence activating the exploit code.
The library itself is not very special, it just tries to identify
all open socket connections using a *getsockopts* call and
forks a shell for every connection, e.g.
<ExploitLib.c>. When the library is loaded,
the open connection of TriggerRemoteShell.c is turned to a remote
shell. Since apache server on ubuntu oneiric uses ASLR and the
exploit needs the correct libc memory locations, the
TriggerRemoteShell program can be started with the correct libc
mapping information for testing. In real world examples, one
might guess or try to get access to the /proc/[pid]/maps file
before sending the exploit using an
[apache symlink timerace](../ApacheNoFollowSymlinkTimerace/).

With a different payload library, the lower-privileged www-data
process can modify the shared memory scoreboard data in a way to
trigger an invalid free/gcc-lib load in the root-priv master process,
see [ApacheScoreboardInvalidFreeOnShutdown](../ApacheScoreboardInvalidFreeOnShutdown/).

# Thinking About Security

Due to my limited programming skills, getting this first and
far-from-good POC exploit was not quite easy. Some apache, libc,
linux software design decisions made it simpler or easier for me:

* apache: Common use of function pointers in apache. Function pointers
  allow implementation of apache as a flexible, modularized web
  server, but simplify arbitrary code execution.
* apache: Parts of the apache code have no checks on reasonable sizes or
  return values, hence allowing abnormally large data structures, e.g.
  for heap spraying or to cause resource starvation.
* apache: apr\_palloc is quite fast but uses very simple data
  structure. Once one *apr\_memnode\_t* structure is under
  control, apr\_palloc can be used to introduce 0-bytes when
  first\_avail is incremented by a known value, which was the
  only other way besides apr\_socket\_timeout\_set to add 0-bytes
* All lib-addresses start with 0-byte: The whole POC would
  be much smaller, if library addresses did not contain 0-bytes.
  This advantage is only relevant for small applications, where
  all libraries and modules fit into the lower 16MB
* libc: sscanf accepts negative arg pointer offsets in arg
  skipping syntax, thus allowing to use stack addresses before
  and after current stack position. What is that feature good for?
* linux: No stack-start randomization on byte granularity,
  allowing sscanf stack editing by modifying only the lowest
  byte of an address
* linux: mprotect syscall does not force unused protection mode
  flag bits to be 0, making it quite possible, that during ROP
  a stack value has the right bits set (x executable).

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2405-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Stefan Fritsch
February 06, 2012                      <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : apache2
Vulnerability  : multiple issues
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-3607 CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317
                 CVE-2012-0031 CVE-2012-0053

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:

CVE-2011-3607:

  An integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
  files.

CVE-2011-3368 CVE-2011-3639 CVE-2011-4317:

  The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
  arbitrary server. The could allow the attacker to access internal
  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.

  The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
  issue.

  Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
  configuration

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  <http://internal-host$1>

  is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
  configurations:

    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  <http://internal-host$1>
    ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  [http://internal-host/$1](http://internal-host/%241)

CVE-2012-0031:

  An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
  the impact of other vulnerabilities.

CVE-2012-0053:

  The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
  expose "httpOnly" cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.

This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c0)  Ramon de C Valle    2011-12-22 13:44:51 UTC  ``` Vincent Danen 2011-11-02 17:14:55 EDT  It was reported [1] that an integer overflow was found in Apache in the ap_pregsub() function called from mod-setenvif.  When a header field is mangled using SetEnvIf, the new environment variable data can be multiples of the size of the submitted header field.  This would cause ap_pregsub() to overflow the length value in buffer size calculations, leading to the subsequent allocation call of a too-small buffer.  Filling this buffer with user-supplied data will lead to a buffer overflow.  Depending on the input data, this can lead to excessive allocation of server memory (resulting in killed processes due to out-of-memory conditions), invalid memory access when copying large amounts of data (which can lead to a termination of the httpd process), or possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  To trigger this flaw, mod_setenvif must be enabled (the default) and the attacker needs to be able to place a crafted .htaccess file on the server (which, in most cases, would require local access to the file system or some web interface that allows for writing arbitrary files to the local file system, such as for custom .htaccess files).  There is currently no upstream fix, however to work around the problem, disable mod_setenvif.  [1] <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-12 10:06:25 UTC  ``` This issue was originally tracked with [CVE-2011-4415](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-4415) via [bug #750935](show_bug.cgi?id=750935 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2011-4415 httpd: SetEnvIf resource exhaustion").  Patch for this issue was added upstream to trunk (future 2.4.x httpd versions) via following commit:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1198940>  That fix is not applicable to older httpd versions, such as 2.2.x.  There still on-going upstream discussion on how to address this in older httpd versions:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.devel/46260>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c2)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-24 14:49:21 UTC  ``` There are still no follow up on this discussion.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2012-01-26 14:46:10 UTC  ``` Following fix is already committed in upstream SVN for 2.2.x:   <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1227280>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c4)  Ramon de C Valle    2012-01-27 09:02:09 UTC  ``` Theese are the only exploits/reproducers currently available/released for this: <http://www.halfdog.net/Security/2011/ApacheModSetEnvIfIntegerOverflow/DemoExploit.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-13 20:34:26 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2012:0128 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0128.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-21 21:58:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0323 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0323.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 18:48:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2  Via RHSA-2012:0543 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0543.html>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=769844#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-05-07 19:17:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2012:0542 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0542.html>   ``` |  |

## Synopsis

Moderate: httpd security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0542)

## Topic

Updated httpd packages that fix multiple security issues and one bug are
now available for JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 5 and 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The Apache HTTP Server ("httpd") is the namesake project of The Apache
Software Foundation.

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the
request URI for proxied requests. In certain configurations, if a reverse
proxy used the ProxyPassMatch directive, or if it used the RewriteRule
directive with the proxy flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy
connect to an arbitrary server, possibly disclosing sensitive information
from internal web servers not directly accessible to the attacker.
(CVE-2011-3368)

It was discovered that mod\_proxy\_ajp incorrectly returned an "Internal
Server Error" response when processing certain malformed HTTP requests,
which caused the back-end server to be marked as failed in configurations
where mod\_proxy was used in load balancer mode. A remote attacker could
cause mod\_proxy to not send requests to back-end AJP (Apache JServ
Protocol) servers for the retry timeout period or until all back-end
servers were marked as failed. (CVE-2011-3348)

The httpd server included the full HTTP header line in the default error
page generated when receiving an excessively long or malformed header.
Malicious JavaScript running in the server's domain context could use this
flaw to gain access to httpOnly cookies. (CVE-2012-0053)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way httpd performed substitutions in regular expressions. An
attacker able to set certain httpd settings, such as a user permitted to
override the httpd configuration for a specific directory using a
".htaccess" file, could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process or,
possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the "apache" user.
(CVE-2011-3607)

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the httpd mod\_log\_config
module. In configurations where cookie logging is enabled, a remote
attacker could use this flaw to crash the httpd child process via an HTTP
request with a malformed Cookie header. (CVE-2012-0021)

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled child process status information.
A malicious program running with httpd child process privileges (such as a
PHP or CGI script) could use this flaw to cause the parent httpd process to
crash during httpd service shutdown. (CVE-2012-0031)

Red Hat would like to thank Context Information Security for reporting the
CVE-2011-3368 issue.

This update also fixes the following bug:

* The fix for CVE-2011-3192 provided by the RHSA-2011:1329 update

introduced a regression in the way httpd handled certain Range HTTP header
values. This update corrects this regression. (BZ#749071)

All users of JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0.2 should upgrade to these
updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.
After installing the updated packages, users must restart the httpd
service for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>
