# Digital Bond Archives

In 2018 we moved the digitalbond.com content to dale-peterson.com for consulting and public speaking and [s4xevents.com](https://s4xevents.com) for S4 content. The old site hosted almost 2000 blog entries. This was before social media, and we were putting out about 7 per week. We have moved the still pertinent half of those to this site, and you can see them archived by year.

Most of the research projects have been dorment for a number of years including the Quickdraw ICS IDS signatures, Bandolier Security Audit Files, Portaledge SCADA SIEM, Redpoint Nmap NSE Scripts, PLC Honeynet, Basecamp Metasploit Modules and more. Now that there is a market for ICS security products these proof of concept research has served its purpose. Some of the remnants of these products are available on Github.
