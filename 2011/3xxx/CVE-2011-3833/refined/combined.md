					This module combines two separate issues within Support Incident Tracker (<= 3.65)
				application to upload arbitrary data and thus execute a shell. The two issues exist

				The first vulnerability exposes the upload dir used to store attachments.
				The second vulnerability allows arbitrary file upload since there is no
				validation function to prevent from uploading any file type.
				Authentication is required to exploit both vulnerabilities.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Support Incident Tracker multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#576355

Original Release Date: 2011-12-02 | Last Revised: 2011-12-02

---

### Overview

Support Incident Tracker (or SiT!) version 3.65, and possibly earlier versions, contain multiple vulnerabilities including; malicious file uploads, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.

### Description

| According to the [SiT! website](http://sitracker.org/):  *"Support Incident Tracker (or SiT!) is a Free Software/Open Source (GPL) web based application which uses PHP and MySQL for tracking technical support calls/emails (also commonly known as a 'Help Desk' or 'Support Ticket System')."*SiT! is susceptible to multiple attacks, including; malicious file uploads, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and cross-site request forgery.[**CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/434.html)The incident\_attachments.php script does not filter the attachment's extension properly. An attacker may upload any file to the web server and have it run with the privileges of the web service. This vulnerability could be used to upload a PHP shell which may be used as a backdoor. The upload file path is structured in the following way: /attachments-{hash}/{incident ID}/{file ID}-{file name}.{extension}. An attacker would need user access to the website, as well as, brute forcing the attachments folder path. An attacker has two options to retrieve the folder path. The attacker could brute force the default attachments folder name because of a weak generation algorithm or the attacker could use the move\_uploaded\_file.php script to generate an error message that will include the folder path.The ftp\_upload\_file.php script is also vulnerable. An attacker may be able to upload any file to the web server and have it run with the privileges of the web service if they can guess the folder path.[**CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)The incident\_attachments.php script is vulnerable to SQL injection. The attachment file name is not properly sanitized. An attacker may exploit this flaw to execute queries against the database.[**CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')**](http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html)The incident\_attachments.php script is vulnerable to XSS.
