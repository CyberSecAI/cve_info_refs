Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a change in the behavior of the `is_a()` function in PHP 5.3.7. Previously, `is_a()` only accepted objects as its first argument. In 5.3.7, it started accepting strings as the first argument, interpreting them as class names. This change, combined with the fact that `is_a()` now triggers the `__autoload()` function, introduced the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintended Autoload Trigger:** The `is_a()` function, when called with a string as the first argument, now triggers the `__autoload()` function. This was not the intended behavior and broke backward compatibility.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `__autoload()`:** If a vulnerable `__autoload()` function is used, it can be exploited by passing a string as the class name argument that includes a remote URL and including it using `include` or similar functions. If `allow_url_include` or `allow_url_fopen` is enabled in php.ini, this allows the attacker to include and execute remote code on the server.
*  **Incorrect Usage with PEAR:** Libraries like PEAR's DB_DataObject and HTML_Template_Flexy use `is_a()` to check the type of variables. The change caused these libraries to trigger autoloading unexpectedly and can result in errors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By controlling the string passed as the first argument to `is_a()` (indirectly through `__autoload()`), an attacker can force the server to include and execute arbitrary code from a remote location. This can lead to complete server compromise, data breaches, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input:** An attacker crafts a string that, when passed to `is_a()` (indirectly through `__autoload()`), will result in a remote file being included and executed. This could involve uploading a file that will then be used as input or directly providing the crafted string through a vulnerable function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Trigger `is_a()` with Crafted Input:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the arguments passed to the `is_a()` function and have an existing vulnerable autoloader present.
*  **`allow_url_include` or `allow_url_fopen` Enabled:** For the remote code execution to succeed, the `allow_url_include` or `allow_url_fopen` directive in PHP's configuration must be enabled.
*  **Vulnerable `__autoload()` Function:** A custom or default `__autoload()` function that doesn't properly validate the class name and includes it directly is required for successful RCE.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in PHP 5.3.7 and 5.3.8.
*   The issue was resolved by reverting the change in `is_a()` behavior for the 5.3 branch, while keeping the new behavior in 5.4. A new function `is_class_of` was introduced for those who wanted to have autoloading enabled in a similar function, and `is_a()` also now throws a warning when not called with an object.
*   The fix involved preventing `is_a()` from triggering `__autoload()` when a string is given as the first argument in the 5.3 series.
