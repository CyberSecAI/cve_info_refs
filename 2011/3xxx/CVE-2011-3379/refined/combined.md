The first argument can be a class name, what will be  loaded only on calling this function.  ``` **[2011-08-22 09:15 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** ``` 1) The underlying implementation is shared between is_a and is_subclass_of. 2) Previously, strings as first argument was not permitted by is_a but was for is_subclass_of, 3) is_subclass_of always triggered autoload in such cases. 4) Following a fix from Dmitry, the underlying implementation now allows a string as first argument for is_a as well.  Conclusion: it is now consistent, but if you wrongly used is_a with a string before, it now triggers autoload because it actually accepts it.  ``` **[2011-08-22 10:12 UTC] [zeev@php.net](//people.php.net/zeev)** ``` Discussed with Dmitry, the current functionality appears to be correct.  is_a('foo', 'bar') *can* be true even if class foo isn't loaded, and we'll only  know that if we try to load 'foo'.  This is different from is_a($obj, 'non_existent_class'), which we can resolve as  'false' in case non_existent_class isn't loaded without trying to load it (there  can't be an instance of a class that doesn't exist).  ``` **[2011-08-22 10:29 UTC] [kalle@php.net](//people.php.net/kalle)** ``` Zeev, although the functionality might appear as it should be then we should not make sudden changes like that in the middle of a stable branch, we should patch up 5.3 and keep the behaviour in 5.4 if its indeed intended atleast to comply with previous versions.  The fix for 5.3 is simple, attached  ``` **[2011-08-22 10:30 UTC] [kalle@php.net](//people.php.net/kalle)** ``` The following patch has been added/updated:  Patch Name: bug55475 Revision:   1314009019 URL:        <https://bugs.php.net/patch-display.php?bug=55475&patch=bug55475&revision=1314009019>  ``` **[2011-08-22 11:00 UTC] [dmitry@php.net](//people.php.net/dmitry)** ``` Before the patch, is_a() didn't accept string as the first argument at all, so it always returned "false" and never triggered __autoload(). The proposed patch didn't revert to original behavior. It just disables autoloading and may lead to wrong result.  class a {} class b extends a {} var_dump(is_a("b", "a")); // it was false before 5.3.7, now it's true  I would say that the old behaviour was wrong, especially because "instanceof" and is_subclass_of() already implemented support for string arguments.  ``` **[2011-08-22 13:31 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** ``` It seems correct to me as well to trigger autoload in this case. It does and  always did so for is_subclass_of(), I don't see any reason for a condition of  "subclasses_only" to yes or no trigger the autoload.  ``` **[2011-08-22 13:41 UTC] [kalle@php.net](//people.php.net/kalle)** ``` I'm not arguing that the new behaviour is wrong, I believe it is the desired too but I don't agree to break BC in the middle of a stable release series nor as much as I would like to myself to achieve the right behaviour.  ``` **[2011-08-22 14:27 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** ``` But what BC break are you talking about exactly?  It went from not-working (returning always false for strings as first argument)  to working with autoload.  ``` **[2011-08-22 14:40 UTC] [kalle@php.net](//people.php.net/kalle)** ``` I'm talking about the usual procedure we have about changing behaviour, a function suddenly returns the oppersite of what it used to in the middle of a stable series is very unlike to do, even for PHP.  I knnow it went from not working to working, but I don't on the fact that such a commonly used function will change behaviour like that. What we should do is to make a big fat warning in the migration guide for 5.3.x -> 5.4.x about it, and in the manual.  It would be the same if we changed substr() to be case insensitive in the middle of a release series, lets just not venture in such dark corners.  ``` **[2011-08-22 14:44 UTC] [kalle@php.net](//people.php.net/kalle)** ``` ... the behaviour I'm talking about is obvious the return value and the fact that the autoloader now is called.  ``` **[2011-08-22 14:49 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** ``` Well, we have 3 options here:  1) keep it like it is since 5.3.7 2) reverting it to how it worked before 5.3.7 3) change it even more to not use autoload, so that it neither works like <5.3.6 nor 5.3.7  Apparently through your proposed fix you're advocating for (3). If so, I can't see how it would improve the situation in  any way.  Personally, given that the BC change is minimal, and that we're only adding functionality, (1) seems fine. Correct code existing before 5.3.6 will work just fine anyway.  ``` **[2011-08-22 15:46 UTC] [johannes@php.net](//people.php.net/johannes)** ``` is_a()'s first argument is documented to be an object. If called with a string, following the documentation, I would actually expect a "Warning: is_a() expects parameter 1 to be object, string given" and return NULL.  That aside and looking at the actual behavior: Previously is_a() could be used to check whether the parameter is an object AND of a specific type in one go. This can't be done anymore. In $a = "test"; is_a($a, "foo"); test might be an existing class and might be of type foo. Now people have to do is_object() && is_a().  I don't like having such behavior change in bug fix versions as I don't like going back and forth which is annoying for documentation and confusing for users. I would love to keep it out of 5.3.8 to have that as low risk quick release for the hash issue. Which means a rollback to the old way is even harder to do. (two versions with the new behavior out)  ``` **[2011-08-22 18:36 UTC] [stas@php.net](//people.php.net/stas)** ``` This is not a bug. If first argument is a string, it is interpreted as a class  name and autoloader is called for it. Actually, IIRC, one the reasons why is_a was  un-deprecated is that it can work with strings.  ``` **[2011-08-22 19:17 UTC] mads at gartneriet dot dk** ``` Maybe not a bug, but it is behaving different ind 5.3.7 than in the previous versions, which makes some of the code from PEAR that i use, give errors.  ``` **[2011-08-22 21:46 UTC] [colder@php.net](//people.php.net/colder)** ``` What code? Do you have some example?  ``` **[2011-08-23 05:17 UTC] mads at gartneriet dot dk** ``` DB_DataObject uses is_a() to check if a variable is both an object and an instance of a particular object. PEAR::isError() does too.  This just gives warnings in my code, and I could of course easily fix these two places in my local pear-code. But then it will bite me the next time I upgrade those packages from PEAR.  ``` **[2011-08-23 06:26 UTC] alan at akbkhome dot com** ``` From the manual.  "Returns TRUE if the object is of this class or has this class as one of its  parents, FALSE otherwise."  note the "FALSE otherwise" ...  Defiantly a bug..  ``` **[2011-08-23 08:25 UTC] alan at akbkhome dot com** ``` @stas - the point of un-depreciating and working with a string was the second  argument, not the first one.   eg.  is_a($something, 'might_be_not_loaded_class')  rather than $something instanceof might_be_not_loaded_class  ``` **[2011-08-23 14:24 UTC] jha dot rajeev at gmail dot com** ``` This also affects HTML_Template_Flexy pear package that uses is_a to check  returned object against PEAR_Error class. No matter what behavior is right it  looks broken to me because I am patching this pear packages files right now!  ``` **[2011-08-24 01:59 UTC] alan at akbkhome dot com** ``` For reference:  The workaround is to do this   if (is_a($a, 'B')) {  becomes  if (is_object($a) && is_a($a, 'B')) {  ``` **[2011-08-24 05:16 UTC] jha dot rajeev at gmail dot com** ``` I have a question re. the correct behavior of custom __autoload() functions when  called from is_a() in 5.3.7. How do we handle/report missing classes? is is_a()  prepared to handle any sort of exceptions or does it assume that __autoload will  return TRUE/FALSE only?  what if I just did something like is_a("",ABCD)?  ``` **[2011-08-26 10:24 UTC] kkaminski at itens dot pl** ``` +1 for reverting change in 5.3 branch and implementing it in 5.4 (or giving up as it really CHANGES BEHAVIOR) Currently __autoload throws Exceptions to break code execution on some frameworks. This is clean solution as if developer makes a typo, code still can handle missing class and for instance - display a dedicated error report.  Unfortunately, with your latest 'fix' all PEAR packages are now broken on frameworks with __autoload + exceptions - due to isError implementation.  Are you really sure is it MY duty to rewrite / repatch all code (external) code to work around your 'fix' ? How I am supposed to handle missing classes in this case? With exceptions I can catch everything and handle myself. Whats the other way?  ``` **[2011-08-29 07:15 UTC] [tyrael@php.net](//people.php.net/tyrael)** ``` "note the "FALSE otherwise" ..."  note "if the object" ...  Tyrael  ``` **[2011-09-07 06:30 UTC] vchernoivan at gmail dot com** ``` I guess it is no use to argue if the behaviuor is correct or not, or how precise  the manual is. Since IT IS BREAKING EXISTING CODE, for me, too. Before the change    if (is_a($date,"DateTime"))        return $date->format(...);    /// some code handling datetime strings worked just fine. Now it triggers __autoload and results in completely broken  page.  For sure, personally I can  change every piece of MY OWN code.  But consider users of tons of PHP libraries!

Little attention seems to be paid to how people may have been using the mechanism that has changed.  The whole thrust in this area was for is_a to test something that is supposed to be an instance.  Indeed, the at one time intended replacement for is_a is called "instanceof" and a string is not an instance of anything.  Changing an operation called "instanceof" to accept a class name ahead of the operator would seem perverse in the extreme.  Clearly the altered behavior of is_a may break any autoloader that assumes that it will only ever receive strings that can be assumed to be class names.  In particular, consider the common case where a set of class names can be mapped to a set of file names: in this situation, it is not unreasonable for the autoloader to terminate immediately if it receives a class name that contains ".." because this is very likely a hack attempt.  ``` **[2012-04-18 09:47 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` Automatic comment on behalf of stas Revision: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=10f20585fcbd524016e439c17bf01a0fd5191107> Log: fix [bug #55475](bug.php?id=55475) - implement is_a BC solution  ``` **[2012-07-02 10:30 UTC] rmc1134 at gmail dot com** ``` I don't get it: why should is_a() accept a string as its first argument?  This function is supposed to be a check on AN OBJECT and is_a('stdClass',  'stdClass') SHOULD NOT EVER RETURN any truthy value.  Calling __autoload() to check whether some string might be some object is  something a programmer should do, not the language.  ``` **[2012-07-24 23:39 UTC] [rasmus@php.net](//people.php.net/rasmus)** ``` Automatic comment on behalf of stas Revision: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=10f20585fcbd524016e439c17bf01a0fd5191107> Log: fix [bug #55475](bug.php?id=55475) - implement is_a BC solution  ``` **[2013-01-28 17:09 UTC] martijn dot niji at gmail dot com** ``` I must agree with the people who say that is_a('stdClass', 'stdClass') should not return true.  The is_a() function is intended as a function that checks a certain condition is true, that condition being that a certain variable/object is of a certain type/class.  Having is_a() try to automatically load a class by calling autoload is bad behaviour at best and a code breaking security flaw at worst.  ``` **[2013-11-17 09:35 UTC] [laruence@php.net](//people.php.net/laruence)** ``` Automatic comment on behalf of stas Revision: <http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=10f20585fcbd524016e439c17bf01a0fd5191107> Log: fix [bug #55475](bug.php?id=55475) - implement is_a BC solution  ``` |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

PHP 5.3.7 changed the behavior of the is\_a() function, used to check if an object is an instance of a class, to call the \_\_autoload() function. This causes a remote code execute problem when coupled with a standard library like PEAR that internally uses is\_a to check if a returned variable is an Error object or not.
An unprotected \_\_autoload() function that blindly includes based upon the variable it receives can be tricked into including a remote file by, for example, uploading a specially crafted file containing a link to a remote website.
Full explanation + code example has been posted on our website at http://www.byte.nl/blog/2011/09/23/security-bug-in-is\_a-function-in-php-
5-3-7-5-3-8/ and has been e-mailed to security (at) php (dot) net [email concealed]

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=741020#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-24 13:45:57 UTC  ``` It was reported [1],[2] that due to changes in the is_a() function [3],[4] PHP 5.3.7 and 5.3.8 became vulnerable to remote arbitrary code execution when is_a() is used in certain ways.  Due to the __autoload() implementation, if a user were able to upload a crafted file, it could be possible to pass the contents of the file as an argument to the __autoload() function which could in turn use that argument as a file to include().  If there was no adequate checking or enforcement of the file to load being, local, this could lead to including a remote script from a remote web site.  An example of a vulnerable __autoload() function could be:  function __autoload($class_name) {     include $class_name . '.php'; }  In the above example, were $class_name to include a remote URL, and if allow_url_fopen was enabled in php.ini, this could result in loading a remote PHP script on the server.  This flaw does not affect PHP versions prior to 5.3.7 were this change was introduced.  A fix is in PHP's subversion repository (r317183) [5].  [1] <http://www.byte.nl/blog/2011/09/23/security-bug-in-is_a-function-in-php-5-3-7-5-3-8/> [2] <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=55475> [3] <https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53727> [4] <http://svn.php.net/viewvc/?view=revision&amp;revision=312904> [5] <http://svn.php.net/viewvc/?view=revision&amp;revision=317183>   Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of php as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, or 6.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=741020#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-24 13:52:09 UTC  ``` Created php tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 741022](show_bug.cgi?id=741022 "CLOSED ERRATA - php: changes to is_a() in 5.3.7 may allow arbitrary code execution with certain code [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=741020#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-26 15:21:28 UTC  ``` A better (and less restrictive) work-around for this flaw is to disable allow_url_include rather than allow_url_fopen.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=741020#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-09-28 00:06:31 UTC  ``` This has been assigned the name [CVE-2011-3379](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3379)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=741020#c4)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-08 17:58:44 UTC  ``` php-5.3.8-3.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.
