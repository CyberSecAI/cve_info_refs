##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

===============
1) Introduction
===============
From vendor's website:
"ScadaPro is Real Time Data Acquisition software for Microsoft Windows.
Optimised to use the powerful real time, multi-tasking features of
Windows, ScadaPro provides integrated data acquisition, monitoring,
data logging, mimic development and report generation."
#######################################################################
=======
2) Bugs
=======
service.exe is a service listening on port 11234.
Initially I started to test this software as usual by checking all the
operations performed by the various opcodes which are divided in a
group identified by the second byte of the packet while the first one
is the opcode for the final operation.
The function that handles the various groups and opcodes is available
at offset 004061F0.
The problem is that there are so much security vulnerabilities and
design problems in this service that makes non convenient to continue
the tests so after the checking of the opcodes of the 'F' group and a
quick scan of the others I stopped any test to avoid to waste other
time.
It means that there are for sure other vulnerabilities but the most
importants (stack overflows, code execution and files access) have been
covered in the 'F' group and the main stack overflows of all the groups
can be catched with the simple scanner I linked in the next section.
In short there are stack overflow vulnerabilities in almost all the
supported commands and they are divided in sscanf and in-line strcpy
functions like the following taken from the "TF" command:
0040A0D9 . 8D5424 38 LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+38]
0040A0DD . 52 PUSH EDX
0040A0DE . 68 84D46700 PUSH service.0067D484 ; "%s"
0040A0E3 . 57 PUSH EDI
0040A0E4 . E8 12F20000 CALL service.004192FB ; sscanf
...
0040A114 > 8D5424 20 LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+20]
0040A118 . 8BC7 MOV EAX,EDI
0040A11A . 2BD7 SUB EDX,EDI
0040A11C . 8D6424 00 LEA ESP,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP]
0040A120 > 8A08 MOV CL,BYTE PTR DS:[EAX]
0040A122 . 880C02 MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EDX+EAX],CL
0040A125 . 83C0 01 ADD EAX,1
0040A128 . 84C9 TEST CL,CL
0040A12A .^75 F4 JNZ SHORT service.0040A120
Obviously there are many Denial of Service bugs too.
Then there is full control over the files to read and write and the
possibility to use directory traversal attacks like in the "RF" and
"wF" (the first char is lower because there is a check for avoiding its
usage), example of the tab-separeted arguments:
RF%
filename
ReadFile.nNumberOfBytesToRead
SetFilePointer.lDistanceToMove
SetFilePointer.dwMoveMethod
CreateFile.dwDesiredAccess
CreateFile.dwShareMode
???
CreateFile.dwCreationDisposition
CreateFile.dwFlagsAndAttributes
content if in write mode
It's also possible to delete files and whole folders (included their
files) via the "UF" and "NF" commands.
Then it's possible to pass custom arguments to the backup commands like
what happens with "BF", "OF" and "EF" while executing mszip because the
arguments are not sanitized versus the injection of the '"' char.
The program supports also other backup programs like tar and compress.
And finally, through the "XF" command it's possible to execute an
arbitrary function of a dll, for example the "system" one of msvcrt.dll
for executing any desired custom command.

No fix.
UPDATE 15 Sep 2011:
released version 4.0.1 that is no longer vulnerable.
this service was a legacy IPC component not really necessary for the
program so now it no longer accepts connections.

1) Introduction
===============
From vendor's website:
"ScadaPro is Real Time Data Acquisition software for Microsoft Windows.
Optimised to use the powerful real time, multi-tasking features of
Windows, ScadaPro provides integrated data acquisition, monitoring,
data logging, mimic development and report generation."

2) Bugs
=======
service.exe is a service listening on port 11234.
Initially I started to test this software as usual by checking all the
operations performed by the various opcodes which are divided in a
group identified by the second byte of the packet while the first one
is the opcode for the final operation.
The function that handles the various groups and opcodes is available
at offset 004061F0.
The problem is that there are so much security vulnerabilities and
design problems in this service that makes non convenient to continue
the tests so after the checking of the opcodes of the 'F' group and a
quick scan of the others I stopped any test to avoid to waste other
time.
It means that there are for sure other vulnerabilities but the most
importants (stack overflows, code execution and files access) have been
covered in the 'F' group and the main stack overflows of all the groups
can be catched with the simple scanner I linked in the next section.
UPDATE 15 Sep 2011:
the reason why this service had all these problems was simply because
it was a legacy experimental IPC feature that wasn't necessary and so
remained there for error.
In short there are stack overflow vulnerabilities in almost all the
supported commands and they are divided in sscanf and in-line strcpy
functions like the following taken from the "TF" command:
0040A0D9 . 8D5424 38 LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+38]
0040A0DD . 52 PUSH EDX
0040A0DE . 68 84D46700 PUSH service.0067D484 ; "%s"
0040A0E3 . 57 PUSH EDI
0040A0E4 . E8 12F20000 CALL service.004192FB ; sscanf
...
0040A114 > 8D5424 20 LEA EDX,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP+20]
0040A118 . 8BC7 MOV EAX,EDI
0040A11A . 2BD7 SUB EDX,EDI
0040A11C . 8D6424 00 LEA ESP,DWORD PTR SS:[ESP]
0040A120 > 8A08 MOV CL,BYTE PTR DS:[EAX]
0040A122 . 880C02 MOV BYTE PTR DS:[EDX+EAX],CL
0040A125 . 83C0 01 ADD EAX,1
0040A128 . 84C9 TEST CL,CL
0040A12A .^75 F4 JNZ SHORT service.0040A120
Obviously there are many Denial of Service bugs too.
Then there is full control over the files to read and write and the
possibility to use directory traversal attacks like in the "RF" and
"wF" (the first char is lower because there is a check for avoiding its
usage), example of the tab-separeted arguments:
RF%
filename
ReadFile.nNumberOfBytesToRead
SetFilePointer.lDistanceToMove
SetFilePointer.dwMoveMethod
CreateFile.dwDesiredAccess
CreateFile.dwShareMode
???
CreateFile.dwCreationDisposition
CreateFile.dwFlagsAndAttributes
content if in write mode
It's also possible to delete files and whole folders (included their
files) via the "UF" and "NF" commands.
Then it's possible to pass custom arguments to the backup commands like
what happens with "BF", "OF" and "EF" while executing mszip because the
arguments are not sanitized versus the injection of the '"' char.
The program supports also other backup programs like tar and compress.
And finally, through the "XF" command it's possible to execute an
arbitrary function of a dll, for example the "system" one of msvcrt.dll
for executing any desired custom command.
