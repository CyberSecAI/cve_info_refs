Subject: CVE-2011-3637 Linux kernel: proc: fix Oops on invalid /proc/<pid>/maps access

Hi,

I just analyzed this issue a little bit and thought I'd post a followup
to the thread on oss-security, but to my surprise I could not find the
issue mentioned in here, even though "nearby" ones (e.g. fixed in RHEL
at about the same time) were brought to this list.  I guess this has to
do with differences in CVE assignment - when an issue already has a CVE
ID, it is less likely to be brought up in here - which I find wrong.
This shouldn't be just a CVE ID assignment list, but a general Open
Source security list.  Anyway, to the specific issue:

<http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0007.html> says "A missing
validation flaw was found in the Linux kernel's m_stop() implementation.
A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to trigger a denial of
service. (CVE-2011-3637, Moderate)"  So I wanted to verify whether the
impact is in fact limited to a DoS.  More links:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=747848>

The fix, which I confirmed that it's included in at least OpenVZ's
linux-2.6.18-274.17.1.el5.028stab097.1, which is what I happen to care
about at this time:

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=76597cd31470fa130784c78fadb4dab2e624a723>

-	vma_stop(priv, vma);
+	if (!IS_ERR(vma))
+		vma_stop(priv, vma);

Linus' commit message:

"When m_start returns an error, the seq_file logic will still call m_stop
with that error entry, so we'd better make sure that we check it before
using it as a vma.

Introduced by commit ec6fd8a4355c ("report errors in /proc/*/*map*
sanely"), which replaced NULL with various ERR_PTR() cases.

(On ia64, you happen to get a unaligned fault instead of a page fault,
since the address used is generally some random error code like -EPERM)"

The commit referenced above as one that introduced the bug:

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=ec6fd8a4355c>

Thus, _assuming_ that the bug was in fact introduced by that commit
alone, it does appear to me that we have a mere DoS here - the pointer
being referenced has to be some -Exxx access code and nothing more
arbitrary.  Good.  (Additionally, the current fix only catches 4095
possible values, so if the problem were worse, it would be insufficient.)

Alexander

When m_start returns an error, the seq_file logic will still call m_stop
with that error entry, so we'd better make sure that we check it before
using it as a vma.

Introduced by commit [ec6fd8a](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/ec6fd8a4355cda81cd9f06bebc048e83eb514ac7) ("report errors in /proc/*/*map*
sanely"), which replaced NULL with various ERR_PTR() cases.

(On ia64, you happen to get a unaligned fault instead of a page fault,
since the address used is generally some random error code like -EPERM)
