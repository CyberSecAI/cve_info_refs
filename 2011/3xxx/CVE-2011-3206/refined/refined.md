**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were present in the JON (JBoss Operations Network) administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The JON administration interface did not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary web script execution: If an attacker could trick a logged-in JON administration interface user into visiting a specially crafted URL, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary web scripts within the context of the user's JON session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URLs: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that, when visited by a logged-in user, executes the injected script.
- Social Engineering:  The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious link, so social engineering is involved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to convince a logged-in user of the JON administration interface to visit the crafted URL.
- The attacker needs to be a remote attacker.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in JON 3.0 and JBoss Operations Network 2.4.2 (via RHSA-2012:0089).
