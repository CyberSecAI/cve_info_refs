Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an input validation flaw in Rekonq, a web browser, related to how it renders content within QLabels. The default rendering type for a QLabel is `QLabel::AutoText`, which uses heuristics to determine whether to render content as plain text or rich text. Rekonq does not properly force its QLabels to use `QLabel::PlainText` when displaying a certificate, which allows for the injection of rich text in certificate fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** Rekonq fails to sanitize or properly handle rich text input within certificate fields.
*   **Incorrect Rendering:** The use of `QLabel::AutoText` instead of `QLabel::PlainText` allows the rendering of rich text, leading to potential spoofing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Certificate Spoofing:** An attacker can craft a malicious certificate with embedded rich text, such as a table element within the common name (CN) field. When Rekonq displays this certificate, it will render the rich text, potentially tricking the user into believing the certificate is legitimate. This can lead to a user trusting a malicious site or connection.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Successful spoofing can enable further attacks like man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Certificate:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted certificate containing specially formatted rich text in its CN field.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker could potentially inject a malicious certificate during a connection attempt.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Generate/Modify Certificates:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify certificates.
*   **Network Position:** To perform a MitM attack, the attacker would need to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic, but exploitation is also possible if the user imports a malicious certificate.
*   **Targeted User Interaction:** The user has to interact with the malicious certificate in Rekonq, such as loading a website using the crafted certificate, or importing it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in KDE SC 4.6.0 up to and including KDE SC 4.7.1, and Rekonq versions up to at least 0.7.0. It's also noted that earlier versions of KDE SC may be affected.
*   Patches have been committed to the Rekonq Git repository with commit IDs: 85f454fa, 526ce56f, and d1711fff
*   The issue was addressed in rekonq version 0.9.2.
*   A similar vulnerability was found in KSSL (CVE-2011-3365) which is tracked in bug 743054.
*   Qt has also received a patch to warn users about sanitizing their QLabel input.
*   Red Hat issued RHSA-2011:1364 and RHSA-2011:1385 to address the vulnerability.
