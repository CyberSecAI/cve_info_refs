Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Improper Handling of Row Content:** When editing rows inline, phpMyAdmin did not properly sanitize or escape JavaScript code present within the row content. Upon saving, this unsanitized JavaScript was executed, leading to XSS.
*   **Lack of Sanitization:** phpMyAdmin failed to sanitize database, table, and column names before using them, which resulted in XSS vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Two distinct XSS vulnerabilities were identified:
    *   One arises from how phpMyAdmin handles inline editing of rows containing JavaScript.
    *   Another stems from a lack of sanitization when processing database, table, and column names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML/JavaScript Execution:** A remote attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript by tricking an authenticated user into visiting a crafted URL. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Defacement of the phpMyAdmin interface.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URL:** An attacker could craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript code within database, table, or column names.
*   **Inline Editing of Malicious Content:**  An attacker can insert JavaScript code into row content. After saving, this code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in phpMyAdmin user to visit a specially crafted URL for successful exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.4 are affected.
*   **Fix:** The issues were resolved by upgrading to phpMyAdmin 3.4.5 or applying the provided patches.
*   **CVE IDs:** The first issue is identified as CVE-2011-3591, and the second issue as CVE-2011-3592.
*   **Patches:** The patches address the issues by escaping HTML in the generated confirmation messages. This involves changes in `js/functions.js` and `js/tbl_structure.js` to use `escapeHtml()` function.
