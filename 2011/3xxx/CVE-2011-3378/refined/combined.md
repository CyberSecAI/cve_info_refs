Subject: rpm/librpm/rpm-python memory corruption pre-verification

Hey, after the scary flaws Georgi spotted in apt-get, I had a quick look at
rpm signature verification. Some trivial bitflipping found a few memory
corruption issues.

Originally I didn't think yum used rpm, but i was wrong, rpm-python is a
native module wrapper that exports librpm to python. I'll step through the
signature verification logic when I get a chance.

Obviously we need the sections of rpm code touched before signature
verification to be bulletproof, as most distributions rely on public mirror
services that may or may not be trusted. Any volunteers who know crypto
better than me appreciated, I'll be primarily looking for memory corruption.

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [rpm](/security/cves?package=rpm) - package manager for RPM

## Details

It was discovered that RPM incorrectly handled certain package headers. If

a user or automated system were tricked into installing a specially crafted

RPM package, an attacker could cause RPM to crash, resulting in a denial of

service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

# RPM 4.9.1.2 Release Notes

## Download information

* [rpm-4.9.1.2.tar.bz2](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/rpm/releases/historical/rpm-4.9.x/rpm-4.9.1.2.tar.bz2) source
* SHA1SUM: 5ec557424d90461f76d4ad30bfb6653b79920d58

## Summary of changes from RPM 4.9.1.1

This is a mainly a security update for CVE:2011-3378, with just one
additional fix for a severe signal handling regression in RPM 4.9.1
and 4.9.1.1.

### Security

* Do more thorough sanity checking on header (region) offsets when loading headers to avoid crashes
  (memory corruption, buffer overflows) on malformed packages (CVE:2011-3378, originally reported as [RhBug:741606](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=741606))

### General bugfixes and enhancements

* Fix a regression in RPM 4.9.1 and 4.9.1.1 rpmdb-related signal handling which can cause rpmdb not to be shut down
  cleanly on eg ctrl-c ([RhBug:739492](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=739492))

I could only easily test down to rpm-4.4.x (which is certainly affected too), but this is ancient code which hasn't seen much changes in a long long time.

I initially missed the regionSwab.rpm case which is different from the others in that no existing safeguard catches that, whereas the two others (dataStart.rpm and the copyTdEntry.rpm) are cleanly caught by the "normal" code paths taken by yum, and rpm in other than --checksig modes.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c8)  devzero2000    2011-09-28 10:59:59 UTC  ``` In reply at [comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c4)    rpm --checksig dataStart.rpm error: dataStart.rpm: Header: tag[0]: BAD, tag 63 type 7 offset 7540604 count 16 [andrew@andorra rpmb]# rpm --checksig regionSwab.rpm rpm: signature.c:749: verifyRSA: Assertion `rsactx != ((void *)0)' failed.

This is what I see with the second test case:  In headerLoad, rdl is read from the file.  The value is 0, hence both rdl and ril is 0.  Follows the first regionSwab call:  rdlen = regionSwab(entry+1, ril-1, 0, pe+1, dataStart, dataEnd, entry->info.offset);  as:  regionSwab (entry=0x669a60, il=-1, dl=0, pe=0x668758, dataStart=0x668aa8 "", dataEnd=0x669a34 "", regionid=0)  Negative il makes it exit immediately.  Follows another call to regionSwab:  /* Load dribble entries from region. */ rc = regionSwab(newEntry, ne, 0, pe+ril, dataStart, dataEnd, rid);  as:  regionSwab (entry=0x669a40, il=54, dl=0, pe=0x668748, dataStart=0x668aa8 "", dataEnd=0x669a34 "", regionid=1)  ie.info.offset and ie.info.count comes from file and is used to compute ie.data and ie.length.  The code does check that fits inside dataStart and dataEnd.  Test case does not seem to bypass those checks.  Then there is:  if (entry) {   ie.info.offset = regionid;   *entry = ie;        /* structure assignment */   entry++; }  which is what "damages" entry->data pointer.  Later on in headerFree, the check seems to distinguish cases where entry has own malloced data chunk, and data pointing to inside of some larger chunk using:  } else if (!ENTRY_IN_REGION(entry)) {   entry->data = _free(entry->data);  which translates to:  } else if (!(entry->info.offset < 0)) {  and hence code is confused to free something it should not.  It does not seem quite similar to the [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c0) case (i.e. not a memory corruption from buffer overflow due to missing end of buffer check, afaics), hence the question what I'm missing.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c14)  Mark J.

While we could make rpm -K use rpmReadHeader() which does far more thorough checking on the header sanity than headerRead() does, but that would still leave headerRead() and headerLoad() (both are public API functions) open to this vulnerability. headerRead() could be made to use rpmReadHeader() internally with some twisting and turning for newer versions, in old versions its not possible. And even then headerLoad() would be vulnerable. Rpm generally expects callers to have done maximum possible pre-validation before calling headerLoad(), but there's no way to enforce that. The whole headerLoad() interface is as unsafe as they come, and there will always be ways to make it crash as long as it's exported the way it is now. And we can't very well just remove it in stable releases either. Etc.  So the approach here is more of a minimal patch to plug these particular issues at the lowest level rather than attempt to cure the entire way headers get read and loaded.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2011-09-30 13:47:14 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #15](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c15)) > Assigning [CVE-2011-3378](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3378) for the issue described in [bug #741612](show_bug.cgi?id=741612 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - rpm: buffer overflow with malformed archive (copyTdEntry)") and [bug #741606](show_bug.cgi?id=741606 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3378 rpm: crashes and overflows on malformed header") > [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c2).

Please note this particular ([CVE-2011-3378](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3378)) Red Hat Bugzilla entry is dedicated to the [CVE-2011-3378](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3378) issue only. Any new issues (even related with original [CVE-2011-3378](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3378) patch) should be reported as new Red Hat Bugzilla entries.  We will investigate your report below and based on the results of the research, either dedicate a new Red Hat Bugzilla entry for that (if being a security flaw) or comment here to clarify, why Red Hat Security Response Team does not consider this issue to be a security flaw.  For future cases like this, please consult Red Hat Security Response Team: [1] <https://access.redhat.com/security/team/contact/>  first, to ensure your concerns to be promptly investigated and particular resolution provided.

Patches from that erratum try to ensure that rpm does not misbehave until the moment rpm signature is successfully verified.  After that point, rpm needs to be considered trusted as installation of rpm implies that, by definition, the rpm can execute arbitrary code even when it's perfectly well-formed.  > # rpm -ivh regionSwab.rpm > error: regionSwab.rpm: headerRead failed: Header sanity check: OK > Segmentation fault (core dumped)  rpm run this way does not abort if signature verification can not be done or if it fails.  If you want to install package that way, you should first check its signature (rpm -K) and proceed if it was signed by a trusted vendor.   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=741612#c0)  Tavis Ormandy    2011-09-27 12:38:43 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 525113](attachment.cgi?id=525113 "testcase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=525113&action=edit "testcase") testcase  if (ENTRY_IS_REGION(entry)) { 	    int32_t * ei = ((int32_t *)entry->data) - 2; 	    entryInfo pe = (entryInfo) (ei + 2); 	    unsigned char * dataStart = (unsigned char *) (pe + ntohl(ei[0])); 	    int32_t rdl = -entry->info.offset;	/* negative offset */ 	    int32_t ril = rdl/sizeof(*pe);  	    rdl = entry->rdlen; 	    count = 2 * sizeof(*ei) + (ril * sizeof(*pe)) + rdl; 	    if (entry->info.tag == HEADER_IMAGE) { 		ril -= 1; 		pe += 1; 	    } else { 		count += REGION_TAG_COUNT; 		rdl += REGION_TAG_COUNT; 	    }  	    td->data = xmalloc(count); 	    ei = (int32_t *) td->data; 	    ei[0] = htonl(ril); 	    ei[1] = htonl(rdl);  	    pe = (entryInfo) memcpy(ei + 2, pe, (ril * sizeof(*pe)));  Has this ever worked? I'm not sure how the rdl/ril calculation can work. With fuzzing I was able to cause a buffer overflow in the signature check.

Also sent a mail to secalert@.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=741612#c3)  Panu Matilainen    2011-09-28 06:59:23 UTC  ``` Just like [bug 741606](show_bug.cgi?id=741606 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3378 rpm: crashes and overflows on malformed header"), this probably affects pretty much every single rpm version ever released. I could only easily test down to rpm-4.4.x (which is certainly affected too), but this is ancient code which hasn't seen much changes in a long long time.  Also just like with the other bug, this also is detected by the query code path: [pmatilai@localhost ~]$ rpm -K ~/Downloads/copyTdEntry.rpm Segmentation fault (core dumped) [pmatilai@localhost ~]$ rpm -qp ~/Downloads/copyTdEntry.rpm error: /home/pmatilai/Downloads/copyTdEntry.rpm: headerRead failed: region trailer: BAD, tag 1768846712 type 761753205 offset 0 count 0 error: /home/pmatilai/Downloads/copyTdEntry.rpm: not an rpm package (or package manifest)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=741612#c4)  devzero2000    2011-09-28 11:05:30 UTC  ``` rpm --checksig copyTdEntry.rpm error: copyTdEntry.rpm: Header: region trailer: BAD, tag 1768846712 type 761753205 offset 0 count 0 [root@kiku rpmb]# rpm --version rpm (RPM) 5.3.9 [root@esil697 rpmb]# [root@kuku rpmb]# cat /etc/redhat-release Mandriva Linux release 2011.0 (Cooker) for x86_64 [root@kuku rpmb]#   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=741612#c6)  Mark J. Cox    2011-09-29 09:20:20 UTC  ``` I'm duping this bug with [bz#741606](show_bug.cgi?id=741606 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3378 rpm: crashes and overflows on malformed header") because this is the same problem as [bz#741606#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=741606#c2 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3378 rpm: crashes and overflows on malformed header"), where entry->info.offset is not being validated, it shares the same patch and CVE name as 741606[#c2](show_bug.cgi?id=741612#c2)  *** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of [bug 741606](show_bug.cgi?id=741606 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3378 rpm: crashes and overflows on malformed header") ***   ``` |  |
