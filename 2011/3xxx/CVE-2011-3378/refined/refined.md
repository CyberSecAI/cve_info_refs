  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of header offsets within RPM packages, leading to memory corruption issues.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Memory corruption",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A specially crafted RPM package could cause memory corruption, leading to crashes, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a malicious or malformed RPM package, particularly when verifying its signature or when loading its header data.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious RPM package to the system. This could be achieved by compromising package repositories or tricking a user or automated system into installing the malicious package."
