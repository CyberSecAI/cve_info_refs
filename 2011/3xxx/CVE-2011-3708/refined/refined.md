Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-3708 (This CVE is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, however, the discussion is related to path disclosure vulnerabilities, so this content is likely related to the CVE based on its proximity to the discussion around other similar vulnerabilities and the lack of specific CVE ID)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause is a path disclosure vulnerability present in multiple PHP CMS applications, specifically mentioned for Joomla! 1.6.1 and earlier versions of Joomla, where the application reveals the server's internal file paths in its responses or error messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability, specifically a path disclosure. The application is exposing sensitive information about the server's directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's file system structure, which can be used to facilitate further attacks.
- This information can reveal the location of sensitive files, which can then be targeted.
- It exposes internal paths which could reveal information about the underlying OS or software version.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the vulnerable application. By sending specific requests (not detailed, however) that trigger errors or unexpected responses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. No specific privileges or specific position is mentioned, suggesting that a remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content mentions that this type of vulnerability is common in PHP CMS applications, indicating a systemic issue and not isolated to only Joomla.
- It also mentions a reference to a list of paths vulnerabilities in many PHP applications.
- The discussion indicates that multiple such issues might be present and might not require a unique CVE for each of them
- The content implies that the vulnerability is exploitable in Joomla! 1.6.1 and earlier versions and that a fix was released in version 1.5.23 for one such issue.

The content primarily discusses Path Disclosure vulnerabilities in Joomla and other PHP CMS applications and provides context around the problem in general. It does not give specific technical details on how the vulnerability is exploited or the exact vulnerable code.
