Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper escaping of overlay file paths when used in the `chown(1)` command within the `kiwi` application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Shell Meta-Character Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a shell meta-character injection flaw.  Because the file paths aren't properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious shell meta-characters into the file path, leading to unintended command execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** By injecting shell meta-characters, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the user running the `kiwi` application. This could allow for system compromise, data modification, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Overlay Files:** An attacker would need to introduce malicious characters into the path of an overlay file that is then processed by the vulnerable `chown` command in kiwi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to influence overlay file paths:** An attacker needs to be able to control or influence the path of the overlay files used by the `kiwi` application. This could be achieved by creating a malicious appliance from an untrusted source or exploiting other vulnerabilities to alter the paths.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is specifically located in the `fixupOverlayFilesOwnership` subroutine of the `KIWIRoot.pm` module.
- The vulnerable code before the fix used double quotes `"$file"` which did not prevent shell meta character injection.
- The fix involves changing the double quotes to single quotes `'file'` to prevent the shell meta-character injection vulnerability.
- The vulnerable command is executed in a `chroot` environment.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content includes related commits that address the vulnerability, including code changes that show how the escaping was implemented.
- It appears that the issue was identified and patched relatively quickly
- This CVE is associated with other CVEs, such as CVE-2011-2225, CVE-2011-4195, CVE-2011-4193, CVE-2011-4192, suggesting a general issue with shell command injection in the `kiwi` application.
