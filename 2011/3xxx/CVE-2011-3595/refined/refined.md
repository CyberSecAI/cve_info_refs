Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of several parameters (searchword, extension, asset, author) within the Joomla! core components when submitted to the `/index.php` URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to the lack of input sanitization. Specifically:

*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerable parameters allow attackers to inject arbitrary script code into the page context, which will then be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities can lead to:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can compromise currently logged-in user or administrator sessions.
*   **Impersonation:** Attackers can impersonate arbitrary user actions, including administrative functions.
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Attackers can execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's browser, leading to potential data theft, phishing attacks, or further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters. The attacker can create a malicious link and trick a user to click it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be able to construct malicious URLs and trick a victim into visiting these URLs while logged in to the affected Joomla instance. For some of the XSS vectors, especially those affecting the administrator panel, the attacker needs a logged-in administrator to be a victim.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Joomla! version 1.7.0 and earlier.
*   Multiple components (com_search, com_categories, com_media) are affected.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Aung Khant from YGN Ethical Hacker Group.
*   The advisory mentions that a previously reported issue with the `searchword` parameter was not completely fixed, indicating an incomplete patch or regression.
*   The provided proof-of-concept URLs show how the attack can be performed with specific parameters of Joomla components.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.7.1-stable.
