| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:32:25 UTC  ``` Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way hardlink, the tool for consolidation of duplicate files via hardlinks, processed directory trees with deeply nested directories. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree, and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.  References: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/15/2> [2] <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=387269> [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=645516>  Proposed patch (applied by the Owl Linux distribution): [4] <http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/hardlink/hardlink.c.diff?r1=1.1;r2=1.2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:38:45 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the hardlink package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:41:35 UTC  ``` Created hardlink tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 746715](show_bug.cgi?id=746715 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3630 CVE-2011-3631 CVE-2011-3632 hardlink various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:53:29 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the hardlink package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-20 15:44:24 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-3630](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3630) has been assigned to these issues: [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/20/6>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-21 09:30:11 UTC  ``` This is really not a stack-based overflow, but an BSS-buffer overflow. It is caught by GCC "Object Size Checking Builtins", __builtin___strcat_chk in this particular case.  The overflow occurs at in hardlink.c at:  309     strcat (nambuf1, "/");  Since the allocated and the current size of the nambuf1 is already known, glibc can very easily determine if the current strcat() function would overflow the buffer and when it does it aborts the program and you can see the message  "*** buffer overflow detected ***: hardlink terminated"   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-28 05:06:58 UTC  ``` As mentioned in  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/22/3>  lstat() starts failing with ENAMETOOLONG shortly after the overflow occurs. This limits the size of the overflow, later hardlink crashes with "buffer overflow detectet" message.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-28 05:10:26 UTC  ``` In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, stack based buffer overflows are protected by FORTIFY_SOURCE. Though this is not stack-based buffer-overflow, FORTIFY_SOURCE along with the ability of the kernel to return an error when a exceedingly long path (because of buffer-overflow) is passed to lstat(), limits this vulnerability to just an application crash.  Statement:  This issue does not affect the version of hardlink, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c9)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-28 05:11:00 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect the version of hardlink as shipped with Fedora 14 and 15.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c10)  Fedora Update System    2011-11-23 23:27:41 UTC  ``` hardlink-1.0-12.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c11)  Fedora Update System    2011-12-11 21:49:56 UTC  ``` hardlink-1.0-12.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

# CVE-2011-3630

| **Name** | CVE-2011-3630 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | Hardlink before 0.1.2 suffer from multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws because of the way directory trees with deeply nested directories are processed. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree, and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the hardlink executable. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-3630) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2011-3630); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2011-3630), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2011-3630), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2011-3630), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2011-3630), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3630), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3630), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3630), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-3630)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3630/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2011-3630)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2011-3630%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2011-3630%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2011-3630%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:32:25 UTC  ``` Multiple stack-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way hardlink, the tool for consolidation of duplicate files via hardlinks, processed directory trees with deeply nested directories. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree, and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.  References: [1] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/15/2> [2] <https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=387269> [3] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=645516>  Proposed patch (applied by the Owl Linux distribution): [4] <http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/hardlink/hardlink.c.diff?r1=1.1;r2=1.2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:38:45 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the hardlink package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:41:35 UTC  ``` Created hardlink tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 746715](show_bug.cgi?id=746715 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-3630 CVE-2011-3631 CVE-2011-3632 hardlink various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:53:29 UTC  ``` These issues affect the versions of the hardlink package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-20 15:44:24 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-3630](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3630) has been assigned to these issues: [5] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/20/6>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-21 09:30:11 UTC  ``` This is really not a stack-based overflow, but an BSS-buffer overflow. It is caught by GCC "Object Size Checking Builtins", __builtin___strcat_chk in this particular case.  The overflow occurs at in hardlink.c at:  309     strcat (nambuf1, "/");  Since the allocated and the current size of the nambuf1 is already known, glibc can very easily determine if the current strcat() function would overflow the buffer and when it does it aborts the program and you can see the message  "*** buffer overflow detected ***: hardlink terminated"   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c7)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-28 05:06:58 UTC  ``` As mentioned in  <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/22/3>  lstat() starts failing with ENAMETOOLONG shortly after the overflow occurs. This limits the size of the overflow, later hardlink crashes with "buffer overflow detectet" message.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-28 05:10:26 UTC  ``` In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, stack based buffer overflows are protected by FORTIFY_SOURCE. Though this is not stack-based buffer-overflow, FORTIFY_SOURCE along with the ability of the kernel to return an error when a exceedingly long path (because of buffer-overflow) is passed to lstat(), limits this vulnerability to just an application crash.  Statement:  This issue does not affect the version of hardlink, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c9)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-10-28 05:11:00 UTC  ``` This issue does not affect the version of hardlink as shipped with Fedora 14 and 15.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c10)  Fedora Update System    2011-11-23 23:27:41 UTC  ``` hardlink-1.0-12.fc16 has been pushed to the Fedora 16 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=746709#c11)  Fedora Update System    2011-12-11 21:49:56 UTC  ``` hardlink-1.0-12.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

Hardlink before 0.1.2 suffer from multiple stack-based buffer overflow
flaws because of the way directory trees with deeply nested directories are
processed. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory
tree, and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink
executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.

| [Description](#c0)  Michael Harrison    2011-10-16 06:15:41 UTC  ``` The hardlink program is susceptible to buffer overflows of fixed-size nambuf1 and nambuf2 buffers when run on a tree with deeply nested directories and/or with long directory or file names. The problem can be reproduced by running the program on a directory containing 20 nested directories with 250-character names to get a segfault.  Another problem is that the program uses full pathnames.  It neither changes the current directory, nor uses openat(2).  Thus, if a pathname component is replaced with a symlink while the program is running, this may result in processing of directories/files outside of the intended directory tree.   ==Solution==  <http://cvsweb.openwall.com/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/Owl/packages/hardlink/>  For the unsafe handling of potentially changing directory trees, Solar Designer added a BUGS section to the man page:  BUGS        hardlink assumes that its target directory trees  do  not  change  from        under it.  If a directory tree does change, this may result in hardlink        accessing files and/or directories outside of  the  intended  directory        tree.   Thus,  you  must avoid running hardlink on potentially changing        directory trees, and especially on directory  trees  under  control  of        another user. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Tim Sammut (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2011-10-20 22:15:04 UTC  ``` CVE-2011-3630 hardlink buffer overflows <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=746709>  CVE-2011-3631 hardlink integer overflows <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=746710>  CVE-2011-3632 hardlink symlink attacks <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=746713> ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-05-19 10:29:08 UTC  ``` See hardlink.c here:  <http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=hardlink.git;a=tree>  Which is completely different program than hardlink from here:  <http://jak-linux.org/projects/hardlink/>  Plus the hardlink in openwall seems to be a third variant but also not same.  Anyway, the version 0.2.0 hardlink from jak-linux site is now in Portage as app-arch/hardlink and I doubt this security bug has *anything* to do with it at all  I suggest to close "INVALID".    Agreed? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-05-19 10:34:19 UTC  ``` The git for the app-arch/hardlink in tree seems to be here,  <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/jak/hardlink.git;a=summary>  This at least mentions closing of CVE-2011-3632  <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/jak/hardlink.git;a=commit;h=fc4da208525366aba289c7a150eb8a7d304d2238>  And after that a commit like, "Rewrite hardlink in C":  <http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/jak/hardlink.git;a=commit;h=bc0a8d544e3866a6ba62ea5f1bf7b8da6e616c11>  And a 0.2.0 release few commits after that...  Since this was never stable, I guess this could be closed as "FIXED" too ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Samuli Suominen (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2012-05-19 17:16:15 UTC  ``` Please, ignore my last comments entirely. I've done a bit more research and got it right now: ' The app-arch/hardlink-0.1.1 we had was Python, and the app-arch/hardlink-0.2.0 is C. Neither of these were the hardlink this bug was filed about. So this would make this bug INVALID.  But today, I've committed app-arch/hardlink-fedora to Portage which actually is the same hardlink we are talking about in this bug, so adjusting $summary now. And I've checked that the fixes for these security bugs, close(fd)'s, are included in the upstream app-arch/hardlink-fedora source already.  So we have no issues with any of the hardlink's in Portage currently. ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=746710#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-17 15:33:22 UTC  ``` Multiple integer overflows, leading to heap-based buffer overflows were found in the way hardlink, the tool for consolidation of duplicate files via hardlinks performed string lengths concatenation in the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted directory tree (with long directory and / or file names), and trick the local user into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash, or, potentially arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the hardlink executable.

Hi Julian,
   A security problem in hardlink had been reported:
<http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/15/2>

   The report refers to Fedora. Can you check if any Debian version is affected?

Thanks a lot!

It affects a version of hardlink written in C. Our version is
written in Python. Both have the same name, but are implemented
differently.

According to my knowledge the C version of hardlink(1) was not packaged
anywhere when I wrote the Python version (and just a .c file distributed
from people.redhat.com, and unmaintained).

Well, they are implemented differently but still both affected
by the attack stated in [CVE-2011-3632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3632). The following patch will
be included in the next release of hardlink.

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Document security issues (Closes: #[645516](bugreport.cgi?bug=645516), like
 [CVE-2011-3632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3632))

It seems that we are just as well affected by the same problem
as [CVE-2011-3632](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3632) in the original hardlink.c tool.

 takes one or more directories which will be searched for files to be linked.

+.SH BUGS
+.B hardlink
+assumes that the trees it operates on do not change during
+operation. If a tree does change, the result is undefined and potentially
+dangerous. For example, if a regular file is replaced by a device, hardlink
+may start reading from the device. If a component of a path is replaced by
+a symbolic link or file permissions change, security may be compromised. Do
+not run hardlink on a changing tree or on a tree controlled by another user.
