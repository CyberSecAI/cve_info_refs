- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow when allocating memory based on the `Content-Length` field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow leading to a zero-byte buffer allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Likely a denial-of-service due to the memory allocation failure.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a `Content-Length` of `-1` (or 4294967295) to the server on port 80.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the server on port 80.
