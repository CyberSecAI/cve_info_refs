Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-3153:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from Light Display Manager (LightDM) not dropping privileges when reading the `~/.dmrc` file. This file is used to store user-specific session settings, and it could be manipulated to point to arbitrary files, thereby allowing a user to bypass permission restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Handling:** LightDM reads the `~/.dmrc` file without dropping privileges, which allows it to access files that the user would not normally have access to.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** A local attacker can exploit the privilege issue to read arbitrary files by creating a symbolic or hard link from `~/.dmrc` to a target file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can read the content of configuration files or other files that they would normally not have permission to access. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information like passwords stored in configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create a symbolic or hard link to an arbitrary file and then rename/link that to `~/.dmrc`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a user account on the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to create files and symbolic/hard links within their own home directory.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The fix involves dropping privileges before accessing the `~/.dmrc` file and reclaiming privileges after.
*   The initial patch utilized the `O_NOFOLLOW` flag for the `open()` system call to prevent following symbolic links, but this was later replaced by removing the vulnerable code altogether.
*   The issue was addressed in LightDM version 1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1 for Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric) and 1.0.6-0ubuntu3 for Ubuntu Precise.
*   The `dmrc.c` file is the source of the vulnerability.
