# USN-1262-1: Light Display Manager vulnerabilities

15 November 2011

Several security issues were fixed in Light Display Manager.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)

## Packages

* [lightdm](/security/cves?package=lightdm) - Display Manager

## Details

It was discovered that Light Display Manager incorrectly handled privileges

when reading .dmrc files. A local attacker could exploit this issue to read

arbitrary configuration files, bypassing intended permissions.

([CVE-2011-3153](/security/CVE-2011-3153))

It was discovered that Light Display Manager incorrectly handled links when

adjusting permissions on .Xauthority files. A local attacker could exploit

this issue to access arbitrary files, and possibly obtain increased

privileges. In the default Ubuntu installation, this would be prevented

by the Yama link restrictions. ([CVE-2011-4105](/security/CVE-2011-4105))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 11.10

* [liblightdm-gobject-1-0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm)
  -
  [1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm/1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1)
* [liblightdm-qt-1-0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm)
  -
  [1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm/1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1)
* [lightdm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm)
  -
  [1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm/1.0.6-0ubuntu1.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

# lightdm doesn't drop privileges when reading ~/.dmrc

Bug #883865 reported by
[Marc Deslauriers](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)
on 2011-10-30

|  | [lightdm (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/lightdm "Latest release: 1.32.0-6ubuntu2, uploaded to universe on 2025-01-07 18:26:10.774357+00:00 by Simon Quigley (tsimonq2), maintained by Ubuntu Developers (ubuntu-devel-discuss-lists)") | Fix Released | Medium | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

LightDM doesn't drop privileges when reading the ~/.dmrc file. This allows a local user to read configuration files he would normally not have read permissions for, for example, mysql configuration files that contain passwords.

How to reproduce:

1- Create a /etc/app.conf file owned by root with 600 permissions, containing the following:

[App]

password=xyz

2- Log in as a regular user

3- rm ~/.dmrc

4- ln -s /etc/app.conf ~/.dmrc

5- Log out, log back in

6- look at ~/.dmrc

Note that it might be worth investigating for other issues like that. For the “write” vulnerability both .dmrc and .Xauthority were concerned, so .Xautority file reading might be a good idea to look at.

Yes, unfortunately the embargo is now broken since the commit is public.

@Robert: the file is most certainly read on Oneiric, I can reproduce the issue at will. Is something not working right with AccountsService?

News on what exactly? The code isn't in trunk anymore, and we've applied the patch to our releases.

If you're looking for a patch that doesn't use O\_NOFOLLOW, you might as well remove the offending code from lightdm altogether, that would be the best solution.
