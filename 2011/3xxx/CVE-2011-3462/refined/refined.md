- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Time Machine did not verify that the same device was being used for subsequent backup operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure verification of remote AFP volumes or Time Capsules used for Time Machine backups.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker could potentially access new backups created by the user's system by spoofing the remote backup volume.
- **Attack vectors**: Spoofing the remote volume.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to spoof the remote volume.
