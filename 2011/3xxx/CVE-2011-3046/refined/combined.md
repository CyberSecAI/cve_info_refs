How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[## Updates](/.)

This official feed from the Google Workspace team provides essential information about new features and improvements for Google Workspace customers.

## [New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/new-community-features-for-google-chat-and-an-update-currents%20.html "New community features for Google Chat and an update on Currents ")

Wednesday, April 12, 2023

**Note:**This blog post outlines upcoming changes to Google Currents for Workspace users. For information on the previous deprecation of Google+ for users with personal Google accounts, please [see this post](https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/expediting-changes-google-plus/).
### ---

### What's Changing

Last year, we **[announced plans to wind down Currents](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/currents-spaces-migration.html)**, to focus efforts on community experiences that are better integrated with the rest of Google Workspace. To help our customers manage this transition, we published [detailed guidance](https://support.google.com/a/answer/13137538) for Workspace administrators and enabled customers to opt-in for [automated migration of Currents data](https://support.google.com/a/answer/12129320?p=currentsfaq&visit_id=637801097348316846-2249159324&rd=2) to spaces in Google Chat.

We are nearing the end of this transition. Beginning July 5, 2023, Currents will no longer be available. Workspace administrators can [export Currents data using Takeout](https://support.google.com/a/answer/100458) before August 8, 2023. Beginning August 8th, Currents data will no longer be available for download.

Although we are saying goodbye to Currents, we continue to invest in new features for [Google Chat](https://chat.google.com/), so teams can connect and collaborate with a shared sense of belonging. Over the last year, we've delivered features designed to support community engagement at scale, and will continue to deliver more. Here is a summary of the features with additional details below: [![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s16000/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20(2).png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEil-tQSvWkISdvbujn818sEroZRYYKpRGceE-TwpWRdVewQPlU0imIwcmg0yno39j1pZ-zoJgqmivcU0Sip6hAyaceJ4f488VTs_9tsqXZC15AlQZOxx4QPIGkS0HxkcOGSkG3BSGLRzdoXKHq9mmvfwaF5t011Gi_VPQ7DxrtpCgu7M5sODOd-XciE/s2074/GWS_Timeline_Chrono_LINKS%20%282%29.png)
This month, we’re enabling **new ways for organizations to share information** across the enterprise with [announcements in Google Chat](http://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/04/announcements-in-google-chat.html). This gives admin controls to limit permissions for posting in a space, while enabling all members to read and react, helping ensure that important updates stay visible and relevant. Later this year, we plan to simplify membership management by integrating Google Groups with spaces in Chat, enable post-level metrics for announcements, and provide tools for Workspace administrators to manage spaces across their domain.

We’ve already rolled out **new ways to make conversations more expressive and engaging** such as [in-line threading](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/in-line-threading-in-Chat-spaces.html) to enable rich exploration of a specific topic without overtaking the main conversation and [custom emojis](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/custom-emojis-google-chat.html) to enable fun, personal expression.

We’ve also made it easier for individuals to **discover and join communities of shared interest**. By [searching in Gmail](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/08/chat-spaces-search-in-gmail.html), users can explore a directory of available spaces covering topics of personal or professional interest such as gardening, pets, career development, fitness, cultural identity, and more, with the ability to [invite others to join](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/03/share-spaces-in-google-chat.html) via link. Last year, we increased [the size of communities supported by spaces in Chat to 8,000 members](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/07/building-larger-spaces-in-google-chat%20.html), and we are working to scale this in a meaningful way later this year.

As communities grow, it’s essential to provide **tools for content moderation and data management**. Last year, we introduced [space managers](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/02/define-and-manage-chat-spaces-space.html), a community lead with [abilities](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) to [moderate conversation](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/03/new-space-manager-capabilities-google-chat.html) and [manage membership](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/01/improved-membership-management-google-chat-spaces.html), and last year at NEXT, we rolled out [data loss prevention](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2022/10/data-loss-prevention-google-chat-generally-available.html) (DLP) for Chat. We will continue to enhance community health and data security for Google Chat.

Our partner community is extending the power of Chat through **integrations with essential third-party apps** such as [Jira, GitHub, Asana, PagerDuty](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/how-to-be-more-productive-as-developer-5-app-integrations-for-google-chat-that-can-help.html), [Zendesk and Salesforce](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/release-notes-02-24-2023.html). Many organizations have **built custom workflow apps using low-code and no-code tools**, and we anticipate that this number will continue to grow with the GA releases of the Chat API and AppSheet’s Chat app building capabilities later this year.

For teams to thrive in this rapidly changing era of hybrid work, it’s essential to build authentic personal connections and a strong sense of belonging, no matter when or where individuals work. We will continue to make Google Chat the best option for Workspace customers seeking to build a community and culture for hybrid teams, with much more to come later this year.

# Chromium: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium, some of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **17.0.963.83** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **17.0.963.83** |

### Background

Chromium is an open source web browser project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium. Please review
the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted web
site using Chromium, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition,
Universal Cross-Site Scripting, or installation of an extension without
user interaction.

A remote attacker could also entice a user to install a specially
crafted extension that would interfere with browser-issued web requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/chromium-17.0.963.83"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
