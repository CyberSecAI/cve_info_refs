How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Debian Bug     :

Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities have been discovered in the xen
hypervisor. One of the issue (CVE-2012-5513) could even lead to privilege
escalation from guest to host.

Some of the recently published Xen Security Advisories (XSA 25 and 28) are not
fixed by this update and should be fixed in a future release.

CVE-2011-3131 (XSA 5): DoS using I/OMMU faults from PCI-passthrough guest

	A VM that controls a PCI[E] device directly can cause it to issue DMA
	requests to invalid addresses. Although these requests are denied by the
	I/OMMU, the hypervisor needs to handle the interrupt and clear the error from
	the I/OMMU, and this can be used to live-lock a CPU and potentially hang the
	host.

CVE-2012-4535 (XSA 20): Timer overflow DoS vulnerability

	A guest which sets a VCPU with an inappropriate deadline can cause an
	infinite loop in Xen, blocking the affected physical CPU indefinitely.

CVE-2012-4537 (XSA 22): Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability

	When set_p2m_entry fails, Xen's internal data structures (the p2m and m2p
	tables) can get out of sync. This failure can be triggered by unusual guest
	behaviour exhausting the memory reserved for the p2m table. If it happens,
	subsequent guest-invoked memory operations can cause Xen to fail an assertion
	and crash.

CVE-2012-4538 (XSA 23): Unhooking empty PAE entries DoS vulnerability

	The HVMOP_pagetable_dying hypercall does not correctly check the
	caller's pagetable state, leading to a hypervisor crash.

CVE-2012-4539 (XSA 24): Grant table hypercall infinite loop DoS vulnerability

	Due to inappropriate duplicate use of the same loop control variable,
	passing bad arguments to GNTTABOP_get_status_frames can cause an
	infinite loop in the compat hypercall handler.

CVE-2012-5510 (XSA 26): Grant table version switch list corruption vulnerability

	Downgrading the grant table version of a guest involves freeing its status
	pages. This freeing was incomplete - the page(s) are freed back to the
	allocator, but not removed from the domain's tracking list. This would cause
	list corruption, eventually leading to a hypervisor crash.

CVE-2012-5513 (XSA 29): XENMEM_exchange may overwrite hypervisor memory

	The handler for XENMEM_exchange accesses guest memory without range checking
	the guest provided addresses, thus allowing these accesses to include the
	hypervisor reserved range.
	.
	A malicious guest administrator can cause Xen to crash. If the out of address
	space bounds access does not lead to a crash, a carefully crafted privilege
	escalation cannot be excluded, even though the guest doesn't itself control
	the values written.

CVE-2012-5514 (XSA 30): Broken error handling in guest_physmap_mark_populate_on_demand()

	guest_physmap_mark_populate_on_demand(), before carrying out its actual
	operation, checks that the subject GFNs are not in use. If that check fails,
	the code prints a message and bypasses the gfn_unlock() matching the
	gfn_lock() carried out before entering the loop.
	.
	A malicious guest administrator can then use it to cause Xen to hang.

CVE-2012-5515 (XSA 31): Several memory hypercall operations allow invalid extent order values

	Allowing arbitrary extent_order input values for XENMEM_decrease_reservation,
	XENMEM_populate_physmap, and XENMEM_exchange can cause arbitrarily long time
	being spent in loops without allowing vital other code to get a chance to
	execute. This may also cause inconsistent state resulting at the completion
	of these hypercalls.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.5.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

As far as I can see both the AMD and Intel code clears the error in the IOMMU and carries on, but I suspect some more vigorous action is appropriate. I've seen traces from an Intel machine that seemed to be livelocked on IOMMU faults from a passed-through VGA card, until it was killed by the watchdog.  I think I can see two things that contribute to that:   - The Intel IOMMU fault handler prints quite a lot of info in interrupt    context, making it easier to livelock.  Still I think the general    problem applies on AMD too.  - Domain destruction re-assigns passed though cards to dom0, but the    cards don't seem to get reset.  So there's nothing to stop a card    battering away at DMA in the meantime.  That seems like a problem    independent of livelock, actually.  In any case, it seems like it would be a good idea to stop a broken/malicious/deassigned card from flooding Xen with IOMMU faults.  I was considering just writing 0 to the faulting card's PCI command register, but I'm told that's not always enough to properly deactivate a card, and it might be a little over-zealous to do it on the first offence.

Although these requests are denied by the IOMMU, the hypervisor needs to handle the interrupt and clear the error from the IOMMU, and this can be used to live-lock a CPU and potentially hang the host.  Because this issue has already been discussed on public mailing lists, there is no embargo on this advisory or the patches.  VULNERABLE SYSTEMS ==================  Any system where an untrusted VM is given direct control of a PCI[E]  device is vulnerable.   IMPACT ======  A malicious guest administrator of a VM that has direct control of a PCI[E] device can cause a performance degradation, and possibly hang the host.  RESOLUTION ==========  This issue is resolved in changeset 23762:537ed3b74b3f of xen-unstable.hg, and 23112:84e3706df07a of xen-4.1-testing.hg. -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE----- Version: GnuPG v1.4.9 (GNU/Linux)  iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJORSmkAAoJEIP+FMlX6CvZYDcIAKsgu6vDOG5Lz8/DLl48N/zg KqPzbhW1XMm1b67un5r/bsWnuS9/z/jD8PEzybqLbS8RHwKE9XoXrJqx0Xz/Z+32 oJslxQjIzESlCf20QoNlOuPp6WgbsWGWKac+UO2r2CVtyx38L9P13OyRgzRzcoOn eFAGB0iccr0gtWXsP2eK9MHhkGNk0yS1qJoI1XPp6DefREypUTDZOVzmgOOUuR+N 1OOUsGhdNt5mKjD/9hP7qDt6gs7EbvRrD8AHI72x4Sv9toy3i8qPO7o2PJH+X9r6 KObhbxkqgSwRaLjM+CIzFlmXXwD9GHSnzPWUO6LqAQPO6QdkUCpFSXwFRdy1H/0= =qeJB -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----  _______________________________________________ Xen-devel mailing list Xen-devel@xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <http://lists.xensource.com/xen-devel>   ``` | | --- |   | [[More with this subject...](/archives/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi?query=%2Bsubject:%2F%5E%28%3F:%5E%5Cs%2A%28re%7Csv%7Cfwd%7Cfw%29%5B%5C%5B%5C%5D%5Cd%5D%2A%5B:%3E-%5D%2B%5Cs%2A%29%2A%5C%5BXen%5C-devel%5C%5D%5Cs%2BXen%5Cs%2BAdvisory%5Cs%2B5%5Cs%2B%5C%28CVE%5C-2011%5C-3131%5C%29%5Cs%2BIOMMU%5Cs%2Bfault%5Cs%2Blivelock%5Cs%2A%24%2F&idxname=xen-devel&sort=date%3Alate)] | | --- |   | **<Prev in Thread**] | **Current Thread** | [[**Next in Thread>**](msg00452.html) | | --- | --- | --- | | * **[Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock**,   *Xen . org security team* <=   + **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00452.html)**, *Jan Beulich*     - **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00454.html)**, *Tim Deegan*       * **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00457.html)**, *Jan Beulich** **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00534.html)**, *Tim Deegan** **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00539.html)**, *Jan Beulich*           * **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00581.html)**, *Jan Beulich** **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00638.html)**, *Tim Deegan** **[Re: [Xen-devel] Xen Advisory 5 (CVE-2011-3131) IOMMU fault livelock](msg00643.html)**, *Jan Beulich* | | | |
