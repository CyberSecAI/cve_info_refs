Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3195:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `shared/inc/sql/lists.php` file of the dtc (Domain Technologie Control) web control panel.
- The code constructs a shell command using user-provided input from the `$_REQUEST` array without proper sanitization. Specifically, it uses `echo $_REQUEST[$tunable_name] > $option_file` within an `exec()` call, which is vulnerable to shell injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Shell Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through the `$_REQUEST[$tunable_name]` parameter. By crafting a malicious input string, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the dtc application.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code fails to validate or sanitize the user-provided input before using it in a shell command. This lack of input checking is the direct cause of the shell injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server with the privileges of the web server user. This can lead to a wide range of malicious activities, including:
    - System compromise
    - Data breaches
    - Denial of service
    - Installation of malware
    - Manipulation of server configuration.

**Attack vectors:**

- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `$_REQUEST[$tunable_name]` parameter within an HTTP request sent to the vulnerable script. This means the attacker can inject shell commands by crafting a specific HTTP request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the dtc application in order to send malicious HTTP requests.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** The attacker needs basic understanding of HTTP request parameters and the structure of web requests to craft the malicious input.
- **No prior authentication:** The vulnerability exists in code that is accessible without any specific authentication.
