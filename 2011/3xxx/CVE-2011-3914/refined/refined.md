```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Out-of-bounds write in v8 i18n (internationalization) handling.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which can lead to memory corruption.
- Impact of exploitation: Exploitation could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior due to memory corruption.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is triggered during the handling of i18n functionality within the v8 Javascript engine.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to craft malicious input that triggers the vulnerable code path within the v8 i18n handling.
