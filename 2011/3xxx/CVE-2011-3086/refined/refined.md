- Unexpected application termination: The memory corruption could also lead to the application crashing or terminating unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted website: An attacker could embed malicious code within a website, which, when visited by a vulnerable browser, would trigger the use-after-free vulnerability.
- Malicious HTML content: The vulnerability can be triggered by rendering malicious HTML content through applications like iTunes and Safari.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to host or deliver malicious HTML/web content: The attacker needs to be able to host or otherwise deliver the malicious content to the victim. This could be through a compromised website, a phishing email with a malicious link, or other means of delivering HTML/web content.
