## Safari 6.0

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0678 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may cause files from the user's system to be sent to a remote server

  Description: An access control issue existed in the handling of feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0679 : Aaron Sigel of vtty.com

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Passwords may autocomplete even when the site specifies that autocomplete should be disabled

  Description: Password input elements with the autocomplete attribute set to "off" were being autocompleted. This update addresses the issue by improved handling of the autocomplete attribute.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0680 : Dan Poltawski of Moodle

* **Safari Downloads**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: An issue existed in Safari's support for the 'attachment' value for the HTTP Content-Disposition header. This header is used by many websites to serve files that were uploaded to the site by a third-party, such as attachments in web-based e-mail applications. Any script in files served with this header value would run as if the file had been served inline, with full access to other resources on the origin server. This issue is addressed by downloading resources served with this header, rather than displaying them inline.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3426 : Mickey Shkatov of laplinker.com, Kyle Osborn, Hidetake Jo at Microsoft and Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR)

* **WebKit**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

# Chromium, V8: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201205-03**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium and V8,
some of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **19.0.1084.46** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **19.0.1084.46** |

| Package | **dev-lang/v8** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.9.24.21** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.9.24.21** |

### Background

Chromium is an open source web browser project. V8 is Google’s open
source JavaScript engine.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium and V8. Please
review the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A context-dependent attacker could entice a user to open a specially
crafted web site or JavaScript program using Chromium or V8, possibly
resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
process, or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=www-client/chromium-19.0.1084.46"

```

All V8 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/v8-3.9.24.21"
