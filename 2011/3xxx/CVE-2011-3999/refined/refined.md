Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3999:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper processing of HTML page output within the RSS/Atom feed reader function of the Iwate Portal Bar add-on for Internet Explorer. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or properly encode feed information before rendering it as HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a classic XSS issue (CWE-79). The lack of proper handling of feed data allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within the HTML output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's Internet Explorer browser. This can have various impacts, such as:
    *   Session hijacking: Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting to malicious websites
    *   Information theft: Accessing sensitive data on the page.
    *   Defacement: Altering the visual content of the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious RSS/Atom Feeds:** An attacker can craft a malicious RSS or Atom feed containing embedded JavaScript.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to load the malicious feed using the vulnerable Iwate Portal Bar's feed reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker can deliver the malicious feed over the network, meaning they don't need direct access to the user's machine.
*   **No Authentication:** The attack does not require any form of authentication (anonymous access).
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be convinced to load or view the malicious feed, a standard action that may not raise immediate suspicion.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vendor has stopped distributing the vulnerable product, and users are advised to discontinue use of Iwate Portal Bar.
*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity (CVSS v2 base score 4.3).
*   The exploit complexity is rated as high, meaning that the user needs to be convinced to perform some action that they may find suspicious.
