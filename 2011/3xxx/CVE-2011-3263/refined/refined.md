The provided content describes a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the Zabbix agent related to the `vfs.file.cksum` item.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises when the `vfs.file.cksum` item is used to calculate the checksum of a special device like `/dev/urandom`. This causes the checksum generator to process an infinite stream of data, leading to excessive CPU usage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of special devices by the `vfs.file.cksum` item.
- Lack of input validation or resource limits for checksum calculations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service of the Zabbix agent due to 100% CPU utilization.
- The affected Zabbix agent becomes unresponsive and unable to perform monitoring tasks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a request to the Zabbix agent to calculate the checksum of a special device via the `vfs.file.cksum` item.
- This can be achieved using tools like `netcat` (nc).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the Zabbix agent on the network (e.g., via port 10050).
- No authentication or special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
