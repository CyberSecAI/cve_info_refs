Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-3599:

**Root Cause:**
- The `Crypt::DSA` Perl module used a cryptographically insecure method for generating random numbers when the `/dev/random` file was not available on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Random Number Generation:** The fallback mechanism for random number generation was weak and predictable, making the generated DSA keys vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially discover portions or the entirety of the secret DSA key generated by the vulnerable code. This would allow the attacker to impersonate the victim or decrypt data protected by the compromised key.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Systems where the `/dev/random` device is not accessible. This could include systems with:
    - Non-standard configurations
    - Limited environments (e.g., embedded systems)
    - Systems where SELinux policies restrict access to `/dev/random`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to target a system where `Crypt::DSA` is used and the system does not have a proper `/dev/random` device or where access to this device is restricted by some policies.
- The attacker would also likely need to be able to generate or observe DSA key generation on the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was present in the perl-Crypt-DSA package as shipped with Fedora 14 and 15, as well as within the EPEL-4, EPEL-5, and EPEL-6 repositories.
- Although most Fedora/EPEL systems would use the `/dev/random` code path, the vulnerability was still present in the code and was considered a security risk in cases where `/dev/random` access was unavailable or restricted.
- The fix involves removing the vulnerable fallback code for random number generation.
