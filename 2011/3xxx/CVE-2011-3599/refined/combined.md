Under 'affects' I mean that the relevant code part / fallback is present in the code.   Though obviously on Fedora and EPEL systems, the safer /dev/random code branch would be used for DSA key generation. Thus this deficiency would not show and I will leave the decision to the perl-Crypt-DSA module developers, if it's worthy to schedule new Fedora / EPEL updates or not.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=743567#c3)  Paul Howarth    2011-10-05 13:58:36 UTC  ``` Given that no Fedora/EPEL system is actually going to be impacted by this, I'm inclined to wait until there's a new upstream release before "fixing" it.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=743567#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-06 08:52:51 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-3599](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-3599) has been assigned to this issue: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/10/05/9>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=743567#c6)  Petr Pisar    2013-09-03 09:03:03 UTC  ``` Does SELinux policy deny access to /dev/random in some cases? If yes, then such process would be affected.  I can imagine an administrator will confine a third-party application by assigning a dedicated label to increase security. Because default policy is to deny, the DSA generation will get doomed.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=743567#c7)  Paul Howarth    2013-09-03 09:32:24 UTC  ``` You're right.

Subject: CVE Request -- perl-Crypt-DSA -- Cryptographically insecure method
 used for random numbers generation on systems without /dev/random

Hello Josh, Steve, vendors,

   it has been reported that Crypt::DSA, a Perl module for DSA
signatures and key generation, used cryptographically weak / insecure
method for random numbers generation on systems, where /dev/random file
was not present. Due this flaw an attacker could be able to discover
some portions of / whole secret DSA key, which has been created on such
system.

[3] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=743567>

Proposed upstream patch is to remove the affected fallback code part:
[4] <https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=71421#txn-984052>
     (though not approved yet)

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you && Regards, Jan.
