- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The custom web server used by Cogent DataHub improperly handles specific characters (+, %20, %2e) appended to URLs, leading to source code disclosure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Source code disclosure vulnerability. The web server doesn't properly process URL encoded characters, exposing server-side scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can view the content of server-side scripts (ASP files), potentially exposing sensitive information like database credentials, logic, and other valuable information used by the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending HTTP requests to the affected server with a URL containing a "+", "%20", or "%2e" character at the end of the ASP file URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server, meaning they must have network access to the DataHub server.
