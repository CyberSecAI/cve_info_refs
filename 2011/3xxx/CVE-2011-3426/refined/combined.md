## Safari 6.0

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A cross-site scripting issue existed in the handling of feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0678 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may cause files from the user's system to be sent to a remote server

  Description: An access control issue existed in the handling of feed:// URLs. This update removes handling of feed:// URLs.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0679 : Aaron Sigel of vtty.com

* **Safari**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Passwords may autocomplete even when the site specifies that autocomplete should be disabled

  Description: Password input elements with the autocomplete attribute set to "off" were being autocompleted. This update addresses the issue by improved handling of the autocomplete attribute.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2012-0680 : Dan Poltawski of Moodle

* **Safari Downloads**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: An issue existed in Safari's support for the 'attachment' value for the HTTP Content-Disposition header. This header is used by many websites to serve files that were uploaded to the site by a third-party, such as attachments in web-based e-mail applications. Any script in files served with this header value would run as if the file had been served inline, with full access to other resources on the origin server. This issue is addressed by downloading resources served with this header, rather than displaying them inline.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3426 : Mickey Shkatov of laplinker.com, Kyle Osborn, Hidetake Jo at Microsoft and Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR)

* **WebKit**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7.4, OS X Lion Server v10.7.4

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit. These issues are addressed through improved memory handling.

This issue was originally reported as CVE-2011-3426. We can confirm that
Mobile Safari on iOS 7.1.2 is still affected. We've reported this to
Apple on February 25, 2014. You can test is yourself at:
```

<http://www.securify.nl/cve-2011-3426.html>

This test page sets the following HTTP headers:

Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=cve-2011-3426.html
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

With kind regards,

Yorick

  Description: An issue existed in CFNetwork's handling of HTTP cookies. When accessing a maliciously crafted HTTP or HTTPS URL, CFNetwork could incorrectly send the cookies for a domain to a server outside that domain.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3246 : Erling Ellingsen of Facebook

* **CoreFoundation**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

* **Data Access**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: An exchange mail cookie management issue could incorrectly cause data synchronization across different accounts

  Description: When multiple mail exchange accounts are configured which connect to the same server, a session could potentially receive a valid cookie corresponding to a different account. This issue is addressed by ensuring that cookies are separated across different accounts.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3257 : Bob Sielken of IBM

* **Data Security**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other authorities, are not trusted.

* **Data Security**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve

  Description: Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses. Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509 certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root certificate.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3427

* **Data Security**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection

  Description: Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some information about the previous data. If the same connection was attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3389

* **Home screen**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: Switching between applications may lead to the disclosure of sensitive application information

  Description: When switching between applications with the four-finger app switching gesture, the display could have revealed the previous application state. This issue is addressed by ensuring that the system properly calls the applicationWillResignActive: method when transitioning between applications.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3431 : Abe White of Hedonic Software Inc.

* **Safari**

  Available for: iOS 3.0 through 4.3.5 for iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, iOS 3.1 through 4.3.5 for iPod touch (3rd generation) and later, iOS 3.2 through 4.3.5 for iPad

  Impact: Opening maliciously crafted files on certain websites may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: iOS did not support the 'attachment' value for the HTTP Content-Disposition header. This header is used by many websites to serve files that were uploaded to the site by a third-party, such as attachments in web-based e-mail applications. Any script in files served with this header value would run as if the file had been served inline, with full access to other resources on the origin server. This issue is addressed by loading attachments in an isolated security origin with no access to resources on other sites.
