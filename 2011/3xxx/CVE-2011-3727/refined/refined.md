Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3727:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2011-3727 relates to a path disclosure vulnerability. This type of vulnerability generally stems from a web application revealing the server's internal directory structure or file paths within error messages or other responses.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is the exposure of potentially sensitive information through path disclosure. This occurs when the application displays the absolute path of files or directories on the server, for example in error messages or through file upload/download responses.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information disclosure:** Attackers can gain knowledge of the application's internal structure, file system paths, and potentially other server-specific details, which could be used to further exploit the system.
- **Potential further exploits:**  Knowledge of file paths might enable an attacker to target specific files, discover configuration files or other sensitive data, or even perform local file inclusion attacks in some cases.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is primarily through HTTP requests to the web application.
- The attacker needs to trigger the conditions under which the application reveals file paths. This can be done through malformed input, attempts to access non-existent resources, or exploiting other vulnerabilities which might lead to error conditions that reveal file paths.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not need any specific privilege or prior knowledge beyond the application's address.

**Additional Notes:**
- One email mentions that "Path Disclosure should better be regarded as more closely related to server-side issue." This highlights the nature of the vulnerability. It's not necessarily a specific flaw in the application code but more of a consequence of how errors or file handling is done.
- The links provided in the email also point to potential path disclosure vulnerabilities in other PHP based CMS applications, suggesting a common pattern of the issue.
- The Gentoo security advisory also lists CVE-2011-3727 as one of the vulnerabilities present in DokuWiki which could lead to disclosure of local files.

In summary, CVE-2011-3727 is a path disclosure vulnerability that allows attackers to uncover sensitive information about the server's file structure, which may lead to further attacks.
