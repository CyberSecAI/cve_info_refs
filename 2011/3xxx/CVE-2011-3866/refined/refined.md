Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3866:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the ability of web pages to access device motion data on mobile devices. Researchers demonstrated that this motion data could be used to infer keystrokes on touch screen devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted Access to Motion Data:** Web pages, including those running in background tabs, could access device motion data without proper restrictions.
*   **Potential for Keystroke Inference:** The motion data was detailed enough that it could be analyzed to determine the keys being pressed on a touch screen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Keystroke Logging:** Malicious web pages could potentially log the keystrokes of users, including sensitive information like passwords and personal data, by analyzing motion data generated while typing on their mobile devices.
*   **Privacy Violation:** This vulnerability enabled a privacy breach by allowing websites to potentially track user input without the user's knowledge or consent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Pages:** An attacker could create a malicious web page designed to collect motion data and attempt to infer the user's keystrokes.
*   **Background Tabs:** The attack could even occur when the malicious page was running in a background tab, potentially intercepting user input in the foreground.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Serve Web Content:** The attacker would need to be able to host or inject a malicious web page into the user's browser.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to have the attacker's web page open in their browser, although it could be in a background tab.
*   **Mobile Device with Motion Sensors:** The victim would need to be using a mobile device equipped with motion sensors.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes a link to the research paper, "TouchLogger: Inferring Keystrokes on Touch Screen from Smartphone Motion," which details the research that discovered this vulnerability.
*   The fix implemented by Mozilla restricts access to device motion data to the currently active tab, mitigating the risk of background tabs inferring keystrokes from the foreground tab.
*   The fix was implemented in Firefox 7 and SeaMonkey 2.4.
