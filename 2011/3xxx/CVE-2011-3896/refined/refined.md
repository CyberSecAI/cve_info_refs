Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Buffer overflow in shader variable mapping

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the shader variable mapping functionality of the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity, implying it could lead to significant impact.
*   A successful exploit could potentially cause memory corruption which may lead to arbitrary code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The specific attack vector is not detailed beyond "shader variable mapping", which suggests an issue related to how the software handles and maps shader variables.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The specific capabilities are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that an attacker would need to be able to provide specially crafted shader variables that could trigger the buffer overflow during the mapping process.
*   This typically requires the attacker to be able to influence the data being processed by the affected shader functionality which in turn would require the user to load a malicious page or asset that uses that shader.
*  The attacker would need knowledge of the specific requirements of the shader variable mapping functionality to craft a malicious input that can trigger the overflow.

**Additional Notes**
* The vulnerability was credited to Ken “strcpy” Russell of the Chromium development community.
* The provided content indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in a stable channel update to version 15.0.874.120.
