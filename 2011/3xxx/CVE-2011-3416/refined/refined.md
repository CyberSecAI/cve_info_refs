{
  "CVE-2011-3416": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to the ASP.NET Framework incorrectly authenticating specially crafted usernames during forms authentication.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Authentication"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can bypass authentication and gain access to another user's account, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary commands on the site with the targeted user's privileges.",
     "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker needs to register an account on the ASP.NET application, and must know an existing account name for a targeted user. The attacker then crafts a special web request using the previously registered account name.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to register an account on the ASP.NET site and have knowledge of an existing user name to impersonate."
