Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3413:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. Specifically, it occurs when PowerPoint reads an invalid record within these files. This leads to an error that can corrupt memory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  The core weakness is the ability to corrupt memory due to improper handling of malformed OfficeArt records within PowerPoint files.
- **Improper Input Validation:** PowerPoint fails to properly validate the structure and content of the OfficeArt records when opening PowerPoint files, leading to the memory corruption issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:**  A successful exploit can enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system.
- **Full System Control:** An attacker gaining code execution can achieve complete control over the affected system.
- **Malicious Activities:** This control allows the attacker to:
    - Install malicious programs.
    - View, change, or delete data.
    - Create new accounts with full user rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email Attachments:** Attackers can embed the malicious PowerPoint file as an attachment in an email. If a user opens the file, the vulnerability can be triggered.
- **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host the malicious file on a compromised website or a site they control. They would then need to convince users to visit the site and open the malicious PowerPoint file, often via a link in an email or instant message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious PowerPoint Files:** The attacker must be able to create a PowerPoint file that contains malformed OfficeArt records, designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the victim to open the malicious PowerPoint file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft PowerPoint. This can occur when a user opens an attachment received in email, or opens the file through a web browser.
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a normal user. However, an attacker gains the same privileges as the current user.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft, and there is no indication that it had been publicly disclosed or exploited before the release of the security update.
- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2011-3396, though both are addressed in the same security bulletin (MS11-094).
