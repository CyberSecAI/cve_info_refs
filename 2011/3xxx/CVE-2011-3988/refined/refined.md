Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-3988:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries within the `SC_Query.php` file of EC-CUBE. Specifically, certain code sections were not sanitizing input leading to SQL injection when specific conditions are met, this was due to the presence of code that prepended or replaced characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **SQL Injection:** The core vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. By manipulating input, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the queries executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** A remote attacker can potentially view sensitive data stored within the EC-CUBE database.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the internet.
-   **Malicious Input:** The attacker injects SQL code through user-supplied parameters

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have valid user credentials or login to exploit this.
-   **Network Access:** Attackers require network access to the vulnerable EC-CUBE instance.
-   **Understanding of the Application's SQL Generation:** Attackers need some understanding of the application's SQL statement construction.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `data/class/SC_Query.php`.
- The fix involves removing specific code blocks that handle the `~` character, which allowed for direct injection into SQL queries.
- Specifically, the following lines were removed/changed:
    -   Around line 462:
        ```
        } else if(strpos($val, '~') === 0) {
           $strval .= preg_replace("/^~/", "", $val);
        }
        ```
    -   Around line 502:
       ```
       } else if(strpos('~', $val) === 0) {
           $arrCol[] = $key . '= ' . $val;
       }
       ```

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as occurring under "special conditions," implying it might not be readily apparent in all uses of the software.
- The vulnerability is distinct from other EC-CUBE SQL injection vulnerabilities (JVN#81111541 and JVN#19072922).
- The fix involves removing specific code segments rather than replacing them.
- The vulnerability was reported by Tsukada Nobuhisa of Seasoft to IPA.
