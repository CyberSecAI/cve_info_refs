# Chromium: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201203-19**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in Chromium, some of
which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/chromium** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **17.0.963.83** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **17.0.963.83** |

### Background

Chromium is an open source web browser project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Chromium. Please review
the CVE identifiers and release notes referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted web
site using Chromium, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition,
Universal Cross-Site Scripting, or installation of an extension without
user interaction.

A remote attacker could also entice a user to install a specially
crafted extension that would interfere with browser-issued web requests.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Chromium users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/chromium-17.0.963.83"

```
