    "Description": "An integer overflow, leading to heap-based buffer overflow, was found in the Java2D code use for performing transformations of graphical shapes and images.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in Java2D TransformHelper.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Application crash or lead to code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Untrusted Java application or applet",
      "Specially crafted input for trusted Java application"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to execute or provide input to a Java application"
  },
  "CVE-2011-3552": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that the number of UDP sockets an application running with SecurityManager restrictions can use by default was set too high. If multiple instances of a malicious applications were started at the same time, it can result in exhaustion of all available UDP sockets, possibly blocking other applications on the system from being able to do UDP network communication.",
    "Root cause": "Excessive default UDP socket limit under SecurityManager.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service by exhaustion of UDP sockets, potentially blocking other applications from UDP network communication.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious Java application or applet."
    ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to execute multiple instances of the malicious application."
