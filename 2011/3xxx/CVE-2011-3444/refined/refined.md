- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Address Book's support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for accessing CardDAV had a downgrade issue, where it would attempt an unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection failed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application was downgrading to an unencrypted connection without user approval, leading to a lack of transport layer encryption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in a privileged network position could intercept CardDAV data due to the fallback to unencrypted communication.
- **Attack vectors:** A man-in-the-middle attack in a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, capable of intercepting and manipulating network traffic. They do not need a specific system account.
