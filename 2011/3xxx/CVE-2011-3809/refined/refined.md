The provided content discusses a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! 1.6.1 and prior versions, but this is not related to CVE-2011-3809. The email thread mentions assigning CVE-2011-2488 to a different Joomla vulnerability.

Specifically, the email discusses:

*   **Vulnerability:** Path disclosure in Joomla! 1.6.1 and lower.
*   **Root cause:**  The email mentions a path disclosure vulnerability in Joomla! 1.6.1 but doesn't provide technical details. It references a blog post ([http://bl0g.yehg.net/2011/04/joomla-161-and-lower-information.html](http://bl0g.yehg.net/2011/04/joomla-161-and-lower-information.html)) which would contain more details, but the provided content does not include the details.
*   **Weakness:** Path disclosure, where the server reveals the full path of files or directories.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure. An attacker can gain knowledge of the server's filesystem structure.
*  **Attack vector**: The content mentions the issue exists in many PHP CMS applications, suggesting the vulnerability is likely triggered through HTTP requests. The specific method is not described in detail within the text.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would likely need to make a request to the vulnerable web application (Joomla).

This vulnerability is not CVE-2011-3809, as the CVE was assigned to a different issue.
