Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-3190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP) connector in Apache Tomcat handles incoming requests. Specifically, it involves a flaw in how AJP requests are processed, allowing for request spoofing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **AJP Request Spoofing:** The core weakness is the ability to forge or spoof AJP requests. This is due to a lack of proper validation or sanitization of AJP data, specifically the AJP "Data" packet.  Tomcat uses lazy-reading strategy for reading AJP "Data" packet. It doesn't read the post request "Data" packet until it's requested. The connection is keep-alive, and the next packet might be a "Data" packet. If the first byte of the "Data" packet's length field is 0x02(Forward Request Packet) or 0x0A(CPing Packet), then tomcat will be in trouble because it will be treated as either forward request or CPing, even though it's not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access/Actions:** By successfully spoofing AJP requests, an attacker could potentially perform actions they wouldn't normally have authorization for. The attacker can control parameters in the request, and make the web server do things it is not supposed to do.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The ability to forge requests could lead to the modification of data within the application.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As mentioned in some of the provided documents, this can be a denial of service as a side effect.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker would exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network connection.
*   **AJP Connector:** The vulnerability resides within the AJP connector, making it the specific entry point for attacks.
*   **Crafted Packets:** The attacker would need to craft malicious AJP packets to exploit the weakness.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server, specifically the AJP port.
*   **Knowledge of AJP Protocol:** Understanding of the AJP protocol is necessary to craft valid, but malicious, packets.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (Potentially):** While not explicitly stated in all sources, in some cases, an attacker might need to be in a position to intercept and modify or send forged AJP requests (man-in-the-middle).

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is related to the lazy-reading strategy of AJP Data packet by the tomcat server.
*   The fix involves correctly processing AJP packets to prevent spoofing of requests.
*   This vulnerability is present in HP-UX Apache Running Tomcat Servlet Engine, and Tomcat 5.5.x, 6.0.x, and 7.0.x.
*   The vulnerability is related to CVE-2011-1184, CVE-2011-2204, CVE-2011-2526, CVE-2011-3375, CVE-2011-4858, CVE-2011-5062, CVE-2011-5063, CVE-2011-5064, and CVE-2012-0022 as well.
