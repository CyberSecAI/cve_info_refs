- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "g" parameter in the `/index.php` is not properly sanitized before being used in the HTML output. Specifically, it's directly embedded in the value attribute of a hidden input field within the signup form.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary script code that will be executed within the victim's browser when they visit a specially crafted URL. This could lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, data theft, and defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted by crafting a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload in the "g" parameter. When a victim visits the URL, the unsanitized input will be rendered in the HTML and the malicious script will execute within their browser session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a crafted URL to the victim. The victim needs to visit the malicious URL in their browser while logged into the vulnerable application for full exploitation.
