Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Stable Channel Release and Beta Channel Update](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2012/03/stable-channel-release-and-beta-channel.html "Stable Channel Release and Beta Channel Update")

Wednesday, March 28, 2012

**The Chrome team is excited to announce the release of Chrome 18 to the Stable Channel for Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome Frame. 18.0.1025.142 contains a number of new features including faster and fancier graphics.** **More detailed updates are available on the [Chrome Blog](http://chrome.blogspot.com/) **and the [Chromium Blog](http://blog.chromium.org/)**.**

**Security fixes and rewards:
Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

Some of the items listed below represent the start of hardening measures based on study of the exploits submitted to the Pwnium competition.**

We’d also like to thank miaubiz, Chamal de Silva, Atte Kettunen of OUSPG, Aki Helin of OUSPG and Arthur Gerkis for working with us during the development cycle and preventing security regressions from ever reaching the stable channel. $8000 of additional rewards were issued for this awesomeness.

Full details about what changes are in this release are available in the [SVN revision log](http://build.chromium.org/f/chromium/perf/dashboard/ui/changelog.html?url=/trunk/src&range=113143:119867&mode=html).  Interested in hopping on the stable channel?  [Find out how](http://dev.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel).  If you find a new issue, please let us know by [filing a bug](http://new.crbug.com/).**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## iOS 6.1

* **Identity Services**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Authentication relying on certificate-based Apple ID authentication may be bypassed

  Description: An error handling issue existed in Identity Services. If the user's AppleID certificate failed to validate, the user's AppleID was assumed to be the empty string. If multiple systems belonging to different users enter this state, applications relying on this identity determination may erroneously extend trust. This issue was addressed by ensuring that NULL is returned instead of an empty string.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0963

* **International Components for Unicode**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: A canonicalization issue existed in the handling of the EUC-JP encoding, which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack on EUC-JP encoded websites. This issue was addressed by updating the EUC-JP mapping table.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3058 : Masato Kinugawa

* **Kernel**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: A user-mode process may be able to access the first page of kernel memory

  Description: The iOS kernel has checks to validate that the user-mode pointer and length passed to the copyin and copyout functions would not result in a user-mode process being able to directly access kernel memory. The checks were not being used if the length was smaller than one page. This issue was addressed through additional validation of the arguments to copyin and copyout.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0964 : Mark Dowd of Azimuth Security

* **Security**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Several intermediate CA certificates were mistakenly issued by TURKTRUST. This may allow a man-in-the-middle attacker to redirect connections and intercept user credentials or other sensitive information. This issue was addressed by not allowing the incorrect SSL certificates.

* **StoreKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: JavaScript may be enabled in Mobile Safari without user interaction

  Description: If a user disabled JavaScript in Safari Preferences, visiting a site which displayed a Smart App Banner would re-enable JavaScript without warning the user. This issue was addressed by not enabling JavaScript when visiting a site with a Smart App Banner.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2013-0974 : Andrew Plotkin of Zarfhome Software Consulting, Ben Madison of BitCloud, Marek Durcek

* **WebKit**

  Available for: iPhone 3GS and later, iPod touch (4th generation) and later, iPad 2 and later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to an unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution

  Description: Multiple memory corruption issues existed in WebKit. These issues were addressed through improved memory handling.
