Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-3439:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the FreeType library, specifically in its processing of fonts. Multiple memory corruption issues were present.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption issues, likely related to how FreeType parses and handles font data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could potentially execute malicious code on the victim's system by exploiting this flaw.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Viewing a document containing a maliciously crafted font. This could include documents opened by applications using the FreeType library to render fonts.
- The vulnerability is triggered when FreeType processes a crafted font, suggesting font files as the attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to craft a malicious font file.
- The attacker needs to find a way to have the crafted font processed by a system using the vulnerable FreeType library. This could involve tricking the user into opening a document containing the font or visiting a website that uses the crafted font.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content from Apple confirms the vulnerability is in FreeType.
- The Apple document states: “Multiple memory corruption issues existed in FreeType, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary code execution when processing a maliciously crafted font”. This confirms the impact as described above.
- This vulnerability is not specific to Apple products but affects all systems that use the vulnerable FreeType library. The SUSE security update also addresses this vulnerability.
- The Secunia content gives a high-level overview of their research team, but does not offer additional information on this specific CVE.
