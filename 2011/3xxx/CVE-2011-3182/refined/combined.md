Date:
- - Dis.: 20.07.2011

Affected Software (verified):
PHP 5.3.6 and prior

Fixed:
PHP 5.3.7

- --- 0.Description ---
PHP is a general-purpose scripting language originally designed for web
development to produce dynamic web pages. For this purpose, PHP code is
embedded into the HTML source document and interpreted by a web server
with a PHP processor module, which generates the web page document. It
also has evolved to include a command-line interface capability and can
be used in standalone graphical applications.

- --- 1. PHP 5.3.6 multiple null pointer dereference ---
Some time ago we have reported list with possible NULL pointer
dereferences in php 5.3.6. If user may change size of malloc, it's
possible to get NULL pointer dereferences. I haven't enought time to
check security impacts for all these bugs.

To demonstrate these flaws, we may use default memory limit in OpenBSD
[512MB]. We should allocate a lot of memory like 510MB (still 2MB free).
If some string is longer than 2MB (example 4MB), and php try copy this
string using malloc/strlen etc then malloc return NULL. Then program is
counting with possible NULL pointer dereference or buffer overflow
sympthons.

Example:
<http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/690.html>

where CWE-690 give CWE-476 NULL pointer dereference

good example for CWE-690 is

 	tz->location.comments = malloc(comments_len + 1);
 	memcpy(tz->location.comments, *tzf, comments_len);

This code may provide to null pointer dereference or simple crash with
nulling memory with memset()

	in.str = malloc((e - s) + YYMAXFILL);
	memset(in.str, 0, (e - s) + YYMAXFILL);
	memcpy(in.str, s, (e - s));

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0xbba7581c in memset () from /usr/lib/libc.so.12
(gdb) x/i $eip
0xbba7581c <memset+44>: rep stos %eax,%es:(%edi)
(gdb) x/x $eax
0x0:    Cannot access memory at address 0x0
(gdb) x/x $edi
0x0:    Cannot access memory at address 0x0

In this case, memset() overwrite the memory with 0x0 char. If attacker
can put something else that 0x0, it would have security impact.

There are more interesting places, where user may try change size of
malloc. See bellow

Subject: CVE assignment php NULL pointer dereference - CVE-2011-3182

This message was sent to the full-disclosure mailing list:
<http://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&m=131373057621672&w=2>

>From what I can tell, this is a plausible problem. The advisory doesn't
show any specific places where this could be exploited, but there are quite
a few unchecked calls to malloc(). Rather than go through them all, I'm
assigning the ID CVE-2011-3182 to be safe.

Thanks.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our

## OS X Lion v10.7.3 and Security Update 2012-001

* **Address Book**

  Available for: OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.2, OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.2

  Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position may intercept CardDAV data

  Description: Address Book supports Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for accessing CardDAV. A downgrade issue caused Address Book to attempt an unencrypted connection if an encrypted connection failed. An attacker in a privileged network position could abuse this behavior to intercept CardDAV data. This issue is addressed by not downgrading to an unencrypted connection without user approval.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3444 : Bernard Desruisseaux of Oracle Corporation

* **Apache**

  Available for: Mac OS X v10.6.8, Mac OS X Server v10.6.8, OS X Lion v10.7 to v10.7.2, OS X Lion Server v10.7 to v10.7.2

  Description: There are known attacks on the confidentiality of SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0 when a cipher suite uses a block cipher in CBC mode. Apache disabled the 'empty fragment' countermeasure which prevented these attacks. This issue is addressed by providing a configuration parameter to control the countermeasure and enabling it by default.

  CVE-ID

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Two certificate authorities in the list of trusted root certificates have independently issued intermediate certificates to DigiCert Malaysia. DigiCert Malaysia has issued certificates with weak keys that it is unable to revoke. An attacker with a privileged network position could intercept user credentials or other sensitive information intended for a site with a certificate issued by DigiCert Malaysia. This issue is addressed by configuring default system trust settings so that DigiCert Malaysia's certificates are not trusted. We would like to acknowledge Bruce Morton of Entrust, Inc. for reporting this issue.
