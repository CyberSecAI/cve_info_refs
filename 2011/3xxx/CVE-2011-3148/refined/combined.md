# Linux-PAM: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-31**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Linux-PAM, allowing
local attackers to possibly gain escalated privileges, cause a Denial of
Service, corrupt data, or obtain sensitive information.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/pam** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.5** |

### Background

Linux-PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) is an architecture allowing
the separation of the development of privilege granting software from the
development of secure and appropriate authentication schemes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Linux-PAM. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A local attacker could use specially crafted files to cause a buffer
overflow, possibly resulting in privilege escalation or Denial of
Service. Furthermore, a local attacker could execute specially crafted
programs or symlink attacks, possibly resulting in data loss or
disclosure of sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Linux-PAM users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/pam-1.1.5"

```

NOTE: This is a legacy GLSA. Updates for all affected architectures are
available since November 25, 2011. It is likely that your system is
already no longer affected by this issue.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# fedorahosted.org retirement

## Summary

fedorahosted.org was retired on March 1st, 2017. If you are viewing this page, odds are it's after that date and you have been redirected here by attempting to go to some project on fedorahosted.org. If you are a user of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org, please search for the new home the project you are interested in likely has. If you are a maintainer of a project formerly hosted at fedorahosted.org and need your data to migrate, see below.

## Background

fedorahosted.org was set up in late 2007 as a location to host svn, git, hg, and bzr projects. The trac wiki and issue tracker was used for issues and project planning. Groups for each project were managed in the Fedora Account System, and via a wrapper, scp/sftp uploads of releases was supported. Many of the projects there were closely related to Fedora, but not all of them. For many years fedorahosted thrived.

With the rise of GitHub and the pull request (PR) workflow most new projects moved to other locations. In early 2015, pagure.io came into being. It was a from the ground up implementation of the new git/PR workflow and also hosted by and maintained by Fedora Infrastructure. In early 2016 it became clear that Fedora Infrastructure didn't have resources to keep maintaining both fedorahosted.org and pagure.io and so the announcement was made to retire fedorahosted. Maintainers have had over the last year to migrate their projects to pagure.io or whatever other place they wish.

## Reasons for retirement

* Over the last few years there have been almost 0 new projects added to fedorahosted.org. This shows not much interest by the developer community.
* fedorahosted.org uses trac 0.12 (a Long term release), but upstream is very behind on newer releases. (The next 0.12 bugfix is 18 months behind schedule and the next 1.0 stable is 4 months late as of this writing). Newer trac and all its plugins would need to be packaged for a new release.
* A fair bit of technical debt has piled up over the years:
  + fedorahosted.org is running RHEL6
  + is not in Ansible (our configuration management (CM))
  + isn't distributed in any way
* The 'fedorahosted.org' domain and using fas groups to manage committers has tied fedorahosted.org to Fedora, causing some projects issues.

## General answers

* If you are a maintainer who needs data off the old fedorahosted.org instance, please file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure/> with your request. Please be clear what data you want (trac db, git repo, other) and how you want us to get the data to you.
* We are also happy to setup redirects for your project to a new location. Just file an issue in <https://pagure.io/fedora-infrastructure> and we will try and help you out.
* If you are a user of a project formerly at fedorahosted.org, please check <https://pagure.io/> for the project, it may have moved there.
* lists.fedorahosted.org will continue to work and exist for the future.

# USN-1237-1: PAM vulnerabilities

24 October 2011

PAM could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 11.10](/security/notices?release=oneiric)
* [Ubuntu 11.04](/security/notices?release=natty)
* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [pam](/security/cves?package=pam) - Pluggable Authentication Modules

## Details

Kees Cook discovered that the PAM pam\_env module incorrectly handled

certain malformed environment files. A local attacker could use this flaw

to cause a denial of service, or possibly gain privileges. The default

compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a

denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3148](/security/CVE-2011-3148))

Kees Cook discovered that the PAM pam\_env module incorrectly handled

variable expansion. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial

of service. ([CVE-2011-3149](/security/CVE-2011-3149))

Stephane Chazelas discovered that the PAM pam\_motd module incorrectly

cleaned the environment during execution of the motd scripts. In certain

environments, a local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code

as root, and gain privileges.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# stack buffer overflow in pam\_env

Bug #874469 reported by
[Kees Cook](https://launchpad.net/~kees)
on 2011-10-14

|  | [pam (Ubuntu)](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/pam "Latest release: 1.4.0-11ubuntu2.5, uploaded to main on 2024-11-20 15:30:11.995553+00:00 by Ponnuvel Palaniyappan (pponnuvel), maintained by Ubuntu Developers (ubuntu-devel-discuss-lists)") | Fix Released | Undecided | Unassigned |  |

### Bug Description

pam\_env reads ~/.pam\_environment by default. The routine that parses this file does not correctly validate the size of leading whitespace, and can overflow a character array on the stack. This is currently caught by the stack protections on Ubuntu, but looks to be a more serious problem on Debian which, prior to current unstable, doesn't have pam built with stack protection.

Since this is a bug in a shared library, this will crash whatever is running the code. Most pam-using applications use a separate process for these calls, so the effects should be minimal on Ubuntu, but there could be applications that don't deal well with the pam libraries suddenly exploding.

To reproduce:

perl -e 'print " " x 256, "\\";' >> ~/.pam\_environment

perl -e 'print " " x 256, "\\";' >> ~/.pam\_environment

perl -e 'print " " x 256, "\\";' >> ~/.pam\_environment

perl -e 'print " " x 256, "\\";' >> ~/.pam\_environment

perl -e 'print "A" x 256;' >> ~/.pam\_environment
