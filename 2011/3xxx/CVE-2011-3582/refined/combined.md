> (CSRF) Vulnerability
>
>
>
> 1. OVERVIEW
>
> The Advanced Electron Forums (AEF)  1.0.9 <= versions are vulnerable
> to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
>
>
> 2. BACKGROUND
>
> AEF has a very simple and easy to use Administration Panel and
> installing this software is a piece of cake! You can install new
> themes, customize themes the way you want. The User Control Panel has
> a simple yet beautiful interface where users can set their
> preferences
> for the board.
>
>
> 3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION
>
> Advanced Electron Forums (AEF) 1.0.9 <=  versions contain a flaw that
> allows a remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The
> flaw exists because the application does not require multiple steps
> or
> explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of
> administrator functions such as adding new user, assigning user to
> administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may
> trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of
> the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the
> application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing
> arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the
> application, without further prompting or verification.
>
>
> 4. VERSIONS AFFECTED
