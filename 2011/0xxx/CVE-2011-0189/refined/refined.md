- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the Terminal application defaulting to SSH version 1 when using the "New Remote Connection" dialog, which is less secure than version 2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of an insecure default protocol (SSHv1) in a user interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  When users connect to remote servers using the "New Remote Connection" dialog, they are using an insecure protocol, which could expose them to security vulnerabilities associated with SSHv1.
- **Attack vectors**:  Man-in-the-middle attacks targeting SSHv1 connections.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker positioned to intercept the initial handshake of the SSH connection. The attacker must be on the network path between the client and server.
