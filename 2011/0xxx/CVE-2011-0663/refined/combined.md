# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-031 - Critical

## Vulnerability in JScript and VBScript Scripting Engines Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2514666)

Published: April 12, 2011 | Updated: April 20, 2011

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a privately reported vulnerability in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visited a specially crafted Web site. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.

This security update is rated Critical for all supported editions of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the JScript and VBScript scripting engines process scripts in Web pages. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Internet Explorer 9 is installed on my system. Do I need to install this update?**

No. If Internet Explorer 9 is installed on your system, your versions of the JScript 5.8 and VBScript 5.8 scripting engines are already up-to-date and do not require this update. However, if Internet Explorer 9 is not installed on your system, you need to install the correct update for the versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines installed on your system. See the FAQ below for instructions on determining which versions are installed on your system.

**How do I determine which versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on my system?**

The versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engine installed on a system are dependent on the version of Internet Explorer that is installed on the system, and will change if a newer version of Internet Explorer is installed. Internet Explorer 6 includes the JScript 5.6 and VBScript 5.6 scripting engines; Internet Explorer 7 includes the JScript 5.7 and VBScript 5.7 scripting engines; and Internet Explorer 8 includes the JScript 5.8 and VBScript 5.8 scripting engines. Internet Explorer 9 also includes the JScript 5.8 and VBScript 5.8 scripting engines, but the specific versions installed with Internet Explorer 9 are already up-to-date and do not require this update.

To determine which versions of the JScript and VBScript scripting engines are installed on your system, perform the following steps:

1. Open Windows Explorer.
2. Navigate to the **%systemroot%\system32** directory.
3. Right-click **jscript.dll**, select **Properties**, and then click the **Details** tab (repeat this step for **vbscript.dll**, which is located in the same directory).

The version number is listed in the **File Version** field. If your file version starts with 5.8, for example 5.8.7600.16385, then JScript 5.8 is installed on your system.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0663](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0663).

#### Mitigating Factors for Scripting Memory Reallocation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0663

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, removing the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for Scripting Memory Reallocation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0663

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click **Prompt** or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Scripting Memory Reallocation Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0663

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that the JScript and VBScript scripting engines process scripts in Web pages. When the scripting engines attempt to reallocate memory while decoding a script in order to run it, an integer overflow can occur.

**What is JScript?**

JScript is an interpreted, object-based scripting language that is often used to make Web sites more flexible or interactive. JScript scripts can run only in the presence of an interpreter or host, such as Active Server Pages (ASP), Internet Explorer, or Windows Script Host. More specifically, JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the ECMA 262 language specification (ECMAScript Edition 3). For more information, see the MSDN Article, [JScript Fundamentals](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/6974wx4d%28vs.85%29.aspx), or visit the Web site, [ECMA International](https://www.ecma-international.org/).

**What is VBScript?**

VBScript (Visual Basic Script) is an interpreted, object-based scripting language that is often used to make Web sites more flexible or interactive. VBScript scripts can run only in the presence of an interpreter or host, such as Active Server Pages (ASP), Internet Explorer, or Windows Script Host. For more information, see the MSDN article, [VBScript Fundamentals](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0ad0dkea%28vs.85%29.aspx).

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to visit the Web site. This could also include compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit these vulnerabilities. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client, workstation, or terminal server systems where Internet Explorer is used to browse Web pages are primarily at risk.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx) is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

This security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which the JScript and VBScript scripting engines process scripts in Web pages.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

## [Releasing jsfunfuzz and DOMFuzz](https://www.squarefree.com/2015/07/28/releasing-jsfunfuzz-and-domfuzz/ "Permanent Link to Releasing jsfunfuzz and DOMFuzz")

July 28th, 2015

Today I'm releasing two fuzzers: [jsfunfuzz](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/blob/master/js/jsfunfuzz/README.md), which tests JavaScript engines, and [DOMFuzz](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/blob/master/dom/README.md), which tests layout and DOM APIs.

Over the last 11 years, these fuzzers have found 6450 Firefox bugs, including [790 bugs that were rated as security-critical](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?limit=0&bug_id=205735,306902,306915,307277,307444,307826,307989,307992,308917,309120,310267,310426,310436,310638,317544,317546,317549,321299,329335,329884,337419,338251,340733,347355,356325,359371,361389,365923,369438,374882,377470,377783,389326,393475,395340,399694,404215,411835,413079,413085,416734,421393,428113,429881,430991,443528,445288,449129,453406,453736,457514,460924,462968,466763,468578,473042,478527,481139,496011,496062,503699,505399,538062,538267,580151,590395,591409,604843,637214,674223,718290,791601,890775,306940,313086,316631,316639,316641,317520,322704,330486,336899,336999,337883,349974,353610,364427,367740,371563,373122,380359,391178,393956,395575,399951,400190,400223,400244,404118,406380,406485,408602,411213,413048,415685,420415,422301,423098,429960,430569,431086,436977,437142,437565,444864,448903,449111,452157,452165,454345,457375,459968,465651,467493,468563,471619,474075,476547,478128,493649,495875,497519,499862,513394,515811,534768,537645,542136,571995,576649,592118,612662,615149,664930,668941,686190,686193,735943,750575,751995,764176,804814,812665,325730,338391,338674,339494,359516,366128,367755,370791,398088,420429,420439,423355,424679,449006,471246,475133,564461,583957,674156,678818,711651,742237,793848,849597,326615,369249,369696,371124,371292,372046,382133,385096,395616,398492,404869,409811,417852,427196,436741,454704,462926,467210,475136,475185,503981,565604,596805,601699,602115,605672,606709,614499,616076,616913,626267,626280,626290,634055,636078,637621,642022,648206,660517,669228,670319,711616,714590,727330,736589,738769,743376,761422,763129,764289,766430,767273,769464,790854,806751,809674,812744,815010,822691,827468,842089,851987,851996,856384,865004,866570,867863,868265,872774,872812,873335,876080,895294,928221,933447,1072847,1153688,331284,331446,331679,331883,339651,345139,367243,372237,379799,380012,380101,380217,384649,385445,386266,388367,389630,395316,395623,399843,402380,404219,413185,413388,422283,429969,454751,455976,458653,459883,460349,460389,461239,462392,463350,472919,472950,476245,486428,495892,812929,879139,372284,382778,409990,424027,424276,424300,489477,499844,507566,546530,565125,636074,745494,772282,862309,871849,887631,339129,339130,339165,339246,339315,341227,343087,344000,346980,348062,350370,351328,358729,372376,378273,387460,404209,468771,343850,386566,397007,403454,451323,464197,465832,466607,466945,467881,479931,489925,500788,501535,535926,673757,706249,344228,344340,354645,360642,366956,373533,375399,376223,384105,394800,395331,415192,415503,444260,454736,460803,467481,344749,354777,380691,397704,420697,475181,495315,554141,639728,680687,686044,704706,348492,354766,375775,378146,382396,443089,494283,624198,348049,373586,377820,382376,383709,391904,420835,429458,432068,433429,471594,508927,561981,369150,369168,380512,459439,547333,377360,385423,394275,395458,395651,396321,410228,419095,421813,424629,428633,439206,472776,522374,660416,675515,732696,866544,380100,746896,790865,600109,606729,615763,622480,631488,633413,651030,654015,665996,692608,693250,693399,708825,790856,862606,883037,593867,623791,626835,626856,627286,628349,636921,657201,765179,814839,967354,1010090,790929,790949,791702,792068,794139,800969,801227,803842,805729,808546,808829,810626,811183,811184,812785,820990,824263,824960,828147,835835,836931,838169,839941,849888,856382,857256,862890,863929,1002340,1022945,855174,861472,863931,865550,867086,867104,867203,872394,875144,875221,875402,876207,876273,876338,877523,877527,878014,880342,880384,880404,880724,881775,882956,883591,898962,920987,894348,957452,991471,1005578,1020041,1035007,1033492,350238,350793,351116,352094,352271,352606,352616,352624,353079,353214,353249,354924,354945,355052,355474,355486,355512,355834,356378,356402,361346,361552,361617,375976,378492,379482,380833,381374,382503,387955,391033,391851,426520,427191,429739,431248,435497,452913,456692,457521,457580,458288,458679,458931,460886,461915,465063,465145,466206,466654,469405,469547,469621,470619,472533,472787,473040,473709,476257,476871,482783,485790,486713,486812,509354,510319,510434,514819,514999,520336,521169,525618,528048,528126,528507,528644,528870,531298,532491,539379,541255,546611,554670,558531,558633,559083,561031,561327,561539,563243,565373,566145,567059,567577,567606,568826,568855,569306,569384,571744,572232,572428,575486,576722,576737,576742,576744,578044,579273,579647,579740,580187,581784,581785,584650,586917,587725,589093,592202,592214,593583,593611,595230,596103,597940,600128,600139,600889,602139,605391,609256,613152,613160,613161,614782,616711,617288,618574,619004,621375,621943,622318,624421,625399,627682,627692,627783,629974,632206,639343,643839,662132,677032,690376,695896,698944,701239,702426,709929,717716,718823,726799,727921,728509,736609,740595,743000,755916,756851,757149,757304,758408,762324,768313,768732,769192,769433,770954,771398,777776,777992,779025,780274,780451,780712,780936,783924,78

I had to keep these fuzzers private for a long time because of the frequency with which they found security holes in Firefox. But three things have changed that have tipped the balance toward openness.

First, each area of Firefox has been through many fuzz-fix cycles. So now I'm mostly finding regressions in the Nightly [channel](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/05/firefox-and-the-release-channels/ "The Firefox channels: Nightly, Aurora (Dev), Beta, and Release"), and the severe ones are fixed well before they reach most Firefox users. Second, modern Firefox is much less fragile, thanks to architectural changes to areas that once oozed with fuzz bugs. Third, other security researchers have noticed my success and demonstrated that they can write similarly powerful fuzzers.

My fuzzers are no longer unique in their ability to find security bugs, but they are unusual in their ability to churn out reliable, reduced testcases. Each fuzzer alternates between randomly building a JS string and then `eval`ing it. This construction makes it possible to make a reproduction file from the same generated strings. Furthermore, most [DOMFuzz modules](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/tree/master/dom/fuzzer/modules) are designed so their functions will have the same effect even if other parts of the testcase are removed. As a result, [a simple testcase reduction tool](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/lithium/) can reduce most testcases from 3000 lines to 3-10 lines, and I can usually [finish reducing testcases](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/blob/master/dom/reducing-testcases.md) in less than 15 minutes.

The ease of getting reduced testcases lets me afford to report less severe bugs. Occasionally, one of these turns out to be a [security bug in disguise](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=489682#c5). But most importantly, these bug reports help me establish positive relationships with Firefox developers, by frequently saving them time.

A JavaScript engine developer can easily spend a day trying to figure out why a web site doesn't work in Firefox. If instead I can give them a simple testcase that shows an incorrect result with a new JS optimization enabled, they can quickly find the source of the bug and fix it. Similarly, they much prefer reliable assertion testcases over bug reports saying "sometimes, Google Maps crashes after a while".

As a result, instead of being [hostile to fuzzing](https://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2014/january/introduction-to-anti-fuzzing-a-defence-in-depth-aid/), Firefox developers actively help me fuzz their code. They've [added numerous assertions to their code](https://www.squarefree.com/2014/02/03/fuzzers-love-assertions/), allowing fuzzers to notice as soon as the smallest thing goes wrong. They've fixed most of the [bugs that impede fuzzing progress](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=sw:fuzzblocker). And several have suggested new ways to test their code, even (especially) ways that scare them.

Developers working on the JavaScript engine have been especially helpful. First, they ensured I could test their code directly, apart from the rest of the browser. They already had a [JavaScript shell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey/Introduction_to_the_JavaScript_shell) for running regression tests, and they added a `--fuzzing-safe` option to disable the more dangerous testing functions.

The JS team also created [a large set of testing functions](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=JS_FN_HELP) to let me [control things that would normally be based on heuristics](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/blob/master/js/shared/testing-functions.js). Fuzzers can now choose when garbage collection happens and even how much. They can make expensive [JITs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) kick in after 2 loop iterations rather than 100. Fuzzers can even [simulate out-of-memory conditions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=912928). All of these things make it possible to create small, reliable testcases for nasty classes of bugs.

Finally, the JS team has supported differential testing, a form of fuzzing where output is checked for correctness against some oracle. In this case, the oracle is the same JavaScript engine with most of its optimizations disabled. By [fixing inconsistencies quickly](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=js-differential-test) and [supporting `--enable-more-deterministic`](https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?q=JS_MORE_DETERMINISTIC), they've ensured that differential testing doesn't get stuck finding the same problems repeatedly.

[![Andreas Gal, a developer working on Firefox's JavaScript engine, once commented on Bugzilla: 'From this day forward, I shall never write a JIT again without Jesse.'](https://www.squarefree.com/blogimages/agal-vow.png)](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=457778#c2)

Please join us on IRC, or just [dive in and contribute](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/)! Your suggestions and patches can have a large impact: fuzzer modules often act together to find complex interactions within the browser. For example, [bug 893333](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=775106&action=edit "Testcase for bug 893333 - \"ASSERTION: damage area expanded incorrectly\" with table row/colspan, editor") was found by [my `designMode` module](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/blob/master/dom/fuzzer/modules/editor.js) interacting with [a `<table>` module](https://github.com/MozillaSecurity/funfuzz/blob/master/dom/fuzzer/modules/tables.js) contributed by a Firefox developer, Mats Palmgren. Likewise, [bug 1158427](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8597550&action=edit "Testcase for bug 1158427 - \"ASSERTION: Stream already destroyed\" and crash with mozCaptureStreamUntilEnded, cycle collection") was found by [Christoph Diehl](https://twitter.com/posidron)'s `WebAudio` module combined with my [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29)-based API-discovery modules.

To the next 6450 browser bug fixes!

## [Fuzzers love assertions](https://www.squarefree.com/2014/02/03/fuzzers-love-assertions/ "Permanent Link to Fuzzers love assertions")

February 3rd, 2014

Fuzzers make things go wrong.
Assertions make sure we find out.

[Assertions can improve code quality in many ways](http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1091), but they truly shine when combined with fuzzing. Fuzzing is normally limited to finding obvious symptoms like crashes, because it's [rare to be able to tell correct behavior from incorrect behavior when the input is generated randomly](http://www.squarefree.com/categories/differential-testing/). Assertions expand the scope of fuzzing to include everything they check.

Assertions can even help find crash bugs: some bugs are relatively easy for fuzzers to trigger, but only lead to crashes when additional conditions are met. A well-placed assertion can let us know every time we trigger the bug.

Fuzzing JS and DOM has found about 4000 assertion bugs, including [about 300 security bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20reporter%3Ajruderman%2Cgary%40rumb%2Ccholler%20kw%3Atestcase%20kw%3Aassertion%20%20-kw%3Acrash%20%20-kw%3Amlk%20%20sw%2Ckw%3Asec-critical%2Csec-high%2C%22sg%3Acritical%22%2C%22sg%3Ahigh%22).

### Asserting safe use of generic data structures

Assertions in widely-used data structures can find bugs in many callers.

* **Array indices must be within bounds**. This simple precondition assert in nsTArray has caught [about 90 bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20su%2Cdesc%3A%22invalid%20array%20index%22&order=bugs.bug_id%20desc).
* **Hash tables must not be modified during enumeration**. If the modification happened to resize the hash table, it would leave stack pointers dangling. This PLDHashTable assertion has caught [over 50 bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20su%2Cdesc%3Arecursion_level&order=bugs.bug_id%20desc).
* **Cached values should not be out of date**. When a cache's `get` method takes a key and a closure for computing values in the case of a cache miss, debug builds can check whether the cached values are still correct. This is effectively a form of [differential testing](http://www.squarefree.com/categories/differential-testing/) that notices bugs in cache-invalidation logic.

### Asserting module invariants

When [an entire module must maintain an invariant](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/Internals/Invariants), a single assertion can catch dozens of bugs.

* **Compartment mismatches.** When a JS object in one page's [compartment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/SpiderMonkey/SpiderMonkey_compartments) references an object in another, it must do so through a [wrappers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/XPConnect/XPConnect_security_membranes) that enforces security policies. Without these assertions, we would have missed [over 25 violations](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=ALL%20kw%3Atestcase%20su%3Acompartment%20kw%3Aassertion%20su%3Amism%2Cwrong&order=bugs.bug_id%20desc) of Firefox's script security model.
* **Phases of layout**. These assertions have strings like "Should be in an update while creating frames" and "reflowing in the middle of frame construction". [More phase and nesting assertions are wanted](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=335053,335054,355975,686402,858473), but sometimes [special cases like plugins get in the way](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=612662#c7).

### Making the frame arena safer

Gecko's CSS box objects, called "frames", are created and destroyed manually. They are allocated within an arena to reduce malloc overhead and fragmentation. The arena also made it possible to reduce the risk associated with manual memory management. A combination of assertions (in debug builds) and runtime mitigations (in all builds) mitigates dangling pointer bugs that involve frames.

* When the arena is destroyed, debug builds [assert that all objects in the arena were also destroyed](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=framedest). [Over 60 bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=334514&maxdepth=1&hide_resolved=0) have been caught by the assertion. About half of the bugs that trigger the assertion *can* lead to exploitable crashes, but without a specially crafted testcase, they will not crash at all.
* While the arena is still alive, deleted frames are overwritten with a special poison pattern. If any code uses a pointer from a deleted frame, the browser will segfault safely. This mitigation, called [frame poisoning](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2010/10/mitigating-dangling-pointer-bugs-using_15.html), has [prevented dozens of bugs from being exploitable](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=526587&maxdepth=1&hide_resolved=0).
* Writing over the poison trips another assertion. This assertion is actually more prone to catch [hardware errors](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=799091,775045,772725) than [software bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=561981,586389), so it has been [modified to help distinguish between the two](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=785737).

### Requests for Gecko developers

Please add assertions, especially when:

* A bug would be a security hole
* Crashing is not guaranteed
* Many callers must fulfill a precondition
* Complex, extensive code must maintain an invariant

Also consider:

* Ensure [assertions in third-party libraries](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=503190) are enabled in debug builds of Firefox.
* Fix [bugs requesting new assertions](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?v4=assert%20when&o5=substring&f10=short_desc&f1=keywords&o3=substring&v6=should%20assert&o7=substring&f8=OP&v3=assert%20if&o1=substring&j2=OR&o9=equals&resolution=---&v10=assert&o6=substring&v7=add%20assert&f9=bug_severity&n1=1&f4=short_desc&v5=assert%20that&query_format=advanced&o10=substring&v9=enhancement&f3=short_desc&f2=OP&o4=substring&f5=short_desc&v1=assertion&f6=short_desc&f7=short_desc).
* Fix [my assertion bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=reporter%3Ajruderman%20kw%3Aassertion%20kw%3Atestcase&order=bugs.bug_id%20desc) to [allow my fuzzers to find more](http://www.squarefree.com/2010/11/21/how-my-dom-fuzzer-ignores-known-bugs/).

## [Customizing the Mozilla Manifesto](https://www.squarefree.com/2013/12/17/customizing-the-mozilla-manifesto/ "Permanent Link to Customizing the Mozilla Manifesto")

December 17th, 2013

I have mixed feelings about [requiring Mozillians to â€œagreeâ€](http://hoosteeno.com/2013/12/17/a-new-mozillians-org-signup-process/) to the [Mozilla Manifesto](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/#principles). I get the impression that many volunteers arenâ€™t fond of â€œcommercial involvementâ€ (9). Firefox development often does not live up to the ideals of absolute security (4) or transparency (8), so weâ€™d be asking new contributors to commit to behavior for which they may have little support.

Meanwhile, the manifesto is oddly silent on two issues that many Mozillians care about deeply. First, it says little about privacy. â€œShaping your own experience on the Internetâ€ (5) suggests control over customized ads, but not control over tracking by advertisers or governments.

Second, the manifesto does not adequately address removing barriers to contribution or promoting inclusiveness in community processes. The relevant principles (6, 8) are worded as vague beliefs rather than strong values. Compare with [my favorite part](http://adainitiative.org/2012/10/jesse-ruderman-i-wanted-to-atone-for-years-of-thats-what-she-said-jokes/) of the [Ada Initiative FAQ](http://adainitiative.org/faq/#why-focus-on-women-in-open-technology-and-culture):

> â€œOpen technology and culture are shaping the future of global society. If we want that society to be socially just and to serve the interests of all people, [all kinds of people] must be involved in its creation and organization.â€

Rather than asking each Mozillian to agree to the entire manifesto, **letâ€™s instead encourage everyone to [Likert](https://twitter.com/jruderman/status/413186102250328064) the 10 existing principles and add a few of their own**.

Indicating how you feel about each principle is more memorable than clicking â€œAgreeâ€ once. Each Mozillian would have a personal version of the Manifesto to remind them what drives them to contribute. Such a survey could also lead to better understanding of the community and suggest improvements to the Manifesto.

## [Mobile apps for car-free living](https://www.squarefree.com/2012/04/16/car-free-apps/ "Permanent Link to Mobile apps for car-free living")

April 16th, 2012
![A man swings through the aisle of a train.](http://www.squarefree.com/blogimages/swings-on-bart.jpg)
[Swings on BART](http://www.flickr.com/photos/audreypenven/3482041699/) (photo by [Audrey Penven](http://audreypenven.net/))

Each of these apps makes transit more efficient or convenient. Together, they can do something almost magical: make transit *attractive* to urbanites who previously saw owning a car as a necessity.

#### Planning your trips

These apps try to find the best way to reach your destination by combining timetables from multiple transit agencies:

[Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)[[Learn more](http://www.google.com/intl/en/landing/transit/ "Using Google Maps for public transportation")] shows your current location along with walking, transit, or driving directions. In the iPhone app, you can double-tap the locator button to align the map with the iPhone's compass.

[HopStop](http://www.hopstop.com/search)[[iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/hopstop.com/id303217147 "HopStop for iOS") | [Android](http://hopstop.com/?action=mobile_android "HopStop for Android")] lets you specify whether you prefer trains or buses, and whether you prefer walking or waiting for a transfer. It shows a zoomed-in map for each transfer.

[Reroute.it](http://codeforamerica.org/?cfa_project=transportation-choices) lets you [quickly compare modes of transportation](http://codeforamerica.org/2011/09/27/introducing-reroute-it/) before getting directions.

#### Catching your ride

[Routesy](http://routesy.com/), [Nextime](http://nextransit.org/apps/nextime/), and [Nextbus](http://www.nextbus.com/homepage/) use real-time transit data to help you make quick decisions on familiar routes. For example, you'll know when to walk to your stop, when to run, and when to wait inside.

#### Not missing your stop

A location-based alarm, such as [Get Off Now](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/get-off-now%21-predictive-gps/id415576580?mt=8) or [GPSAlarms](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gpsalarms/id447537468?mt=8), can allow you to nap, read, or work without worrying about missing your stop.

These apps can run in the background and have surprisingly little effect on battery life. They use power-hungry GPS only when cell/wifi location data indicates that you are somewhat close.

#### Staying productive and entertained

One of the biggest advantages of public transportation is being able to [get things done](http://www.squarefree.com/2009/04/16/how-i-use-gtd/) while in transit. Some people check email, watch TV shows, or even [order from Chipotle](http://itunes.apple.com/app/chipotle-ordering/id327228455?mt=8) using their phones.

I often use time on the train to read articles. Whenever I find myself with [too many Wikipedia tabs open](http://xkcd.com/214/), I send them to my phone using the [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) or [Spool](https://getspool.com/) bookmarklet. Sometimes I read books on my phone using the [Amazon Kindle app](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000493771).

#### Getting a car when you need one

The [Zipcar app](http://www.zipcar.com/mobile/) lets you borrow cars from [Zipcar locations](http://www.zipcar.com/find-cars), while [Getaround](http://www.getaround.com/) lets you borrow cars from awesome neighbors.

Or you can pay for a ride using [Taxi Magic](http://taximagic.com/) or [Uber](https://www.uber.com/).

#### More reading

Some transit authorities recommend apps for their cities: [San Francisco](http://www.511.org/apps-3rd-party-apps.asp), [New York](http://www.nytransit.org/resources/transit-apps-ny), [Chicago](http://www.transitchicago.com/apps/), [Seattle](http://www.kingcounty.gov/transportation/kcdot/MetroTransit/Developers/AppCenter.aspx), and [Portland, Oregon](http://trimet.org/apps/).

In my next posts, I'll list my ideas for new transit apps and explain how platforms could better support location-aware apps.

## [Fuzzing for consistent rendering](https://www.squarefree.com/2012/03/03/fuzzing-for-consistent-rendering/ "Permanent Link to Fuzzing for consistent rendering")

March 3rd, 2012

My DOM fuzzer can now find bugs where the layout of a DOM tree depends on its history.

In this example, forcing a re-layout swapped a â€œ1â€ and â€œ3â€ on the screen. My fuzzer didnâ€™t know which rendering was correct, but it could tell that Firefox was being inconsistent.

| Initial DOM tree | * `DIV`   + ت   + `SPAN`     - 1     - `SPAN`- 3 | 31ت |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Random change: | * `DIV`   + ت   + `SPAN`     - 1     - 3 | 31ت |
| Force re-layout | * `DIV`   + ت   + `SPAN`     - 1     - 3 | 13ت |

Gecko developer [Simon Montagu](http://smontagu.org/) quickly [determined that 13ت is the correct rendering](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718236#c1) and attached a patch. Later, when a user [reported that the bug affected Persian comments on Facebook](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=730671), we were able to [backport Simonâ€™s fix to Firefox 11](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718236#c12).

#### How it works

The fuzzer starts by making random dynamic changes to a page. Then it compares two snapshots: one taken immediately after the dynamic changes, and another taken after also forcing a relayout.

To force a relayout, it removes the root from the document and then adds it back:

```

  var r = document.documentElement;
  document.removeChild(r);
  document.appendChild(r);

```

Like [reftest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Creating_reftest-based_unit_tests), it uses [drawWindow()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/CanvasRenderingContext2D#drawWindow%28%29) to take snapshots and [compareCanvases()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XPCOM_Interface_Reference/nsIDOMWindowUtils#compareCanvases%28%29) to compare them.

In theory, I could also look for bugs where dynamic changes do not repaint enough of the window. But I've been told that testing for painting invalidation bugs is tricky, so I'll wait until most of the layout bugs are fixed.

#### Exceptions

Since the testcases are random, I have to be heavy-handed in ignoring known bugs. If I file a rendering bug where the weirdest part of the testcase is floats, I'll have the fuzzer ignore inconsistent rendering in testcases with floats [until the bug is fixed](http://www.squarefree.com/2011/06/10/tracking-after-fix-tasks/).

The [current list of exceptions](http://pastebin.mozilla.org/1501141) is fairly large and includes key web technologies:

* CSS border/padding ([bug 718452](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=718452))
* CSS position: relative/absolute ([bug 728100](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=728100))
* CSS float ([bug 725928](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=725928))
* Non-ASCII text ([bug 726460](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=726460))
* Right-to-left text ([bug 730562](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=730562))
* <table> ([bug 467723](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=467723))
* MathML ([bug 522393](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=522393))
* SVG ([bug 723376](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=723376), [bug 475216](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=475216))
* Anything that causes [coordinate overflow](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=265084)
* Anything that causes assertion failures (which are [tracked separately](http://www.squarefree.com/2010/11/21/how-my-dom-fuzzer-ignores-known-bugs/))

## [Renting movies is hard](https://www.squarefree.com/2012/03/01/movie-rental/ "Permanent Link to Renting movies is hard")

March 1st, 2012

None of the major video rental systems appeal to me:

* [Redbox](http://www.redbox.com/) is for people who visit the grocery store two days in a row. (Why don't they put kiosks at train stations?)
* [Netflix DVD-by-mail](https://www.netflix.com/) is for people who watch lots of movies and check snail mail daily.
* [Amazon Instant Video](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000663511) is for people who live online, yet are willing to [give up control over their computers](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm_digital_restrictions_management).

The iTunes Store mostly works for my current set of devices, but all the movies I want to watch are either too new or too obscure for them to have rentals available.

Maybe I should sign up for Netflix but use [other means](https://thepiratebay.se/) to actually watch movies. At least then Hollywood will have enough money to ~~make good films~~ [buy politicians](http://rootstrikers.org/), print and distribute [billions](http://www.homemediamagazine.com/digital-copy/kevin-tsujihara-discs-key-driving-ultraviolet-adoption-26560) of [optical discs](https://twitter.com/#!/jruderman/status/175455285442379777), [prevent paying customers from exercising their fair use rights](https://www.eff.org/issues/drm), and [sue my neighbors](https://www.eff.org/issues/file-sharing).

## [I dream of Alpha](https://www.squarefree.com/2012/02/05/alpha/ "Permanent Link to I dream of Alpha")

February 5th, 2012

This museumâ€™s rooms are empty, waiting to be filled with answers to visitorsâ€™ questions.

![-](https://www.squarefree.com/blogimages/WAlogoSmallGreen.png)

In my search for nutrition, have I overlooked some fruit that I might find convenient and delicious? I start by trying to find out whatâ€™s popular throughout the world.

*What fruits are liked by the most people?* `Human thoughts are not my forte.`

*What fruits are eaten the most?* I get an answer, but not in the chart form I expected.

A row of fruit appears on the floor. The larger ones are shown both whole and sliced. Does the [five-second rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-second_rule) apply to food that suddenly appeared on the floor, or only to food that has been dropped? Am I looking at holograms?

A bigger problem is that the list is dominated by small fruits like berries. I donâ€™t like berries.

*What fruits are eaten the most, by weight?* `Insufficient data.`

I probe, using simpler questions, to figure out what it knows. *Whatâ€™s the weight of an apple?* `180 grams.` *Whatâ€™s the total weight of apples eaten in a year?* `Insufficient data.`

I guess I have to be explicit if I want it to combine its weight and consumption data.

*For each fruit for which you have sufficient data, chart the number eaten in a year, the average weight, and the product of the two.*

I donâ€™t get an answer right away. Is it just taking a while? Did I mangle the question, causing it to make a chart that is invisible because it has no entries? Did I confuse it with the phrase â€œthe product of the twoâ€?

![-](https://www.squarefree.com/blogimages/banana-from-clker-83002-tiny.png)

Two women are debating the merits of bananas. In this place, they arenâ€™t limited to speculation. *Can you chart fruit by potassium per Calorie? Vitamin B6 per dollar?* It helpfully highlights the â€œbananaâ€ row in each chart.

They explore the supply side as well. *Show me maps of where bananas are grown. Can you add a yearly animation with harvests shown as glowing dots? Draw a chart with axes for temperature and latitude, colored to show how well bananas grow in each condition.*

I start thinking of my own questions, but I donâ€™t expect it to be able to answer them. How do most people [open bananas](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Hdajei5i7Q)? How many bananas are used in recipes rather than eaten directly?

*How many bananas are used as sex toys?* Oops, did I ask that out loud?

It doesnâ€™t even acknowledge my question, but one of the women retorts with a question of her own.

*What percent of the time are men thinking about sex?* `Human thoughts are not my forte.`

![-](https://www.squarefree.com/blogimages/WAlogoSmall.png)

When I wake up, itâ€™s still dark outside.

Today, the closest thing to the museum of my dream is a web site called [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/). It can [chart](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=population+vs+GDP+per+capita+by+country) [many](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=temperature+in+mountain+view+CA+and+san+francisco+CA+during+2011) [things](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=apple+stock+price+from+1980+to+today). But it [requires](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=vehicles+in+california+%2F+population+of+california) [us](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=vehicles+per+capita+in+california) to [phrase](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=languages+by+number+of+native+speakers) [questions](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=languages+with+the+most+native+speakers) carefully, and sometimes it [simply](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=number+of+prisoners) [misinterprets](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=mass+of+250+gallons+of+gasoline) queries.

As for fruit? Wolfram Alpha has [consumption data for some fruit](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=worldwide+fruit+consumption). But [some fruit is missing](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=worldwide+consumption+of+peaches), and [some](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=worldwide+kiwi+consumption) [fruit](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=US+consumption+of+kiwis) [confuses](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28kiwi+fruit%29+US+consumption) it.

I start writing this post while eating the last two apples from my fridge.

I go back to bed, hoping for additional pleasant dreams.

## [Lessons from JS engine bugs](https://www.squarefree.com/2011/09/01/lessons-from-js-engine-bugs/ "Permanent Link to Lessons from JS engine bugs")

September 1st, 2011

Last week, I asked [Luke Wagner](http://blog.mozilla.com/luke/) to explain some security bugs that he fixed in the past. I hoped to [learn from each bug at multiple levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis), in ways that could help prevent future security bugs from arising and persisting.

Luke is one of the developers working on [Firefox's JavaScript engine](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey), which is currently our largest source of [critical](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings) security bugs.

#### Method

I imagined we would recurse in [exhaustive breadth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why-Because_analysis) and [exhausting depth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys). Instead, we recursed only on the most interesting items, and refined a checklist of starting points:

* What was the bug?
* What went wrong in the developer's thinking that caused the bug to be introduced?
* What made the bug exploitable?
* What caused us to use especially dangerous features of C++?
* Could a new abstraction make it possible to do this both fast and safe?
* What caused the bug to persist? Could we have caught this earlier with improved regression tests, fuzz testing, dynamic analysis, or static analysis?

Luke and I made **[trees for all ten bugs](http://www.squarefree.com/lessons-from-js-bugs.html)**, at first on paper and later using EtherPad. Then I extracted and categorized what I thought were the most useful lessons and recommendations.

#### Recommendations for introducing fewer bugs

Casts

* Create centralized, type-restricted cast functions. This protects you when you change the representation of one of the types. It also protects against mistakes that cause the input type to be incorrect.

Sentinel values

* Use tagged unions instead.
* Use a typed wrapper (a struct containing a single value). When assigning from the underlying numeric type, convert using one of two functions: one that checks for special values, and one that explicitly does not.
* Audit existing code paths to ensure they cannot generate the special value.

Clarity of invariants

* Increase use of [methods named AssertInvariants](http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/search?string=AssertInvariants)
* Create an alias for JS\_ASSERTION called JS\_INVARIANT.

Interacting with other developers

* If you're about to do something gross because someone else doesn't expose the right API/helper, maybe you should get it exposed.

JS Engine specific

* Any patch that touches rooting should be reviewed by Igor.
* Interpreter could have better abstraction and encapsulation for its stack.

#### Recommendations for catching bugs earlier

Static analysis

* Find all casts (C-style casts, the reinterpret\_cast keyword, and casts through unions) for a given type. Could be used to enforce centralization or to find things that should be centralized.
* Be suspicious of a function with multiple return statements, all of which return the same primitive value.
* Be suspicious of a function returning true/success in an OOM path.

Dynamic analysis

* Ask Valgrind developers what they think of providing (in valgrind.h) a way to tie the addressability of "stacklike memory" to a variable that represents the end of the stack.

Fuzzing

* We should fuzz [worker threads](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Worker) somehow.
  + In browser (slow and messy, but it's what users are running).+ In thread-safe shell (--enable-threadsafe?), which has "toy workers".
* We should fuzz compartments better.
  + I should ask Blake and Andreas for help with testing compartments and wrappers.
  + I should ask Gary to run jsfunfuzz in xpcshell, where I can test both same-origin and different-origin compartments, and thus get more interesting wrappers.
* We should give JS OOM fuzzing another shot.

#### Next steps

I'm curious if others have additional ideas for what could have prevented the ten bugs we looked at. For example, someone like [Jeff Walden](http://whereswalden.com/), who loves to write exhaustive regression tests, might have ideas that Luke and I did not consider.

I'd also like to do this kind of analysis with a other developers on bugs they have fixed.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
