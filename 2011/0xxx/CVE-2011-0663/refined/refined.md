{
  "CVE-2011-0663": {
    "Description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the JScript and VBScript scripting engines due to a memory corruption error. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the logged-on user.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the way that the JScript and VBScript scripting engines process scripts in Web pages. When the scripting engines attempt to reallocate memory while decoding a script in order to run it, an integer overflow can occur, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption vulnerability",
       "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted website",
      "Compromised websites",
      "Websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements",
      "Links in emails or Instant Messenger messages"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted website or compromise a legitimate website. They also need to convince users to visit the malicious site, often through social engineering tactics such as phishing emails or IM messages. No specific network position is required. An attacker with a low degree of skill could potentially create the exploit, but may have some difficulty."
