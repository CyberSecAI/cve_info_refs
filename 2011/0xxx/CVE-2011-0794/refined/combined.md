These vulnerabilities are in a third-party library (Oracle Outside In) and are documented in CERT-CC Vulnerability Note VU#520721 at <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/520721>leavingcisco.com  Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities.  No workaround is available to mitigate these vulnerabilities. This advisory is posted at <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20111026-csa>.  Affected Products  * Vulnerable ProductsThese vulnerabilities only affect 6.x versions of Cisco Security Agent running on Windows platforms.Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable No software releases of Cisco Security Agent running on Linux   platforms are affected. Software releases prior to 6.0 running on Windows   platforms are not affected by these vulnerabilities.  No other Cisco products are currently known to be affected by these vulnerabilities.  Details  * The Cisco Security Agent is a security software agent that provides threat protection for server and desktop computing systems. Cisco Security Agents can be standalone agents or can be managed by the Cisco Security Agent Management Center.       Version 6.x of Cisco Security Agent running on Windows platforms is affected by the following vulnerabilities:   + Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.3.5.0 allows local users to affect availability, related to File ID SDK.     This vulnerability is assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) IDs CVE-2011-0794   + Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.3.2.0 and 8.3.5.0 allows local users to affect availability via vectors related to Outside In Filters.

# Security Vulnerability in Oracle "Outside-In" (Lotus 123 & Microsoft CAB) viewers used by GroupWise

* **Document ID:***7009213*
* **Creation Date:**19-Aug-2011
* **Modified Date:**29-Apr-2013
* + **Micro Focus Products:**GroupWise

## Environment

 Novell GroupWise 8.0x up to (and including) 8.02HP2
## Situation

 Vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle "Outside In" technology used by GroupWise to view Lotus 123 and Microsoft CAB file attachments that could potentially allow an unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code. These issues were reported to Novell by Will Dormann at US-CERT (<http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/520721>).
See also Oracle's April 2011 "Critical Patch Update Advisory" at <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2011-301950.html>
## Resolution

 To resolve this issue, apply GroupWise 8.0 Hot Patch 3 (HP3) or later.

Previous versions of GroupWise are likely also vulnerable but are no longer supported. Customers on earlier versions of GroupWise should, at a minimum, upgrade their GWIAs and associated Domains to version 8.02HP3 in order to secure their system.

## Oracle Outside In contains exploitable vulnerabilities in Lotus 123 and Microsoft CAB file parsers

#### Vulnerability Note VU#520721

Original Release Date: 2011-04-19 | Last Revised: 2014-04-28

---

### Overview

Oracle Outside In contains exploitable vulnerabilities in Lotus 123 and Microsoft CAB file parsers, which can allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| [Oracle Outside In](http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/embedded/025613.htm) is a set of libraries that can decode over 500 different file formats. Originally written by Stellent, [Outside In is now part of Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/stellent/index.html). The Oracle Outside In libraries are used by a variety of applications, including Oracle Fusion Middleware, Google Search Appliance, Guidance Encase Forensics, AccessData FTK, and Novell Groupwise.  Outside In fails to properly handle Lotus 123 and Microsoft CAB file data, which are handled on the Windows platform by the libraries vswk6.dll and sccut.dll, respectively. The Linux version of Outside In uses libvs\_wk6.so and libsc\_ut.so. Other supported platforms may use different file names.The CAB file parser may be used when handling a variety of file formats, including Microsoft OneNote (.onepkg).Limited testing has shown that the Lotus 123 parser in Outside In versions 8.1.0.4037 through 8.3.5.5684 are vulnerable. Previous versions may also be affected. The CAB file identification vulnerability appears to only affect 8.3.5.x versions through 8.3.5.5684. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By causing an application to process a specially-crafted file with the Oracle Outside In library, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Depending on what application is using Outside In, this may happen as the result of some user interaction, such as single-clicking on a file, or it may happen with no user interaction at all. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**These vulnerabilites are addressed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware [Critical Patch Update April 2011](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2011-301950.html). This update provides updated libraries with versions 8.3.5.5927 and 8.3.2.5927, for the Outside in 8.3.5 and 8.3.2 product lines, respectively. Please see [Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](http://support.oracle.com/CSP/main/article?cmd=show&type=NOT&id=1291877.1) (valid Oracle CSI# required) for more details. If you are using an application that uses Outside In, please check with that application's vendor for updates. If updates for your application are not yet available, or if you wish to mitigate other vulnerabilities in Outside In, please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Use the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit**The [Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=c6f0a6ee-05ac-4eb6-acd0-362559fd2f04) (EMET) can be used to help prevent exploitation of this and other vulnerabilities.**Enable DEP in Microsoft Windows**Consider enabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP) in supported versions of Windows. DEP should not be treated as a complete workaround, but it can mitigate the execution of attacker-supplied code in some cases. Microsoft has published detailed technical information about DEP in Security Research & Defense blog posts "Understanding DEP as a mitigation technology" [part 1](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/05/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-1.aspx) and [part 2](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/archive/2009/06/12/understanding-dep-as-a-mitigation-technology-part-2.aspx). DEP should be used in conjunction with the application of patches or other mitigations described in this document.Note that when relying on DEP for exploit mitigation, it is important to use a system that supports Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) as well. ASLR is not supported by Windows XP or Windows Server 2003 or earlier. ASLR was introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. Please see the Microsoft SRD blog entry: [On the effectiveness of DEP and ASLR](http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2010/12/08/on-the-effectiveness-of-dep-and-aslr.aspx) for more details. |

### [MarkLogic Corporation](#WDON-8G9N8Y) Affected

Notified:  August 08, 2011  Updated: August 26, 2011

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

MarkLogic Corporation acknowledges CERT Vulnerability Notes VU#103425 and
VU#520721 and confirms that an affected version of Oracle Outside In is bundled
and shipped with MarkLogic Server versions 4.0, 4.1 and 4.2.  Outside In file
conversion is a keyed option in MarkLogic Server.  The Outside In converters
cannot be accessed from within the MarkLogic Server programming environment
without an installed license key that enables the Outside In conversion
option.  The Outside In conversion option for MarkLogic Server has not been
advertised and circulation is highly restricted.  Therefore, the security risk
imposed by the bundled Outside In utility on the MarkLogic user community is
extremely limited.

Regardless, the affected Outside In libraries have been removed from MarkLogic
Server 4.1 (4.1-11) and 4.2 (4.2-6) and will be absent in all future
maintenance releases for those codelines.  Further, Outside In will be removed
entirely from upcoming MarkLogic Server version 5.0.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 2.0 |
| Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/CDP:ND/TD:ND/CR:ND/IR:ND/AR:ND |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Access Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent Network AV: Network  Access Complexity AC: High AC: Medium AC: Low  Authentication Au: Multiple Au: Single Au: None  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Partial C: Complete  Integrity Impact I: None I: Partial I: Complete  Availability Impact A: None A: Partial A: Complete     Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploitability E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   **Exploitability**  ---   Unproven (U) No exploit code is available, or an exploit is entirely theoretical. Proof-of-Concept (POC) Proof-of-concept exploit code or an attack demonstration that is not practical for most systems is available. The code or technique is not functional in all situations and may require substantial modification by a skilled attacker.  Functional (F) Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.  High (H) Either the vulnerability is exploitable by functional mobile autonomous code, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available. The code works in every situation, or is actively being delivered via a mobile autonomous agent (such as a worm or virus).  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   **Remediation Level**  ---   Official Fix (OF)  A complete vendor solution is available. Either the vendor has issued an official patch, or an upgrade is available. Temporary Fix (TF) There is an official but temporary fix available. This includes instances where the vendor issues a temporary hotfix, tool, or workaround.  Workaround (W)  There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available. In some cases, users of the affected technology will create a patch of their own or provide steps to work around or otherwise mitigate the vulnerability.  Unavailable (U)  There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.  Not Defined (ND)  Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.  Report Confidence RC: Unconfirmed  RC: Uncorroborated  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   **Report Confidence**  ---   Unconfirmed (UC) There is a single unconfirmed source or possibly multiple conflicting reports. There is little confidence in the validity of the reports. An example is a rumor that surfaces from the hacker underground. Uncorroborated (UR) There are multiple non-official sources, possibly including independent security companies or research organizations. At this point there may be conflicting technical details or some other lingering ambiguity.  Confirmed (C) The vulnerability has been acknowledged by the vendor or author of the affected technology. The vulnerability may also be ?Confirmed? when its existence is confirmed from an external event such as publication of functional or proof-of-concept exploit code or widespread exploitation.  Not Defined (ND) Assigning this value to the metric will not influence the score. It is a signal to the equation to skip this metric.     Temporal Score: 8.3 |

| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Collateral Damage Potential CDP: None  CDP: Low  CDP: Low-Medium  CDP: Medium-High  CDP: High  CDP: Not Defined   Target Distribution TD: None  TD: Low  TD: Medium  TD: High  TD: Not Defined   Confidentiality Requirement CR: Not Defined  CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High   Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Availability Requirement AR: Not Defined  AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High      Environmental Score: 8.3 |
