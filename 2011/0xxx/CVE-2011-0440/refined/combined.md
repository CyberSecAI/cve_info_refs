## Changelog

View the full changelog

Check sesskey when deleting blogs ([bug #676336](/bugs/676336))

Escape error message in select box validation ([bug #710428](/bugs/710428))

html export: create dirs for static files overridden in themes ([bug #672806](/bugs/672806))

Corrected the relationship value "is\_supported\_by" to "supported\_by". Since

this typo has already been introduced with the first LEAP2A implementation,

the import had to be adapted to allow both versions for backwards

compatibility.

Fixed encoding issue in LEAP2A export: Accented characters in views were

garbled in the export.

Fixed some problem in the LEAP2A export: - added missing namespace in

attribute value - changed attribute value 'is\_supported\_by' to the correct

'supported\_by'

Leap2: Fixed category namespace in import as well as export

leap2a: added trailing / on the end of categories namespace in xml header

Removing code I inadvertantly committed that wasn't originally in 1.2

leap2a another 1.2/1.3 refactor regression

patches

leap2a: import the contents tag into a file description

leap2a import: removed a non used line of code from a refactor

use the leaptype namespace on import to check rdf type, not leap2 namespace

leap2: improved some error reporting for importing content

Made the blog attachment importer use the static method to detect files

Made static LeapImportFile::is\_file method public

The categories namespace is now stored in a property since it is dependent on

the leap2a version. A method was added to return the categories namespace.

removed xpath query that caused namespace warnings

fixed hard coded namespace attribute

Leap2A support for files inside enclosures

php 5.3 bugfix: accessing child member variables has changed

Pass exporter links to static method by reference when exporting comments (bug

added the "updated" field to all export elements in the resume

leap2a updates: change the exporter to use links with enclosure

added missing phpdoc to chagend and new functions

adapted the LEAP2A import to handle both LEAP2A versions (2009-03 and 2010-07)

changed namespaces to comply with LEAP2A 2010-07, added a version element to

the atom feed

Leap2a xhtml support: removed unecessary <tmp> elememnt

Leap2a xhtml support:

leap2a xhtml fix: when replacing images, close them with />

Leap2a fix for inline images with resize parameters:

Fixes to the leap2a entry export template:

Added an optional parameter to clean\_html to use xhtml.

leap2a: export has\_part relationships inside structured content with the

correct namespace

leap2a: changed fields in the base import class to protected, as they should

be

leap2a #528423 changed the structured content replacement to deal with

attachments

leap2a #528423 make the blog importer import attached files

Leap importer: fixed the default fallback import strategy a bit

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Create portfolios

Using Mahara, students and staff create their personal learning stories by uploading evidence of activities they have participated in, and embedding publicly accessible content they have previously put online. They can write reflections on their experiences that frame this evidence, map it to competencies or registration requirements, and provide necessary context.

Mahara can be used for many different portfolio purposes, such as study, professional development, work-integrated learning, assessment, showcase and presentation, and employability.

[Learn about the portfolio options](https://mahara.org/view/view.php?id=137010)

## Share work

Mahara allows portfolios to be shared flexibly with one person, a specific group of people, or the entire world. Access can be further restricted to a particular time frame or just within an assessment task.

![Continuous single line drawing of a group of people sitting around a laptop in discussion](https://mahara.org/theme/mahara-org/images/dashboard-group-desktop.svg)

## Engage with others

Mahara makes it easy to comment and give feedback. Portfolios can also be submitted to learning management systems via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) for marking.

Groups in Mahara allow people to create portfolios collaboratively and engage in forum discussions.

Mostly thanks to Stacey who put together these two releases, you can now download Mahara 1.2.7 and 1.3.4 from the usual places:

<https://launchpad.net/mahara/1.2/1.2.7/>

<https://launchpad.net/mahara/1.3/1.3.4/>

These releases contain two security fixes: [CVE-2011-0440](http://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=3206) and [CVE-2011-0439](http://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=3205). We strongly recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible.

Other changes include Leap2A and PHP 5.3 fixes. See the [release notes](http://wiki.mahara.org/Release_Notes) for the full details.

### [Mahara 1.3.5 and 1.2.8 released](#post14122)

28 March 2011, 21:15

Unfortunately, a new version of HTML Purifier which includes several [security fixes](http://mahara.org/interaction/forum/topic.php?id=1985) was released 2 days after the last Mahara stable release.

We apologize to those who have already taken the time to upgrade their sites, but the public release of this new version of HTML Purifier has left us with no other choice but to issue new security releases of Mahara:

<https://launchpad.net/mahara/1.2/1.2.8/>

<https://launchpad.net/mahara/1.3/1.3.5/>

Package        : mahara
Vulnerability  : several
CVE IDs        : CVE-2011-0439 CVE-2011-0440
Debian-specific: no

Two security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mahara, a fully
featured electronic portfolio, weblog, resume builder and social
networking system:

CVE-2011-0439

    A security review commissioned by a Mahara user discovered that
    Mahara processes unsanitized input which can lead to cross-site
    scripting (XSS).

CVE-2011-0440

    Mahara Developers discovered that Mahara doesn't check the session
    key under certain circumstances which can be exploited as
    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and can lead to the deletion of
    blogs.

For the old stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny8.

For the stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.7.

We recommend that you upgrade your mahara package.
