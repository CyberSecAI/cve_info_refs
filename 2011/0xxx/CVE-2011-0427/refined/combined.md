Debian Security Advisory DSA-2148-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                        Moritz Muehlenhoff
January 17, 2011                       <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : tor
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0427

The developers of Tor, an anonymizing overlay network for TCP, found
three security issues during a security audit. A heap overflow allowed
the execution of arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0427), a denial of service
vulnerability was found in the zlib compression handling and some key
memory was incorrectly zeroed out before being freed. The latter two
issues do not yet have CVE identifiers assigned. The Debian Security
Tracker will be updated once they're available:
<http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/tor>

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.29-1~lenny+1.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.29-1.

For the experimental distribution, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.21-alpha-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Organization

The Tor Project is not a horizontal organization but we try to make decisions as democratic as possible. We have a [structure](/tpo/team/-/wikis/work-relationships) where we operate and maintain the different pieces of software in teams. Our teams meet once a week to coordinate work and also meet frequently to coordinate projects. We have a [project manager](/tpo/team/-/wikis/Process/HowProjectManagementAtTheTorProject) that facilitates the coordination and keeps an eye on the roadmaps to get to deadlines on time.

In 2018, the Executive Director at the Tor Project and set the following goals for the next 3 to 5 years, for the organization and its projects:

**A Mature Tor Project (organization)**

* Stable income flows from a diverse funding base
* Diverse and robust organization that meets our needs
* Strong organizational culture focuses on employees and volunteers happiness
* Global brand recognition - Tor means strong privacy

**Full Access (product/projects)**

* Any person on the planet can access the Tor network
* Any person on the planet can use the Tor network to access any websites or services online
* Ensure the Tor network is diverse, healthy, stable, and scalable

~~As of August 2021, we started to implement ~~[~~OKRs~~](/tpo/team/-/wikis/okrs/home)~~ to set goals per team and role and track outcomes and organize the work ahead. Each team lead has setup OKRs with help of their team (you can find them in each team's wiki) as well as Roger for the ~~[~~areas he is working on~~](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/arma)~~.~~

# Community Council

The [Community Council](/tpo/team/-/wikis/Community-Council) is an elected body of Tor Core Contributors who are available to help resolve intra-community disputes.

# Meetings

We run public [meetings](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/Meetings) for all teams in irc and not secret but not public meetings in Big Blue Button for specific projects.

## All Hands

We run weekly internal meetings with this schedule:

* Every two months we have a financial update.
* Every three months we run a demo day.
* Quarterly we revisit priorities.
* Quarterly we do a [retrospective](/tpo/team/-/wikis/Retrospective-Template).

We have Tor DEMO days every three months. Here you can read [notes on past DEMOs](/tpo/team/-/wikis/DEMONotes).

# Tor 0.2.1.29 is released (security patches)

by erinn | January 17, 2011

![](../static/images/lead.png)

Tor 0.2.1.29 continues our recent code security audit work. The main

fix resolves a remote heap overflow vulnerability that can allow remote

code execution. Other fixes address a variety of assert and crash bugs,

most of which we think are hard to exploit remotely.

**All Tor users should upgrade.**

<https://www.torproject.org/download/download>

Changes in version 0.2.1.29 - 2011-01-15

**Major bugfixes (security):**

* Fix a heap overflow bug where an adversary could cause heap

  corruption. This bug probably allows remote code execution

  attacks. Reported by "debuger". Fixes CVE-2011-0427. Bugfix on

  0.1.2.10-rc.
* Prevent a denial-of-service attack by disallowing any

  zlib-compressed data whose compression factor is implausibly

  high. Fixes part of bug 2324; reported by "doorss".
* Zero out a few more keys in memory before freeing them. Fixes

  bug 2384 and part of bug 2385. These key instances found by

  "cypherpunks", based on Andrew Case's report about being able

  to find sensitive data in Tor's memory space if you have enough

  permissions. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre9.

**Major bugfixes (crashes):**

* Prevent calls to Libevent from inside Libevent log handlers.

  This had potential to cause a nasty set of crashes, especially

  if running Libevent with debug logging enabled, and running

  Tor with a controller watching for low-severity log messages.

  Bugfix on 0.1.0.2-rc. Fixes bug 2190.
* Add a check for SIZE\_T\_MAX to tor\_realloc() to try to avoid

  underflow errors there too. Fixes the other part of bug 2324.
* Fix a bug where we would assert if we ever had a

  cached-descriptors.new file (or another file read directly into

  memory) of exactly SIZE\_T\_CEILING bytes. Fixes bug 2326; bugfix

  on 0.2.1.25. Found by doorss.
* Fix some potential asserts and parsing issues with grossly

  malformed router caches. Fixes bug 2352; bugfix on Tor 0.2.1.27.

  Found by doorss.

**Minor bugfixes (other):**

* Fix a bug with handling misformed replies to reverse DNS lookup

  requests in DNSPort. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha. Related to a

  bug reported by doorss.
* Fix compilation on mingw when a pthreads compatibility library

  has been installed. (We don't want to use it, so we shouldn't

  be including pthread.h.) Fixes bug 2313; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
* Fix a bug where we would declare that we had run out of virtual

  addresses when the address space was only half-exhausted. Bugfix

  on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
* Correctly handle the case where AutomapHostsOnResolve is set but

  no virtual addresses are available. Fixes bug 2328; bugfix on

  0.1.2.1-alpha. Bug found by doorss.
* Correctly handle wrapping around when we run out of virtual

  address space. Found by cypherpunks, bugfix on 0.2.0.5-alpha.

**Minor features:**

* Update to the January 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.
* Introduce output size checks on all of our decryption functions.

**Build changes:**

* Tor does not build packages correctly with Automake 1.6 and earlier;

  added a check to Makefile.am to make sure that we're building with

  Automake 1.7 or later.
* The 0.2.1.28 tarball was missing src/common/OpenBSD\_malloc\_Linux.c

  because we built it with a too-old version of automake. Thus that

  release broke ./configure --enable-openbsd-malloc, which is popular

  among really fast exit relays on Linux.
