## CVE-2011-0979 Analysis

*   **Relates to CVE:** YES

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper management of data structure members in Microsoft Excel when parsing a specially crafted Excel file. Specifically, when parsing an Office Art object record, an error can lead to a stray reference being added to an element within a linked list.

*   **Vulnerability:** Linked list corruption. The application doesn't properly manage the members of a data structure, leading to a corrupted linked list.

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts a malicious Excel file. The user must open this specially crafted file. In a web-based attack, the attacker hosts the file on a website and convinces the user to visit the site and open the file. In an email attack, the attacker sends the file as an attachment.

*   **Impact:** Remote code execution. A successful exploit allows the attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. This could lead to complete control of the affected system, allowing the attacker to install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious Excel file and convince a user to open it. They do not need to be authenticated.

*   **Affected Products:** Microsoft Office Excel 2002, 2003, 2007, 2010, Office for Mac 2004, 2008, and 2011, Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, Excel Viewer, and Office Compatibility Pack.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Applying the Microsoft update released in April 2011.
    *   Using Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of older Excel formats from untrusted sources.
    *   Using the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE).
    *   Avoiding opening untrusted or unexpected Excel files.
