# Greenbone OpenVAS

OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner. Its capabilities
include unauthenticated and authenticated testing, various high-level
and low-level internet and industrial protocols, performance tuning
for large-scale scans and a powerful internal programming language
to implement any type of vulnerability test.

The scanner obtains the tests for detecting vulnerabilities from a
[feed](https://www.greenbone.net/en/feed-comparison/) that
has a long history and daily updates.

OpenVAS has been developed and driven forward by the company
[Greenbone](https://www.greenbone.net/en/) since 2006. As part of the commercial
vulnerability management product family Greenbone Enterprise Appliance,
the scanner forms the
[Greenbone Community Edition](https://greenbone.github.io/docs/latest/background.html#architecture)
together with other open-source modules.
