Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0063:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a directory traversal flaw in the `help` command of Majordomo2. The initial fix for a related vulnerability (CVE-2011-0049) used a regex (`$file =~ s!/?\.\./?!!g;`) to remove "../" from the input filename. However, this could be bypassed by using "./.../", which would be transformed to "../" after the regex was applied.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker could use specially crafted input to traverse directories and access files outside of the intended help file directory.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The initial fix used a flawed regex that could be easily bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`.
- **Information Disclosure:** The ability to read files could lead to the disclosure of sensitive system or application configuration information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited through a specially crafted HTTP request to the `mj_wwwusr` CGI script with the `func=help` parameter and a malicious path in the `extra` parameter.
- **SMTP Command:** The vulnerability can also be exploited through the `help` command via SMTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through HTTP or SMTP.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable system**: The attacker must have knowledge of a vulnerable majordomo2 installation.
- **Ability to send HTTP/SMTP requests**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web server or send SMTP commands to the mail server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nikolas Sotiriu.
- The initial fix for CVE-2011-0049 was insufficient and the bypass was reported to the security team at Mozilla.
- The fix was updated to use `$file =~ s!\.\.!!g;` which removes all occurrences of ".."
- A public advisory was released to notify majordomo2 users to patch their systems.
