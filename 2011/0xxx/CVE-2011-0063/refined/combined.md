Nikolas Sotiriu <nsotiriu@sotiriu.de> reported the following issue to security@ concerning a way to bypass the majordomo2 fix in [bug 628064](/show_bug.cgi?id=628064 "VERIFIED FIXED - Directory traversal in majordomo2's 'help' command"):
=================================================================
So the bug is that the majordomo2 path for the bug (628064) is absolut
terrible and not working.
See [attachment 506481](/attachment.cgi?id=506481 "Quick fix") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=506481&action=edit "Quick fix") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=506481&action=diff "Quick fix") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=628064&attachment=506481).
Check the regex ($file =~ s!/?\.\./?!!g;) do you see it :)
It deletes ../ but what happens if i ./.../ ?
./.../ becomes ../
<http://bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?passw=&list=GLOBAL&user=&func=help&extra=./..././..././..././..././..././..././..././.../etc/passwd>
Maybe a regex like this is better:
$file =~ s/\.\.//g;

"absolut terrible and not working". Wow. I'm in here helping folks fix code I haven't worked on in years, and honestly think I deserve something better than abuse.
Now, great, that's clever and I never would have found it. Sure wish someone could just communicate with me directly instead of flaming me in bugs I'm lucky to actually see. I've committed a fix.

He mailed it to our security@, probably didn't know you were on the bug (didn't post it there anyway). Doesn't excuse the "verbal abuse" anyway. I still appreciate you taking the time to help with this. :)

I'm still not 100% sure on that regexp. I know I've seen this done in other apps and I'm pretty sure the regexp was different. But I can't put my finger on it, and I haven't managed to break this one yet.

Well, there are other possibilities. Getting too clever by half in trying to strip out dots next to slashes obviously wasn't the right thing to do. If you come up with something better I'm happy to use it.
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1734145/is-this-specific-path-concatenation-in-perl-code-exploitable> seems to be somewhat on point. I could also detect any double-dot anywhere and instead of trying to manipulate the string just replace thw whole thing with the error document.
Anyway, always open to suggestions. I make no claims at all to being any kind of security professional.

Guess I'll own this for now, it's paging for being unassigned for too long at critical severity. :)Assignee: server-ops → justdave

Sorry for that. i didn't know that this would make you so angry. It was not my intention to criticize your help to fix the problem.
The point was, that i'm not a perl programmer (just used it for some
exploits) but i directy saw that this patch didn't work.
So sorry again for the "verbal abuse"
BTW: Nice that the email was posted here, but the last passage is missing

It looks like a new snapshot is out, which has the fixed regex <http://ftp.mj2.org/pub/mj2/snapshots/2011-02/majordomo-20110204.tar.gz>
What about the public disclosure?

justdave and cshields, can you get someone to mark this fixed, do the verfication including possible side cases.
then it seem appropriate for us to start the disclosure process so other users can start patching.

Fix has been live on our site for a while, we were just waiting to determine if it was still exploitable by any means, and we haven't found anything yet. opsec should verify, they're better at the xss testcases.Status: NEW → RESOLVEDClosed: 14 years agoResolution: --- → FIXED

FWIW, this has already been disclosed to most majordomo2 users via the mj2-dev mailing list (which since it never actually got released, the majority of the admins are subscribed to it as the only real source of info about it) on February 5th. <http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.mail.majordomo.majordomo2.devel/4057>

Should i wait for this verification? or is it ok to release the advisory?

I can't find obvious methods of bypassing the regex, but that doesn't provide a lot of assurance since there are so many edge cases.
Let me turn this approach around a bit. Could we specify a whitelist of allowed names for the "extra" parameter? For example [a-zA-Z0-9]? We could even through in the / character to support subdirectories.
This approach provides a lot more confidence.

my $id = $cgi->param('id');
if ($id) {
# Be careful not to allow directory traversal.
if ($id =~ /\.\./) {
# two dots in a row is bad
ThrowCodeError("bad\_page\_cgi\_id", { "page\_id" => $id });
}
# Split into name and ctype.
$id =~ /^([\w\-\/\.]+)\.(\w+)$/;
if (!$2) {
# if this regexp fails to match completely, something bad came in
ThrowCodeError("bad\_page\_cgi\_id", { "page\_id" => $id });
}
This is how bugzilla is handling the directory traversal problem.

I'd argue against a more complex regex. This becomes more difficult to reliably verify. Also, this code appears to be serving a slightly different purpose.

We need to mark this as "Verified" before we can publicly release any info. I'll have this wrapped up by tomorrow (3/8/11)

As mentioned in [comment 17](/show_bug.cgi?id=631307#c17 "VERIFIED FIXED - Possible to bypass fix for CVE-2011-0049 (majordomo2 directory traversal in 'help' command)"), it was already disclosed via Majordomo2's channels on February 5th.

Found Date: 03.02.2011
Date Reported: 03.02.2011
Release Date: 19.02.2011
Author: Nikolas Sotiriu
Mail: nso-research at sotiriu.de
Website: http://sotiriu.de/
Twitter: http://twitter.com/nsoresearch
Advisory-URL: http://sotiriu.de/adv/NSOADV-2011-003.txt
Vendor/Project: http://www.mj2.org/
Affected Products: majordomo2 <= 20110203
Remote Exploitable: Yes
Local Exploitable: No
Patch Status: Vendor released a patch (See Solution)
Discovered by: Nikolas Sotiriu
Disclosure Policy: http://sotiriu.de/policy.html
Thanks to: Thierry Zoller: For the permission to use his
Policy
Background:
===========
Majordomo 2 is an upwardly-compatible rewrite of the popular majordomo
mailing list manager software by Jason Tibbitts and Michael Yount.
Description:
============
Majordomo2 <= 20110203 is affected by a Directory Traversal
vulnerability due to parameter 'extra' of the 'help' command in the
function '\_list\_file\_get()' is not properly sanitized.
The original bug was made public on 03.02.2011 by Michael Brooks
of sitewat.ch:
https://sitewat.ch/en/Advisory/View/1
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=628064
I discovered, that the patch, which is in the CVS since version 20110125
don't protect against the Directory Traversal bug.
https://bug628064.bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=506481
The diff build in the regex '$file =~ s!/?\.\./?!!g;', which deletes
'../' from $file. Bypassing this regex is quiet simple by using './.../'
insted '../'.
Proof of Concept :
==================
HTTP:
http:///cgi-bin/mj\_wwwusr?passw=&list=GLOBAL&user=&func=help&
extra=./..././..././..././..././..././..././..././.../etc/passwd
SMTP:
help ./..././..././..././..././..././..././..././.../etc/passwd
Solution:
=========
Update to Majordomo2 >= 20110204

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
