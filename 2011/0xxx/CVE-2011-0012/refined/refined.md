Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0012:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `spice-xpi` component used a predictable name for the `usbrdrctl` log file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Symlink Attack:** A malicious user could exploit the predictable log file name by creating a symbolic link (symlink) to an arbitrary file.
- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** When `spice-xpi` writes to the log file, it would follow the symlink, allowing a malicious user to overwrite any file they have write access to, with the privileges of the user running `spice-xpi`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to overwrite arbitrary files, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker performs the overwrite operation with the privileges of the user running spice-xpi.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack requires local access to the system where `spice-xpi` is running.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to create a symlink pointing to the target file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker must be able to create symlinks.
- The attacker must know the predictable name of the log file used by `spice-xpi`.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via RHSA-2011:0426.
- The bug report indicates a "low" priority and "low" severity.
