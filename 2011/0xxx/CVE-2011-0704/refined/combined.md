| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c0)  Andrew Kerr    2011-02-04 21:36:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 477123](attachment.cgi?id=477123 "Stack trace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=477123&action=edit "Stack trace") Stack trace  Description of problem: The process on the replica crashes.  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): A master server running 1.2.7.5, replicating to a server running 1.2.7.5.  Same hardware and software installation.  How reproducible: Every time.  We have 10 replicas.  Each one running 1.2.7.5 will crash after some amount of time (few minutes to an hour).  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Enable replication from 1.2.7.5 master to 1.2.7.5 slave 2. Initialize replica (this I believe works fine with no crash every time) 3. Allow queries against replica 4. Replica will crash, some times almost immediately and some times after 30 or so minutes.    Actual results:   Expected results:  Additional info: All servers running a pretty bare installation of CentOS 5.5 with all updates.  Nothing relevant in the access or error logs (at level 8192), although I haven't turned off access log buffering yet.  I can't tell yet if it is query related, replication related, or something else.  Same servers rolled back to version 1.2.4 do not crash (master left at 1.2.7.5, still stable).  The server running 1.2.7.5 also gets end-user queries, so the data and queries being the same, the only difference is that one is a master and the others are replicas, with only the replicas crashing.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c1)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-09 15:38:56 UTC  ``` I was able to reproduce the crash with openldap ldapmodify on EL5.  1) You have to have a client capable of sending an empty modify request - mozldap ldapmodify will not let you do this, but openldap ldapmodify will:  # /usr/bin/ldapmodify -x <<EOF dn:  EOF  It will warn, but allow the modify through.  2) You have to be using a server built with mozldap - servers built with openldap will return an LDAP error when receiving an empty modify request  3) Either the modify operation is replicated, or the server has set cn=config nsslapd-lastmod: off  If these conditions are met, the empty modify operation will crash the server.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c20)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-22 19:48:05 UTC  ``` To ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/389/ds.git    a123b54..1980427  master -> master commit 1980427b8c78e79982c056ac270c6c3b11188830 Author: Rich Megginson <rmeggins> Date:   Wed Feb 9 14:54:29 2011 -0700     Reviewed by: nkinder, nhosoi (Thanks!)     Branch: master     Fix Description: Check the modifications after lastmod is applied, if any.     If there are still no mods to apply, just return LDAP_SUCCESS to the client     and end the modify request.  This makes it so that an empty modify is     allowed, but no further processing is done to avoid code that may not deal     with mods == NULL.     I also found a problem with the way an empty modify was handled.  OpenLDAP     does not return an explicit error code if there was a problem reading the     sequence of modify ops, so we have to resort to other checking.  This allows     an empty modify to pass through, when using either mozldap or openldap.     Platforms tested: RHEL5 x86_64, RHEL6 x86_64     Flag Day: no     Doc impact: no To ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/389/ds.git    5d4895c..a33cb58  389-ds-base-1.2.8 -> 389-ds-base-1.2.8   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c21)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-22 19:49:34 UTC  ``` Can I remove the Security tag on this bug?   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c22)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-22 21:32:16 UTC  ``` I suppose you could, since this isn't a top-level bug, but is there a particular reason why you wanted to?   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c23)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-22 21:38:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #22](show_bug.cgi?id=675320#c22)) > I suppose you could, since this isn't a top-level bug, but is there a > particular reason why you wanted to?

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=676876#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-11 16:47:02 UTC  ``` Andrew Kerr reported that a 389 replica would crash when an empty modify request is sent to it.  This can only happen if the 389 server is built with mozldap (not OpenLDAP) and the modify operation is replicated or the server set 'cn=config nsslapd-lastmod: off'.  389 on Fedora 14 and later, as well as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, use OpenLDAP, not mozldap, and are thus unaffected.  This flaw does not affect Red Hat Directory Server 8.2.  This flaw was caused by the fix for [bug #305131](show_bug.cgi?id=305131 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Server rejects an empty modify operation") which allowed empty modify operations to proceed through the code.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=676876#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-11 16:48:21 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Andrew Kerr for reporting this issue.  Statement:  Not vulnerable. This issue did not affect Red Hat Directory Server 8 packages.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=676876#c2)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-11 18:10:00 UTC  ``` Yes, the description looks good.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=676876#c3)  Rich Megginson    2011-02-22 19:49:06 UTC  ``` To ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/389/ds.git    a123b54..1980427  master -> master commit 1980427b8c78e79982c056ac270c6c3b11188830 Author: Rich Megginson <rmeggins> Date:   Wed Feb 9 14:54:29 2011 -0700     Reviewed by: nkinder, nhosoi (Thanks!)     Branch: master     Fix Description: Check the modifications after lastmod is applied, if any.     If there are still no mods to apply, just return LDAP_SUCCESS to the client     and end the modify request.  This makes it so that an empty modify is     allowed, but no further processing is done to avoid code that may not deal     with mods == NULL.     I also found a problem with the way an empty modify was handled.  OpenLDAP     does not return an explicit error code if there was a problem reading the     sequence of modify ops, so we have to resort to other checking.  This allows     an empty modify to pass through, when using either mozldap or openldap.     Platforms tested: RHEL5 x86_64, RHEL6 x86_64     Flag Day: no     Doc impact: no To ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/389/ds.git    5d4895c..a33cb58  389-ds-base-1.2.8 -> 389-ds-base-1.2.8   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=676876#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-19 09:25:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=676876#c0)) > This flaw was caused by the fix for [bug #305131](show_bug.cgi?id=305131 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - Server rejects an empty modify operation") which allowed empty modify > operations to proceed through the code.
