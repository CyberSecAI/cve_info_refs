Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0704:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how the 389 Directory Server handles empty modify requests, particularly when built with `mozldap`. The server crashes when it receives an empty modify operation under specific conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The core issue is that an empty modify request is not properly handled, leading to a crash in the server.
- This was a regression introduced by a fix for a previous issue where the server would reject empty modify requests. The fix allowed empty modify operations, but without proper handling, the server would crash.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the server is built with `mozldap` instead of `openldap`. `openldap` based servers return an LDAP error when receiving empty modify request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful exploit leads to a crash of the 389 Directory Server replica.
- This crash can cause a denial-of-service condition as the replica becomes unavailable, which could affect the application relying on the directory server.
- The bug report indicates that replicas crash within minutes to an hour under load.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is sending an empty modify request to the 389 Directory Server.
- An attacker needs to send the request from a client capable of sending empty modify requests. The openldap `ldapmodify` command can send such requests, whereas mozldap's `ldapmodify` will not.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send LDAP modify requests to the affected 389 Directory Server.
- The server must be built with `mozldap`.
- The modify operation must either be replicated or the server must have `cn=config nsslapd-lastmod: off` set.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was identified in 389 Directory Server version 1.2.7.
- The issue does not affect 389 servers built with OpenLDAP or Red Hat Directory Server 8.2.
- A patch was released that checks for modifications after the lastmod operation and returns LDAP_SUCCESS if no changes need to be applied, preventing the crash.
