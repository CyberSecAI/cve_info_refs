Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0593:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Adobe Acrobat Reader handles a specific image format within Universal 3D (U3D) compressed files.
*   Specifically, during the decompression of image data, the application uses a size provided within the file to allocate a buffer. The decompression process then writes to that buffer, trusting the provided size.
*   The root cause is that the decompression process is not correctly bounded by the actual size of the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unbounded Buffer Overflow:** The core weakness is the unbounded nature of the decompression operation, allowing it to write beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This code would execute with the privileges of the Adobe Acrobat Reader application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** A malicious U3D file (typically embedded in a PDF) is crafted to trigger the buffer overflow vulnerability during decompression.
*   **Malicious Page:** An attacker could host a web page containing the malicious U3D data, which, if accessed using the vulnerable application, would result in exploitation.
*  **User Interaction Required**: The user needs to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need to be on the local network or have any prior access to the victim's system.
*   **Ability to deliver a malicious U3D file to the target:** The attacker needs to be able to get the target to open a file containing the malicious U3D data, either via email, web download, or other methods.

**Additional details**

*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe on 2010-09-29.
*   Adobe released an update to correct this vulnerability, after coordinated public release on 2011-02-08.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by a digital vaccine.

This information provides more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the specific mechanism of the vulnerability, including the unbounded decompression of U3D image data and how this results in a buffer overflow and leading to remote code execution.
