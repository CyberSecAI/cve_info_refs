Subject: kernel: ALSA: caiaq - Fix possible string-buffer overflow

Reported by rafa@...infosecurity.com, "Use strlcpy() to assure not to
overflow the string array sizes by too long USB device name string."

<http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=eaae55dac6b64c0616046436b294e69fc5311581>

Just FYI, I'm not requesting a CVE name for this as it only affects
Native Instruments USB audio devices with very long device name which I
think is unlikely.

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=677881>

Thanks, Eugene

# USN-1146-1: Linux kernel vulnerabilities

9 June 2011

Multiple flaws fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel

## Details

Kees Cook discovered that some ethtool functions did not correctly clear

heap memory. A local attacker with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN privileges could exploit

this to read portions of kernel heap memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

([CVE-2010-4655](/security/CVE-2010-4655))

Kees Cook discovered that the IOWarrior USB device driver did not correctly

check certain size fields. A local attacker with physical access could plug

in a specially crafted USB device to crash the system or potentially gain

root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4656](/security/CVE-2010-4656))

Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly

clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could

exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of

privacy. ([CVE-2011-0463](/security/CVE-2011-0463))

Jens Kuehnel discovered that the InfiniBand driver contained a race

condition. On systems using InfiniBand, a local attacker could send

specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of

service. ([CVE-2011-0695](/security/CVE-2011-0695))

Rafael Dominguez Vega discovered that the caiaq Native Instruments USB

driver did not correctly validate string lengths. A local attacker with

physical access could plug in a specially crafted USB device to crash the

system or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-0712](/security/CVE-2011-0712))

Timo Warns discovered that LDM partition parsing routines did not correctly

calculate block counts. A local attacker with physical access could plug in

a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial

of service. ([CVE-2011-1012](/security/CVE-2011-1012))

Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not

correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk

device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges.

([CVE-2011-1017](/security/CVE-2011-1017))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle

large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system,

leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1593](/security/CVE-2011-1593))

I'm assigning this CVE-2011-0712.

With the recent research about having a smartphone impersonate various USB
devices, I think this attack is now more plausible than in previous years.

Thanks.

This only affects Native Instruments USB audio devices.  Proposed patch: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/tiwai/sound-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=eaae55dac6b64c0616046436b294e69fc5311581>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Rafael Dominguez Vega for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=677881#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-10 18:10:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0498 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=677881#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-07-19 05:27:35 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not backport the driver for Native Instruments USB audio devices. It did not affect the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it did not enable support for this driver. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html>.   ``` |  |
