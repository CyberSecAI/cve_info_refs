Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-0073:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Mozilla Firefox and other related products handle user-defined functions of an `nsTreeSelection` element.
*   Specifically, when the `invalidateSelection()` function is called, it's possible to free the `nsTreeSelection` object while the function is still operating on it. This leads to a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Dangling Pointer:** The core issue is a dangling pointer vulnerability caused by freeing memory that is still being referenced.
*   **Use-After-Free:** Subsequent operations on the freed `nsTreeRange` object lead to a use-after-free condition, which can be exploited to overwrite memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **Privilege of User:** The code execution occurs with the privileges of the user running the affected application (Firefox, SeaMonkey, Iceape, etc.).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector is a malicious web page containing specially crafted content that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The user needs to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file to initiate the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by hosting a malicious page.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The exploit complexity is considered low, making it easier for attackers to exploit.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is needed for exploitation.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `nsTreeSelection` element, specifically in the `invalidateSelection()` method.
*   The `invalidateSelection()` method interacts with `nsTreeRange` objects. If a custom-made `invalidateRange()` method is used, it can cause the destruction of the ranges within the selection including the `nsTreeRange` that the code is currently executing on.
*   The code then attempts to perform further operations on the freed memory.
*   The exploit involves overwriting the `mNext` pointer within the `nsTreeRange` structure with a controlled address, enabling the attacker to control the execution flow.

**Affected Software:**

*   Mozilla Firefox (versions 3.6.x <= 3.6.16, 3.5.x <= 3.5.17)
*   SeaMonkey
*   Iceape
*   Icedove (Thunderbird)
*   Avaya products using affected components.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 3.5.19, Firefox 3.6.17, and SeaMonkey 2.0.14, Iceape 2.0.11-5, Icedove 3.0.11-1+squeeze2, and later versions.
*   Users are advised to upgrade to these or newer versions to address this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit may rely on Java being enabled or other factors for reliable execution.
*   Some mitigation techniques like ASLR may need to be bypassed by the attacker.
*   The exploit involves heap spraying to control memory layout and overwrite pointers.
*   The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-1084 by the Zero Day Initiative.
