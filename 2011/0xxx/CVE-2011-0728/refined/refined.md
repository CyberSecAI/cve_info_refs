{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2011-0728",
    "details": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper filename sanitization in Loggerhead's revision view. Specifically, filenames are not escaped when displayed in the revision view of a file, allowing a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code within the filename itself.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they view a revision page. This can lead to the compromise of the user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application or perform actions on behalf of the user, including stealing session cookies.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker can create or modify a file in a repository with a malicious filename containing XSS payloads. When a user views the revisions of this file, the injected code will be executed in their browser.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to commit files with arbitrary names to a repository that is accessible via Loggerhead.",
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "loggerhead/templatefunctions.py",
    "loggerhead/controllers/view_ui.py"
  ],
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was fixed by implementing proper HTML escaping of filenames in the revision view. The fix was applied to the `templatefunctions.py` file. The specific fix involved changes to the `revision_link` function, and how it generates file links within the revision view to properly escape the filenames before displaying them in HTML. This ensures that any malicious code included in a filename will be displayed as text rather than executed."
