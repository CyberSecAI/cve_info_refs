### Bug Description

Loggerhead does not escape filenames when showing filenames in a revision view.

I have made an example of this available at

[https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~daveb/+junk/delete\_me\_v2/revision/2](https://bazaar.launchpad.net/~daveb/%2Bjunk/delete_me_v2/revision/2)

(note: If you focus over the input box you should an alert dialogue with the number 1 in it. )

because of the location of this bug I have deleted the repository - if you visited the https:// version and I had put alert(document.cookie) you would have seen your .launchpad.com lp cookie - which is apparently your session cookie.

Note that I tested this for the '/files' page, and the content is properly escaped. I'll make sure to keep the test case, though.

It is the '/revision' page specifically which is failing to escape the filenames.

The actual file viewer /view and /annotate, etc all also seem to do the right escaping. It is just the /revision page as far as I can work out.

on a side note - if you test it in firefox4 or chrome 10 - the unescaped content makes it into the page but you won't see an alert 1 / inputbox where the shouldn't be (for the example(s) I put here).

I think I tracked down the specific case in question. However, we certainly need more comprehensive testing to cover all the different cases that could be triggered.

I've subscribed mkanat because I know he's running a fairly important loggerhead site as well. We'll want to tell savannah too. I don't think sourceforge run loggerhead though.... I might be wrong.

Thanks for the heads up. Is this affecting the 1.18 branch? If so, it should be patched on that branch as well and trigger a 1.18.1 release (which is a very easy thing to do).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

My online webpage is at http://www.robertcollins.net/. My blog is at http://rbtcollins.wordpress.com/. I had an advogato profile when that was a thing - http://www.advogato.org/person/robertc.

I've spent a of lot of time in the past working on the Bazaar version control tool and related extensions - http://bazaar-vcs.org/ - as well as being the technical architect for this website - https://launchpad.net/.

Since then I've worked at HP Cloud Services working on the next generation of high scalability deployment tools and OpenStack, then on a Crypto CDN 'CacheCash', and now work at Cognite AS, liberating your data :)
