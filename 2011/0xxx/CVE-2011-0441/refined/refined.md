Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0441:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the `/etc/cron.d/php5` cron job manages PHP session files. It uses `find` command to locate files older than a certain age within `/var/lib/php5/` and then uses `rm` to delete them.
- The issue arises because the `find` command descends into subdirectories of `/var/lib/php5/`, and an attacker can exploit this behavior through a symlink attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Symlink Race Condition:**  The core vulnerability is a symlink race condition.
  - The cron job uses `find` to identify files for deletion.
  - If an attacker creates a directory (`/var/lib/php5/foo/`), then creates files inside that directory, and then during the `find` execution replaces the directory with a symlink to a sensitive location (e.g., `/etc`), the subsequent `rm` command will operate on the target of the symlink, thus deleting files in the linked directory.
- **Insecure Directory Permissions:** The `/var/lib/php5/` directory had world read/write permissions which allowed any user to create files and directories, thus facilitating the symlink attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  A local attacker can use this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files on the system, including critical system files, leading to a denial-of-service or potential compromise.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While the vulnerability itself doesn't directly escalate privileges, the cron job runs as `root`, which effectively elevates the attacker's ability to delete files to root level.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have a local user account on the vulnerable system.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to create files and directories within `/var/lib/php5` and be able to create symlinks.
- **Timing:** The attack relies on a race condition, meaning the attacker needs to manipulate the file system at a specific time interval while the cron job is running to replace a directory with a symlink before the `rm` command acts upon the contents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Local user account with write access to `/var/lib/php5/`
- Ability to create files, directories and symlinks.
- An understanding of how to manipulate the file system during the execution of the cron job

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content shows a detailed discussion among Debian developers about the vulnerability and the proposed fix.
- The vulnerability affects multiple Debian releases (lenny, squeeze, unstable).
- The fix involved changing the `find` command to use `-delete` option instead of piping the output to `xargs rm` to avoid the symlink race condition.
- Additionally, the fix involved changing the permissions of `/var/lib/php5` to prevent arbitrary user modification (done in unstable only).
- The developers also considered using the `-maxdepth 1` option with find, but decided to only apply the `-delete` option in stable/oldstable releases to avoid unexpected behavior changes
- The `-delete` option was chosen because it performs an `unlinkat(2)` syscall using `O_NOFOLLOW` flag, which prevents symlink dereference during the deletion process.
