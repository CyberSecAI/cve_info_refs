The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if a user visits a Web site containing a specially crafted Windows Metafile (WMF) image.\n\n\nOLE Automation Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0658\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists in Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) Automation. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\n\nMitigating Factors for OLE Automation Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0658\n* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attackerâs Web site.\n* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. This mode sets the security level for the Internet zone to High. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that have not been added to Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.\n* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.\n\n\nWorkarounds for OLE Automation Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0658\n* Restrict access to VBScript.dll\n* Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to \"High\" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones\n* Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone\n\n\nFAQ for OLE Automation Underflow Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0658\n\nWhat is the scope of the vulnerability?\nThis is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system remotely. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n\nWhat causes the vulnerability?\nThe vulnerability is caused by the way that OLE Automation parses a specially crafted WMF file.\n\nWhat is OLE Automation?\nObject Linking and Embedding (OLE) Automation is a Windows protocol that allows an application to share data with or to control another application.\n\nWhat is the Windows Metafile (WMF) image format?\nThe Windows Metafile (WMF) image format is a 16-bit metafile format that can contain both vector information and bitmap information. It is optimized for the Windows operating system.\n\nWhat might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?\nIf a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.\n\nHow could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?\nThis vulnerability requires that a user view a specially crafted WMF image file. An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then persuade a user to view the Web site. This can also include Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements, and compromised Web sites. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit such Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit a Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger request that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.\n\nWhat systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?\nWorkstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.\n\nI am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?\nYes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as Enhanced Security Configuration. Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.\n\nWhat does the update do?\nThis security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which OLE Automation parses WMF files.\n",
