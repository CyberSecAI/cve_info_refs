{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The myproxy-logon program does not verify that the myproxy-server's certificate contains the expected hostname or identity.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of proper hostname/identity verification in the server's certificate by the myproxy-logon program.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Man-in-the-middle attacks could be performed, potentially leading to the disclosure of the MyProxy password and the download of malicious certificates.",
  "Attack vectors": "DNS hijacking or similar attacks to redirect the client to a malicious server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to intercept network traffic or manipulate DNS to redirect myproxy-logon to a malicious server."
