  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-0672",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper Kernel-mode driver object management.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to log on to the system locally and then run a specially crafted application.",
