  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-0517",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies within the parsing of strings received by the client when the \"Run TCP/IP server\" option is enabled. The parsing occurs in a function used by multiple handlers (_TCPIP_WriteNumValueFP, _TCPIP_WriteDigValueFP, or _TCPIP_WriteStrValueFP) starting at offset 00446795. A stack overflow occurs when the input data is copied into a temporary buffer of about 60 bytes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Stack overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when copying input data into a fixed-size buffer."
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a crash and potentially execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted packet to the vulnerable service listening on TCP port 46823.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No authentication is needed to trigger the vulnerability."
