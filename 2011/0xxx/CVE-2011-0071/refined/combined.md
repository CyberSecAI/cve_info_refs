firefox security update (RHSA-2011-0471)

Original Release Date: June 27, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-194

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) and
[CVE-2011-0081](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0081.html) to these issues.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
accessible to the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0071](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0071.html) to this issue.

A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
"application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0070](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0070.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0069](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0069.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0067](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0067.html) to this issue.

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0066](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0066.html) and
[CVE-2011-0065](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0065.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1202.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | All | None | See mitigating factors below. | Avaya IQ | 5.x | None | See mitigating factors below. || Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0.x, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0067 CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0071 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081 CVE-2011-1202 | This rated a Low for IQ, MN, MSS, PS, SMGR because no critical system processes or applications are affected This is rated a None for CS1000 and IQ because XULRunner is not used or configured and Firefox is not installed |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

By using a semi-colon ";" character after the resource protocol, we can bypass the protections and use "\..\" in order to do directory traversal or use the colon ":" character.
It can be used for file/directory enumeration or including important javascript files in a script tag. For example for a windows box we can use:
<script src="resource:///;\..\..\..\directory\secret.js"></script>
Or
<script src="resource:///;\..\..\..\directory\secret.js::$data"></script>
Or
<script src="resource:///something.com;\..\..\..\directory::$index\_allocation\secret.js"></script>
---
Linux box might be exploitable by: resource:///something.com;\\..\\..\\..\\ (as I haven't tried it in a Linux box yet)
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. In windows, Open the following URL by using Mozilla Firefox:
resource:///;\..\..\..\
2. You can see the root directory
Actual Results:
You can see the root directory
Expected Results:
I should be limited and get "access denied" for example

I'm also not sure if we should be able to use "resource" protocol without doing
any directory traversal in a script tag as well! In this case, the javascript
files in the Mozilla Firefox directory can be loaded such as:
resource:///components/FeedConverter.js
For example:
<script src="resource:///components/FeedConverter.js"></script>

I think it is a major issue. However, if you think it's not a security bug (or it is a low risk), I will release it via by blog with some PoC. Therefore, this bug can come out to public (I have a smililar one in IE8 and I like to mix them together in a Poc ;) ).
I'm waiting for your response.

It is a security bug, currently rated [sg:high] (leak of local user files to websites). Please do not release details of this until we have had a change to fix this bug and push it out to users in a Firefox release. This bug is eligible for the security bug bounty, I think, if that's what you're asking.

Yes. I can't get any of this to reproduce under Linux.
Also, I think this bug is only reproducible on branch: on trunk we have omnijar, so the outer URI is a jar one and it inherently disallows poking outside of the jar.

Could you please give me a direct link to the source code that you are looking at.
Yes, you cannot do the same when you are calling a jar file by "jar:"(chrome). However, I would be thankful if you give me a link to the protection code of omnijar if you know about it as well.

It's a twisty maze of twistiness, but here's where it starts:
<http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/res/nsResProtocolHandler.cpp#466>
The input to that method is a resource:// URI. On branch, the result of that method is a file:// URI, which is resolved via <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/src/nsStandardURL.cpp#1720>. On trunk, it's a jar:file:// URI. From there, we presumably go through several steps to get an nsILocalFile (on branch) and thus an output stream that we can serve up. (This may involve <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/src/nsURLHelperWin.cpp#86>, which calls <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/src/nsURLHelper.cpp#181>.) What I can't figure out yet is how this vulnerability comes about; in net\_ParseFileURL, we deal with ';' ref portions just fine, and don't include them in the filepath which is used to construct the nsILocalFile.
There's an easy fix, of course, if we make nsResProtocolHandler::ResolveURI disallow this stuff. But it worries me that the ';' could sneak through (and be interpreted as part of the filepath!) given all the other parsing we do, and that may warrant a more generic fix. I'm going to have to step through this stuff when I get onto my Windows machine and see what codepaths we're hitting.

From <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt> §3.3:
The path may consist of a sequence of path segments separated by a
single slash "/" character. Within a path segment, the characters
"/", ";", "=", and "?" are reserved. Each path segment may include a
sequence of parameters, indicated by the semicolon ";" character.
The parameters are not significant to the parsing of relative
references.
So apparently ';' is legal within \*individual\* path segments; and it's explicitly named in <http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/base/public/nsIURL.idl#48> as a suffix which can appear after the directory/filename portion. I'm not sure of its intended meaning in either case, or of any real-world usage (other than as a delimiter inside a '?' string).
Regardless, I can't possibly see how it would be intentional that it be interpreted as part of a path or path segment when dealing with local files.

Thanks for the information.
Semi-colon character is used on some webservers that support CGIs/JSP/Servlet as a delimiter; and that's why I tried it.
According to: <http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.2>
"We recommend that HTTP server implementors, and in particular, CGI implementors support the use of ";" in place of "&" to save authors the trouble of escaping "&" characters in this manner."
We can also have file/folder with semi-colon in its name.
Semi-colon has caused logical issues for other applications/systems before. For example: <http://soroush.secproject.com/downloadable/iis-semicolon-report.pdf>

OK. When parsing a path, we search forward for '?' and '#'; the first such occurrence is tagged as the query / ref portion respectively. We search for ';' backwards until we hit the first '/', which occurs \*after\* normalization of the paths' '\\' components to '/'. So we're explicit about treating ';' as a param portion only in the filename segment of the URL. Coupled with the fact that ';' is legal in pathnames, this all makes sense. (I think.)
The usual sequence of events for dealing with a "resource:///../"-like URL would be for the "/../" to be coalesced out before we even get to nsResProtocolHandler::ResolveURI. This would work fine if we normalized '\\' to '/' at that point, since then we'd treat ';\\..\\..\\' as ';/../../' which would coalesce to nothing. The alternative, I think, is to manually normalize and coalesce the path in nsResProtocolHandler::ResolveURI.

I think it makes more sense to say that a resource: URI with a semicolon anywhere in it is simply invalid. We don't have to support arbitrary complexity for our own URI schemes.

I was thinking of fixing this more generically by forcing unescaping and path normalization ('\' --> '/') before we resolve the resource:// URI. But doing so would require performing OS-dependent normalization which is currently only done in net\_GetFileFromURLSpec, which would be a pain.
So I think you're right, we can fix this simply by unescaping and checking for '\' in the full path rather than the file path. There's no need to test for ';' at that point since it's harmless. I'm running that patch through try.

What is the exact STR here for branch and for trunk?
On trunk, as noted, I cannot get outside of omni.jar with the examples above.

On trunk, I don't think it's possible to repro. On branches on Windows, "resource:///;\..\..\" will do it. Mac/Linux are unaffected.

Glad that this bug has been solved. Now guys, I'm not sure about the bounty process, how can I realise if this one can get it or not?
And for my information, do you suggest the security researchers to still report the security bugs that cannot be eligble for the bug bounty as well? if yes, why do you?

This bug was nominated for a bug bounty on Jan. 20th, but you'll need to wait until the bounty committee meets (around once a month) to find out if the nomination is accepted. If it is accepted, you'll be contacted via e-mail.
> And for my information, do you suggest the security researchers to still report
> the security bugs that cannot be eligble for the bug bounty as well? if yes,
> why do you?
Sure, even if something doesn't explicitly qualify for a bug bounty (as per the policy), the committee has been known to grant bounties for clever bug findings and other special circumstances. In some cases, the researcher might not be aware that his/her lower-severity bug could be modified slightly or used with some other bug to expand privileges, which would make the issue more critical than originally considered by the researcher. By submitting bugs, you're helping to improve the security of Firefox and other Mozilla projects and doing your part to protect millions of users. Plus, almost all security issues end up in a security advisory, which would include the submitter's name, in case credit means a lot to you (i.e., more security cred for finding a Firefox vulnerability or something). There are many reasons why you should still submit your findings, but in the end, it is your choice, though we hope you will notify us rather than keep the issues to yourself.
If you have any other questions about the bug bounty program, please contact security@mozilla.org. We generally try to keep the bounty process outside of the bugs themselves so as not to interfere with development of security fixes, but we're more than happy to answer any and all questions/concerns/comments you have about how this process works.
Thanks!

> I think we can refer to these links:

The difference between this one and MFSA 2008-05 is on that one the traversal started in the profile directory which opened up juicy JS-formatted files that could be read (e.g. user's prefs, sessionrestore data). The resource: scheme starts in the install directory and profile data should be obscured by the directory name salting.
non-JS files will just give you syntax errors if you try to load them, but no stolen data. You could probably fingerprint someone by looking in common locations for what kinds of things they have installed, but that's a lower severity privacy attack.
Lowering the severity to moderate and recommending a reduced bounty, but it's possible I've completely missed some common trove of data you can capture using this technique. Here's your chance to appeal to restore the full sg:high rating.Whiteboard: [sg:high][hardblocker] → [sg:moderate?][hardblocker]

I'm trying to see if there is a way to find the profile name and include the "sessionstore.js" by using this attack. I'll write my result here which was successful or failed for the final judge.
Thanks.

|  | |

By default we add random characters to the profile name to defeat this type of attack. If you can find a way to determine the salted profile name that would be an interesting bug in its own right.
There may be standard OS files that can be read in JS format. If there are any those are more likely to be reachable in predictable locations.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-16

## Directory traversal in resource: protocol

Announced
April 28, 2011
Reporter
Soroush Dalili
Impact
Moderate
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.19
* Firefox 3.6.17
* SeaMonkey 2.0.14
* Thunderbird 3.1.10

### Description

Security researcher **Soroush Dalili** reported that
the resource: protocol could be exploited to allow directory traversal
on Windows and the potential loading of resources from non-permitted
locations. The impact would depend on whether interesting files existed
in predictable locations in a useful format. For example, the existence
or non-existence of particular images might indicate whether certain
software was installed.

                 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, an unbranded
version of the Thunderbird mail/news client.

CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

   "Scoobidiver", Ian Beer Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo,
   Mats Palmgren, Jesse Ruderman, Aki Kelin and Martin Barbella
   discovered memory corruption bugs, which may lead to the execution
   of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0073

   "regenrecht" discovered several dangling pointer vulnerabilities,
   which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0067

   Paul Stone discovered that Java applets could steal information
   from the autocompletion history.

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
