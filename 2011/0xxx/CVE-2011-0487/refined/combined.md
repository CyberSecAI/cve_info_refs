#### Vulnerability Note VU#680540

Original Release Date: 2011-01-13 | Last Revised: 2011-01-13

---

### Overview

ICQ 7 does not verify the origin of automatic updates which may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.

### Description

| According to ICQ's [website](http://www.icq.com/info/about.html): "*ICQ, the pioneer of Instant Messaging (IM), now offers the optimal integration between Instant Messaging and Social Networks with the newest ICQ version – the Social Messaging tool that can be downloaded free of charge at* *www.icq.com*." ICQ 7 checks for updates on start-up but does not verify the origin of updates through digital signatures or other means. An attacker who can successfully spoof update.icq.com using a man-in-the-middle attack, DNS poisoning, or some other means can cause the client to download a malicious software update. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By successfully spoofing the update site, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. |
| --- |

### Solution
