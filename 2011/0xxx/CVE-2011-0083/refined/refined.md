{
  "CVE-2011-0083": {
    "Description": "Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in Firefox. A web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "Root cause": "The code within nsSVGPointList::AppendElement() does not account for user defined getter methods modifying or destroying the parent object during a repaint. The function nsSVGPathSegList::ReplaceItem() does not account for deletion of the segment object list within a user defined DOMAttrModified EventListener.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Dangling pointer vulnerability due to lack of validation after user-defined callbacks.",
      "Use-after-free vulnerability caused by missing checks after object removal."
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox, application crash",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page.",
      "Opening a malicious file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create a malicious web page or file containing SVG content. User interaction required to trigger the vulnerability by visiting the malicious content."
