  "cveId": "CVE-2011-0433",
  "description": "A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way AFM font file parser, used for rendering of DVI files, in GNOME evince document viewer and other products, processed line tokens from the given input stream. A remote attacker could provide a DVI file, with embedded specially-crafted font file, and trick the local user to open it with an application using the AFM font parser, leading to that particular application crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
