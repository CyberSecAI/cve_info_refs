  "CVE-2011-0282": {
    "Metadata": {
      "source_0": "lists.opensuse.org_f373e823_20250124_210229.html",
      "source_1": "www.vmware.com_5a3c475b_20250124_210236.html",

    },
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "The KDC LDAP back end, when testing whether a principal belongs to the default realm, assumes that principal name components are null-terminated and are not null pointers. Both of these assumptions are invalid in the general case.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper null termination handling",
         "Null pointer dereference"
      ],
      "Impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC configured with an LDAP back end to crash with a null pointer dereference.",
      "Attack vector": "Network",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can send a specially crafted principal name to a KDC configured with an LDAP back end.",
       "Additional Information": "Data leakage resulting from the overrun is essentially impossible because the read operation is a comparison rather than a copy."
