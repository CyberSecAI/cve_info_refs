  "CVE-2011-0708": {
    "description": "Integer overflow in the exif_process_IFD_TAG function in exif.c in the exif extension in PHP 5.4.0beta2 on 32-bit platforms allows remote attackers to read the contents of arbitrary memory locations or cause a denial of service via a crafted offset_val value in an EXIF header in a JPEG file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0708.",
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the `exif_process_IFD_TAG` function within the PHP Exif extension when handling crafted EXIF headers, specifically the `offset_val` value, on 32-bit platforms.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation",
	  "Buffer Over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary memory disclosure due to the integer overflow. Specifically, it allows for reading contents of arbitrary memory or causes a crash due to memory access violation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attackers can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted JPEG file with a malformed EXIF header that contains an exploitable offset_val value."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to make the PHP application process a crafted image file.",
    "additional_information": [
      "The vulnerability affects the exif extension of PHP, and could potentially affect versions as far back as PHP4. The issue is related to an improper conversion occurring within php_ifd_get32s and php_ifd_get32u in exif.c when parsing Image File Directory (IFD).",
      "The CVE description specifically mentions 5.4.0beta2 but based on the reported bug this vulnerability may exist as far back as PHP4.",
	  "Exploitation is more likely on a 64bit platform if memory limit is set to unlimited."
