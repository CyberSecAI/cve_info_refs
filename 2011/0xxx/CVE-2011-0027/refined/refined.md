{
  "CVE-2011-0027": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists in the way Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) validates memory allocation when handling internal data structures.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper memory allocation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user. This could lead to complete control of the affected system, including installing programs, viewing/changing/deleting data, or creating new user accounts.",
    "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by hosting a specially crafted webpage that triggers the vulnerability in Internet Explorer when viewed by a user. This could also be achieved through compromised websites or sites hosting user-provided content.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to convince a user to visit a malicious webpage, typically by tricking them into clicking a link in a message.  The attacker does not require any authentication and the vulnerability can be exploited remotely."
