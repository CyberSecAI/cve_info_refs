| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-16 04:02:39 UTC  ``` task_show_regs used to be a debugging aid in the early bringup days of Linux on s390. /proc/<pid>/status is a world readable file, it is not a good idea to show the registers of a process. The only correct fix is to remove task_show_regs.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/261cd298a8c363d7985e3482946edb4bfedacf98>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-11 06:21:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it does not have support for the S390 architecture. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html>.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-08 02:57:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-12 18:20:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0429 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-02-16 04:02:39 UTC  ``` task_show_regs used to be a debugging aid in the early bringup days of Linux on s390. /proc/<pid>/status is a world readable file, it is not a good idea to show the registers of a process. The only correct fix is to remove task_show_regs.  Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/261cd298a8c363d7985e3482946edb4bfedacf98>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-11 06:21:59 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it does not have support for the S390 architecture. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html>.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-08 02:57:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=677850#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-12 18:20:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0429 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0429.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: CVE request - kernel: s390 task_show_regs infoleak

"task_show_regs used to be a debugging aid in the early bringup days of
Linux on s390. /proc/<pid>/status is a world readable file, it is not a
good idea to show the registers of a process. The only correct fix is to
remove task_show_regs."

This does all the way back to 2.4.x.

Thanks, Eugene
