Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0710:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the `task_show_regs` function in the Linux kernel on s390 architecture. This function was initially intended as a debugging aid during early bring-up of Linux on s390 systems.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- The `task_show_regs` function exposes the registers of a process through the `/proc/<pid>/status` file.
- `/proc/<pid>/status` is a world-readable file, meaning any user on the system can access it.
- Exposing process registers via a world-readable file creates an information leak vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker, even without elevated privileges, could read the register values of running processes on an affected system.
- This information could potentially be used for further attacks or gaining insights into system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required, as the attacker needs to read the `/proc/<pid>/status` file.
- The attacker needs no special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a user account on the affected system.
- The attacker must be able to access the file system and specifically the `/proc` filesystem.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel for the s390 architecture.
*   The `task_show_regs` function, intended for debugging, was the source of the information leak.
*   The fix is to remove the `task_show_regs` functionality to prevent the exposure of register information.
*   The vulnerability is present in Linux kernels going back to 2.4.x.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue was resolved by removing the `task_show_regs` function.
*   Red Hat addressed this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 via errata RHSA-2011:0429 and RHSA-2011:0421 respectively.
*   VMware also addressed this vulnerability as part of a broader update to their ESX and ESXi products VMSA-2011-0012.
