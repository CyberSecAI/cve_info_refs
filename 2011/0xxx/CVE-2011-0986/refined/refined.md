Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a path disclosure issue in phpMyAdmin. When the files `README`, `ChangeLog`, or `LICENSE` are removed from their original locations, the scripts designed to display these files can inadvertently reveal the full server path to those files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the server's file path due to improperly handled file access attempts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The most direct impact is the disclosure of the full server path where phpMyAdmin is installed.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** While not directly exploitable, this information disclosure can assist attackers in identifying the system’s layout and structure. This can be a precursor to more severe attacks as an attacker can discover specific software versions, configuration details, and potential weaknesses of the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Deletion/Removal:** The attack vector requires a condition where the aforementioned files are missing from their expected locations. This could result from a misconfiguration or an administrator’s actions.
- **Web Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by a web request made to phpMyAdmin that attempts to access these files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of web requests to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Access to phpMyAdmin:** The attacker needs access to the phpMyAdmin installation, likely through a web browser.
- **Specific PHP Configuration:** The attacker may need to rely on the vulnerable server having specific PHP error reporting settings (`error_reporting` set to `E_ALL` and `display_errors` set to `On`) which is not default on production systems.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is considered to be non-critical by phpMyAdmin.
- The issue is triggered by the application attempting to read files that are missing. The script then returns the full file path within the error message.
- The provided advisory details that the issue is resolved in phpMyAdmin 3.3.9.1 and 2.11.11.2. It also provides the specific git commit hashes that resolve this issue.
