  "cve": "CVE-2011-0087",
  "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that Windows kernel-mode drivers validate data supplied from user mode to kernel mode. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
  "affected_systems": [
    "Windows XP Service Pack 3",
    "Windows XP Professional x64 Edition Service Pack 2",
    "Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2",
    "Windows Server 2003 x64 Edition Service Pack 2",
    "Windows Server 2003 with SP2 for Itanium-based Systems",
    "Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista Service Pack 2",
    "Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 1 and Windows Vista x64 Edition Service Pack 2",
    "Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems and Windows Server 2008 for 32-bit Systems Service Pack 2",

  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows kernel-mode drivers do not properly validate input passed from user mode.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient user input validation in Windows kernel-mode drivers."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker must log on to the system and run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid logon credentials to the system.",
      "Ability to log on locally."
    ]
  },
    "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is related to the win32k.sys driver, which is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem. It manages window displays, screen output, and input devices. The vulnerability cannot be exploited remotely or by anonymous users.",
