Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-0028

**Description:**
The vulnerability resides in the way Microsoft WordPad parses specially crafted Word documents. This can lead to remote code execution if a user opens a malformed Word file.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of specific fields within a Word document by the WordPad text converter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper parsing of document structures
- Insufficient input validation when handling Word files

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to:
    - Install programs
    - View, change, or delete data
    - Create new accounts with full user rights
- Complete control of the affected system if the user has administrative rights.
- Users with fewer rights are less impacted, but still vulnerable to privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** Sending a malicious Word document to a user and convincing them to open it.
- **Web-based:** Hosting a malicious Word document on a website, which a user must be convinced to visit and then open.
- Compromised websites and websites that accept user-provided content could also host the malformed document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to craft a malicious Word document with a malformed structure.
- Ability to deliver the document to the target user through email or a website.
- Requires user interaction to open the document, unless the option to 'Always ask before opening this type of file' is disabled.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.
- Systems with Microsoft Word installed are less likely to be affected since Word documents will typically be opened with Microsoft Office.
- A workaround involves disabling the WordPad Word 97 text converter by restricting access to the converter file (mswrd8.wpc).
