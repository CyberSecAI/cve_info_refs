```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists in the ovutil.dll module, specifically within the stringToSeconds function. By sending overly large values through HTTP requests, a sscanf function overflows a static buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow",
    "Lack of input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of HP OpenView Network Node Manager with the privileges of the user running the webserver.",
  "Attack vectors": "A crafted HTTP request to the target host, specifically targeting the jovgraph.exe CGI program which loads ovutil.dll.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required."
