Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0900:

**CVE-2011-0900**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially crafted `.rdp` file. The provided perl script generates a malformed RDP file with an oversized "client hostname" parameter.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): The primary vulnerability is the ability to cause a DoS by exploiting a parsing issue in the RDP client.
    *   Malformed Input Handling: The RDP client fails to properly handle an overly long hostname string.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation leads to a denial of service, likely crashing the RDP client application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves delivering a malicious `.rdp` file to a user.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide or trick the user into opening the malicious `.rdp` file on the vulnerable machine.
    *   The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit code is a Perl script that creates a malformed `.rdp` file with an oversized `client hostname` parameter, designed to crash the RDP client application upon opening it.
*   The exploit targets "all versions" of the `tsclient` application, which is a Linux-based Terminal Server Client.
*   The exploit is a client-side DoS, where a user has to open the malicious file.
*   The exploit was tested on Ubuntu 10.10.
