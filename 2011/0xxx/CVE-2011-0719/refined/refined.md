  "CVE-2011-0719": {
    "description": "Volker Lendecke discovered that missing range checks in Samba's file descriptor handling could lead to memory corruption, resulting in denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Missing range checks in Samba's file descriptor handling.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service. The Samba server could crash or hang.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Remote attacker sending specially crafted requests to the server"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "Remote attacker capable of sending crafted requests to the Samba server.",
       "more_details": "The vulnerability stems from how Samba handles file descriptors, specifically when a file descriptor with a value greater than or equal to FD_SETSIZE is added to a set, it can set a single bit on the stack to a '1', this could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution although it is not believed to be easily achieved. This was due to smbd not capping the maximum allowed file descriptors below 1024."
