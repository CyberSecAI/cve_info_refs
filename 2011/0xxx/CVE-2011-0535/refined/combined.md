# Zikula CMS 1.2.4 <= Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability

---

*From*: YGN Ethical Hacker Group <lists () yehg net>

*Date*: Tue, 1 Feb 2011 16:55:55 +0800

```
====================================================
Zikula CMS 1.2.4 <= Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability
====================================================

1. OVERVIEW

The Zikula 1.2.4 and lower versions were vulnerable to Cross Site
Request Forgery (CSRF).

2. BACKGROUND

Zikula is a Web Application Toolkit, which allows you to run
impressive websites and build powerful online applications. Zikula has
received praise for many things, but we belive the highlights are ease
of use, quick and easy development, security and performance and
lastly flexibility.

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Zikula CMS 1.2.4 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a
remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw
exists because the application does not require multiple steps or
explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of
administrator functions such as adding new user, assigning user to
administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may
trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of
the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the
application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing
arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the
application, without further prompting or verification.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

1.2.4 <=

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

The following request escalates a normal user to an administrator.

[REQUEST]
POST /zikula/index.php?module=users&type=admin&func=processusers&op=edit
HTTP/1.1

authid=&userid=3&do=yes&access_permissions%5B%5D=2&access_permissions%5B%5D=1&uname=tester&email=tester%40yehg.net&pass=&vpass=&activated=1&theme=&submit=
[/REQUEST]

6. SOLUTION

Upgrade to Zikula 1.2.5 or higher

7. VENDOR

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

[February 01, 2011](http://bl0g.yehg.net/2011/02/zikula-cms-124-cross-site-request.html "permanent link")

1. OVERVIEW

The Zikula 1.2.4 and lower versions were vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

2. BACKGROUND

Zikula is a Web Application Toolkit, which allows you to run impressive websites and build powerful online applications. Zikula has received praise for many things, but we belive the highlights are ease of use, quick and easy development, security and performance and lastly flexibility.

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

Zikula CMS 1.2.4 and lower versions contain a flaw that allows a remote Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack. The flaw exists because the application does not require multiple steps or explicit confirmation for sensitive transactions for majority of administrator functions such as adding new user, assigning user to administrative privilege. By using a crafted URL, an attacker may trick the victim into visiting to his web page to take advantage of the trust relationship between the authenticated victim and the application. Such an attack could trick the victim into executing arbitrary commands in the context of their session with the application, without further prompting or verification.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

1.2.4 <=

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

The following request escalates a normal user to an administrator.

[REQUEST]
POST /zikula/index.php?module=users&type=admin&func=processusers&op=edit HTTP/1.1

authid=&userid=3&do=yes&access\_permissions%5B%5D=2&access\_permissions%5B%5D=1&uname=tester&email=tester%40yehg.net&pass=&vpass=&activated=1&theme=&submit=
[/REQUEST]

6. SOLUTION

Upgrade to Zikula 1.2.5 or higher

7. VENDOR

Zikula Foundation

8. CREDIT

This vulnerability was discovered by Aung Khant, http://yehg.net, YGN Ethical Hacker Group, Myanmar.
