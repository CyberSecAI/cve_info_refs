          "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a local file inclusion (LFI) in PhpGedView, where the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.",

          "attack_vectors": [
            "HTTP GET request",

            "additional_information": "The exploit uses a null byte (%00) to terminate the file path, preventing further path traversal checks. The exploit also lists the modules that are available in order to specify one as a parameter."
