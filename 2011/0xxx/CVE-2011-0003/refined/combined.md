# Description

Clickjacking is a type of vulnerability discovered in 2008, which is similar to CSRF.

The attack involves displaying the target webpage in a iframe embedded in a malicious website. Using CSS, the submit button of the form on the target webpage is made invisible, and then overlaid with some button or link on the malicious website that encourages the user to click on it. For more information, see:

```
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking
http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking
```

Web browsers have standardised on a defence called X-Frame-Options, which puts the onus on the web application to prevent framing of sensitive content.

Wikipedia user PleaseStand brought it to our attention that despite the passage of more than two years, MediaWiki still had no defence against clickjacking. PleaseStand pointed out that when user or site JavaScript or CSS is enabled ($wgAllowUserJs, $wgAllowUserCss, $wgUseSiteJs or $wgUseSiteCss), clickjacking is essentially equivalent to cross-site scripting (XSS), that is to say, it allows full compromise of the account of the user visiting the malicious website.

A fix will be shortly released, in MediaWiki 1.16.1. Our approach is to allow framing of basic page views and search pages, but to deny framing of special pages unless they have explicitly opted out of clickjacking protection. By taking this moderate approach, instead of denying all framing, we hope to avoid having system administrators disable the security feature by patching it out.

Security-conscious system administrators may wish to disable framing entirely using $wgBreakFrames = true. In MediaWiki 1.16.1 or later, this will provide protection against clickjacking vulnerabilities in extensions which opt out incorrectly or embed sensitive forms on pages which are opted out.

Alternatively, you can configure your web server to send an X-Frame-Options header on all pages. For example with Apache mod\_headers:

```
Header always set X-Frame-Options DENY
```

For MediaWiki 1.15.x or earlier branches, we will provide a simplified security patch which denies all framing.

Extensions which wish to allow framing on a given page should do so by calling $wgOut->allowClickjacking(). This should only be done on pages which do not contain CSRF-protected forms or links. Any extension which embeds a CSRF-protected form in an unprotected article view page should call $wgOut->preventClickjacking(), after Article::view() has called $wgOut->allowClickjacking(), to reset the flag.

To be protected against clickjacking, all users need to use a browser which supports the X-Frame-Options header. Our patch does include standard frame-breaking JavaScript code, but this is known to be insufficient for most browsers. See the OWASP article for more details. For information on supported browsers, see:

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/the_x-frame-options_response_header>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I would like to announce the release of MediaWiki 1.16.1, which is a
security and maintenance release.

Wikipedia user PleaseStand pointed out that MediaWiki has no
protection against "clickjacking". With user or site JavaScript or CSS
enabled, clickjacking can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS), and thus
full compromise of the wiki account of any user who visits a malicious
external site. Clickjacking affects all previous versions of MediaWiki.

Our fix involves denying framing on all pages except normal page views
and a few selected special pages. To be protected, all users need to
use a browser which supports X-Frame-Options. For information about
supported browsers, see:

<<https://developer.mozilla.org/en/the_x-frame-options_response_header>>

For more information about this vulnerability and the related patch, see:

<<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26561>>

Other changes in MediaWiki 1.16.1:

* (bug 24981) Allow extensions to access SpecialUpload variables again
* (bug 24724) list=allusers was out by 1 (shows total users - 1)
* (bug 24166) Fixed API error when using rvprop=tags
* For wikis using French as a content language, Special:Téléchargement
works again as an alias for Special:Upload.
* (bug 25167) Correctly load JS fixes for IE6 (fixing a regression in
1.16.0)
* (bug 25248) Fixed paraminfo errors in certain API modules.
* The installer now has improved handling for situations where
safe_mode is active or exec() and similar functions are disabled.
* (bug 19593) Specifying --server in now works for all maintenance
scripts.
* Fixed $wgLicenseTerms register globals.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: (possible) CVE request: Clickjacking in Mediawiki

Hi,

Mediawiki <= 1.16 is vulnerable to clickjacking when showing iframes in a
wiki:

<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26561>

I don't know if this warrants a CVE ID, but if so please assign one.

(please CC me on replies, TIA)

Thanks,
