    that a large packet length in a pcap-ng file could crash Wireshark.

    ([Bug
    5661](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5661))

    Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3.
    * Wireshark could overflow a buffer while reading a Nokia DCT3
      trace file.

      Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3.
      [CVE-2011-0713](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0713)* Paul Makowski working for SEI/CERT discovered that Wireshark on 32
        bit systems could crash while reading a malformed 6LoWPAN packet.

        ([Bug
        5722](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5722))

        Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.4.3.
        * joernchen of Phenoelit discovered that the LDAP and SMB dissectors
          could overflow the stack.

          ([Bug
          5717](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5717))

          Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3. (Prior versions including 1.0.x are also affected.)
          * Xiaopeng Zhang of Fortinet's Fortiguard Labs discovered that large
            LDAP Filter strings can consume excessive amounts of memory.

            ([Bug
            5732](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5732))

            Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3. (Prior versions including 1.0.x are also affected.)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.4.4 or later.
Due to the nature of these bugs we do not recommend trying to work around the
problem by disabling dissectors.

## Wireshark 6LoWPAN denial of service vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#215900

Original Release Date: 2011-03-02 | Last Revised: 2011-03-29

---

### Overview

Wireshark will crash on 32-bit systems while reading a malformed 6LoWPAN packet.

### Description

| Paul Makowski's report states:  *dissect\_6lowpan\_iphc()* *in* */epan/dissectors/packet-6lowpan.c* *trusts user supplied data when incrementing '**offset**'. It is possible for the user to increment '**offset**' to a value greater than* *tvb->length* *and/or* *tvb->reported\_length**, forcing the dissector to attempt dissection out of bounds. If '**offset**' is greater than* *tvb->length* *or* *tvb->reported\_length**, then* *tvb\_length\_remaining()* *or* *tvb\_reported\_length\_remaining()* *will return -1 respectively. If* *tvb\_length\_remaining()* *returns -1, then a buffer is allocated 1 byte too short, leading to a partial overwrite of the heap canary.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may trigger a denial of service, causing any active capture or .pcap dissection to crash Wireshark/tshark. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**Upgrade to Wireshark 1.4.4. Several other security related fixes are also included in this version. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## wnpa-sec-2011-03 · Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

## Summary

**Name:** Multiple vulnerabilities in Wireshark

**Docid:** wnpa-sec-2011-03

**Date:** March 1, 2011

**Affected versions:** 1.2.0 up to and including
1.2.14

**Fixed versions:** 1.2.15

## Details

### Description

Wireshark 1.2.15 fixes the following vulnerabilities:

* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
  that Wireshark could free an uninitialized pointer while reading a
  malformed pcap-ng file.

  ([Bug
  5652](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5652))

  Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3.
  [CVE-2011-0538](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0538)* Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered
    that a large packet length in a pcap-ng file could crash Wireshark.

    ([Bug
    5661](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5661))

    Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3.
    * Wireshark could overflow a buffer while reading a Nokia DCT3
      trace file.

      Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3.
      [CVE-2011-0713](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0713)
      * joernchen of Phenoelit discovered that the LDAP and SMB dissectors
        could overflow the stack.

        ([Bug
        5717](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5717))

        Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3. (Prior versions including 1.0.x are also affected.)
        * Xiaopeng Zhang of Fortinet's Fortiguard Labs discovered that large
          LDAP Filter strings can consume excessive amounts of memory.

          ([Bug
          5732](https://bugs.wireshark.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5732))

          Versions affected: 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.4.0 to 1.4.3. (Prior versions including 1.0.x are also affected.)

## Impact

It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a series of malformed
packets onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace
file.

## Resolution

Upgrade to Wireshark 1.2.15 or later.
Due to the nature of these bugs we do not recommend trying to work around the
problem by disabling dissectors.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Wireshark source code and installation packages are available from
<http://www.wireshark.org/download.html>.

### Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages.
You can usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management
system specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages
can be found on the
[download page](http://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty)
on the Wireshark web site.

## File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for
preference files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries.
These locations vary from platform to platform. You can use
About->Folders to find the default locations on your system.

## Known Problems

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
