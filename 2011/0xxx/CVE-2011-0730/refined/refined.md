```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a decoupling of the logic verifying XML signatures and the application logic that utilizes them.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SOAP requests lack proper validation, enabling attackers to manipulate the location of signed elements in a way that bypasses security checks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use a valid SOAP request to execute arbitrary commands on the CLC (Cloud Controller), CC (Cluster Controller) or NC (Node Controller), with the privileges of the original authenticated user.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack involves crafting a malicious SOAP request that manipulates the placement of XML elements, while still maintaining a valid signature. By changing the elements used by application logic, the attacker can bypass intended security mechanisms.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in possession of a valid SOAP request to any of the affected components (CLC, CC, or NC). No other special capabilities are explicitly mentioned but this usually implies network access to one of these components."
