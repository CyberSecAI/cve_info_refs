  "CVE-2011-0105": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel does not properly initialize a variable that is used as the length of a memcpy operation while parsing a specially crafted Excel file. This condition can be exploited to cause a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper data initialization",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the system, including the ability to install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Email: sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and convincing them to open it.",
      "Web-based attack: hosting a website containing a malicious Excel file and convincing users to visit the site and open the file."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a specially crafted Excel file. They would also need to convince a user to open the file, either through email or a website.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Excel handles the initialization of a variable used in a memcpy operation. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the variable isn't correctly initialized while processing a crafted Excel file. This CVE is part of a larger security bulletin (MS11-021) which addresses 9 different vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office."
