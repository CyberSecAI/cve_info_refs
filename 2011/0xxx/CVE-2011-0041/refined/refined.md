Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0041:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the way that GDI+ (Graphics Device Interface) handles integer calculations when processing Enhanced Metafile (EMF) image files. This improper handling of integer calculations leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow leading to memory corruption when processing specially crafted EMF files.
- The vulnerability is present in the GDI+ component, which is used by multiple Microsoft products including Windows and Office.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Complete System Control:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system.
- **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could install programs, view, change or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- **Denial of Service (Indirect):** While not explicitly mentioned as a direct impact, successful code execution could result in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web-based Attacks:** An attacker could host a website containing a specially crafted image that exploits the vulnerability, luring users to visit it via email or instant messages.
- **Compromised Websites:** Compromised websites or websites hosting user-provided content could also contain malicious content.
- **Email Attacks:** Attackers could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted emails or Office documents, enticing users to open them.
- **Network Shares:** Attackers could host malicious images on network shares, convincing users to browse to the folder in Windows Explorer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to have a login or specific access to the targeted system.
- **Crafting Malicious Files:** The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious EMF image files that trigger the integer overflow.
- **Social Engineering (Likely):** The attacker would need to convince a user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious website.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects several versions of Windows (XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008) and Microsoft Office XP Service Pack 3.
- The Microsoft Exploitability Index at the time of release rated this vulnerability as "Exploitation Detected," indicating that Microsoft was aware of in-the-wild exploitation.
- Mitigation techniques and workarounds, such as disabling metafile processing, are mentioned but have potential impacts on system functionality.
- Microsoft released a patch to correct the vulnerability.

The provided documents give a good overview of the vulnerability, and its potential impact. It also indicates the severity of the vulnerability due to the rating given by the exploitability index.
