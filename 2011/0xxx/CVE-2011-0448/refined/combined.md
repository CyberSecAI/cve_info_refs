[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-jmm9-2p29-vh2w)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-jmm9-2p29-vh2w/dependabot)

## Package

bundler

activerecord
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 3.0.0, < 3.0.4

## Patched versions

3.0.4

## Description

Ruby on Rails 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not ensure that arguments to the limit function specify integer values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks via a non-numeric argument.

This
vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0448.

Versions Affected: 3.0.0-3.0.3
Not affected: Releases before 3.0.0
Fixed Versions: 3.0.4

Impact
------
All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one
of the work arounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 3.0.4 release is available at the normal location.

Workarounds
-----------

Users should convert any values provided to the limit() function into
integers explicitly. For example code which is currently:

@posts = Post.limit(params[:per\_page]).all

Should become:

@posts = Post.limit(params[:per\_page].to\_i).all

Patches
-------
Given the simplicity of the of workarounds and the low risk of the
upgrade, we will not be backporting this change to earlier releases.

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at
present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade
as soon as possible.
