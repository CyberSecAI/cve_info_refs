  "CVE-2011-0093": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Visio parses certain structures when handling specially crafted Visio files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less affected than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Microsoft Visio does not properly handle corrupted structures when opening specially crafted Visio files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Memory corruption due to improper handling of data structures in specially crafted Visio files."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, enabling them to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted Visio file.",
           "Email Attack: An attacker could send the malicious Visio file as an email attachment, and convince the user to open it.",
         "Web-based Attack: An attacker could host a malicious Visio file on a website and convince a user to visit the website and open the file."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create a specially crafted Visio file and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable version of Microsoft Visio."
    },
    "affected_products": [
      "Microsoft Visio 2002 Service Pack 2",
      "Microsoft Visio 2003 Service Pack 3",
      "Microsoft Visio 2007 Service Pack 2"
    ],
     "workarounds": [
         "Restrict Access to ELEMENTS.DLL: Use the cacls command to deny access to the 'elements.dll' file for the 'everyone' group.",
          "Disable Add-ins in Microsoft Visio 2007: Disable all application add-ins through the Trust Center settings.",
          "Avoid Opening Untrusted Files: Do not open Visio files from untrusted or unexpected sources."

     ],
    "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is a remote code execution vulnerability. The vulnerability is addressed by correcting the way that Microsoft Visio parses corrupted structures when opening specially crafted Visio files. The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the release of the security update."
