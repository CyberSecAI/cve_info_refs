Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0717:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a session fixation flaw present in Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite and Spacewalk services.
*   The issue stems from how these services handle session cookies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Session Fixation:** The primary weakness is that the application does not properly regenerate session identifiers upon successful authentication. This allows an attacker to potentially fixate a user's session by pre-setting a session cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** If a malicious actor can pre-set a session cookie in a victim's browser to a valid value, they could hijack the victim's session after the user logs in. This means the attacker can gain unauthorized access to the victim's account and perform actions as the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a malicious party manipulating the session cookie in the victim's browser. This might involve tricking the victim into clicking a malicious link, or using other methods to control the user's browser session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Pre-set Cookies:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the session cookie in a victim's browser. This can potentially be done through various means, such as a man-in-the-middle attack, crafted links or exploiting browser vulnerabilities
*   **Knowledge of Valid Session Cookies:** While the attacker is setting a session cookie, it's not clear if the attacker also needs to know a valid session id or if a random session id will suffice to perform the session fixation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Thomas Biege of the SuSE Security Team.
*   Red Hat addressed this issue in Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.4 via RHSA-2011:0300.
*   The vulnerability also affects Spacewalk, for which tracking bugs were created.
