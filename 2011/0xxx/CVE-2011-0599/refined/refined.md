  "CVE-2011-0599": {
    "Description": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the Bitmap parsing component of rt3d.dll in Adobe Reader. When allocating a destination buffer for handling 4/8-bit RLE compressed bitmaps, the process uses the bitmap bits per pixel and number of colors values directly. A pointer is created based on the specified color depth, which can then be used to copy user supplied data into the fixed-length color data buffer on the heap.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of bitmap metadata during buffer allocation for RLE compressed bitmaps.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
       "Integer Overflow (potentially related to the use of bits per pixel and number of colors values)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution under the context of the user.",
    "Attack vector": "The vulnerability can be exploited by enticing a user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability during processing of a crafted bitmap.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "A remote attacker can exploit this by crafting a malicious file or webpage. No special privileges are required other than the ability to deliver the malicious file or page to a user."
