Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `pimd` (Protocol Independent Multicast daemon) creates temporary files in `/var/tmp` with predictable names upon receiving specific signals (USR1 and USR2).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Creation:** `pimd` creates files in `/var/tmp`, a directory that is world-writable. This allows any local user to manipulate these files.
*   **Predictable Filenames:** The filenames (`pimd.dump` and `pimd.cache`) are predictable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Destruction:** A local user can create a symbolic link in `/var/tmp` with the predictable filename, pointing to any file on the filesystem. When `pimd` receives the signal, it overwrites the target of the symlink, leading to data loss or system disruption.
*   **Denial of Service:** Overwriting critical system files could lead to system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack vector is local. A user with access to the system can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker must be a local user on the system running the vulnerable version of `pimd`.
*   **Ability to Send Signals:** The attacker needs to be able to send USR1 or USR2 signals to the `pimd` process to trigger the file creation.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in how `pimd` handles signal-triggered actions, leading to insecure file creation in a publicly writable location.
*   The fix involves changing the file creation location to `/var/lib/misc`, which is writable only by root.

**Summary of relevant information:**

The vulnerability is due to insecure file creation in `/var/tmp` which is world-writable. When `pimd` receives a USR1 or USR2 signal, it creates files (`pimd.dump` and `pimd.cache` respectively) in this directory with predictable names. An attacker can create a symlink to any file on the system with these names. This can lead to the arbitrary overwrite of that file when `pimd` attempts to create these files on the receipt of the signals.
