kernel security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0833)

Original Release Date: July 21, 2011

Last Revised: July 2, 2015

Number: ASA-2011-208

Risk Level: Medium

Advisory Version: 6.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

\* A flaw in the dccp\_rcv\_state\_process() function could allow a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service, even when the socket was already
closed. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1093](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1093.html) to this issue.

\* Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel's
Management Module Support for Message Passing Technology (MPT) based
controllers. A local, unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause a
denial of service, an information leak, or escalate their privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-1494](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1494.html) and [CVE-2011-1495](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1495.html) to these issues.

\* A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure
element
in the bnep\_sock\_ioctl() function could allow a local user to cause an
information leak or a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1079](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1079.html) to this issue.

\* Missing error checking in the way page tables were handled in the Xen
hypervisor implementation could allow a privileged guest user to cause the
host, and the guests, to lock up. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1166](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1166.html) to this issue.

\* A flaw was found in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation checked for
the upper boundary when getting a new event channel port. A privileged
guest user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate
their privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1763](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1763.html) to this issue.

\* The start\_code and end\_code values in "/proc/[pid]/stat" were not
protected. In certain scenarios, this flaw could be used to defeat Address
Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-0726](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0726.html) to this issue.

\* A missing initialization flaw in the sco\_sock\_getsockopt() function could
allow a local, unprivileged user to cause an information leak.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1078.html) to this issue.

\* A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure
element
in the do\_replace() function could allow a local user who has the
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to cause an information leak. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
name [CVE-2011-1080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1080.html) to this issue.

\* A buffer overflow flaw in the DEC Alpha OSF partition implementation in
the Linux kernel could allow a local attacker to cause an information leak
by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1163](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1163.html) to this issue.

\* Missing validations of null-terminated string data structure
elements in
the do\_replace(), compat\_do\_replace(), do\_ipt\_get\_ctl(),
do\_ip6t\_get\_ctl(),
and do\_arpt\_get\_ctl() functions could allow a local user who has the
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to cause an information leak. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the
names [CVE-2011-1170](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1170.html), [CVE-2011-1171](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1171.html) and [CVE-2011-1172](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1172.html) to these issues.

\* A heap overflow flaw in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT)
implementation could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service
by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-1577](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1577.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0726 CVE-2011-1078 CVE-2011-1079 CVE-2011-1080 CVE-2011-1163 CVE-2011-1170 CVE-2011-1171 CVE-2011-1172 CVE-2011-1577 | The risk is Low for all products except Utility Services as exploitation of this vulnerability would require local user access, and exploitation could only result in an information leak. The risk is None for Utility Services as a local user with permissions to exploit these vulnerabilities is not supported. |
| CVE-2011-1093 | The risk is None for all products as DCCP is not used. |
| CVE-2011-1166 | The risk is Low for System Platform because it is a Host OS, but would require a privileged user to exploit. The risk is None for all products except except System Platform because they are either running as a guest OS, or do not make use of Xen. |
| CVE-2011-1494 CVE-2011-1495 | The risk is Medium for AS5300, IP Office Application Server, IQ, Presence Services, Session Manager, System Manager, System Platform, and Voice Portal because of the potential for escalation of privileges. The risk is Low for Aplication Enablement Services, Communication Manager, CS1000, and Conferencing because there are no MPT controllers that would allow this exploit. The risk is None for Utility Services as a local user with permissions to exploit these vulnerabilities is not supported. |
| CVE-2011-1763 | The risk is Medium for System Platform because it is a Host OS, and this vulnerability could result in a privilege escalation. The risk is None for all other products because they are either running as a guest OS, or do not make use of Xen. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the
event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that
customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their
Enterprise Linux.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-13 15:15:18 UTC  ``` While mm->start_stack was protected from cross-uid viewing (commit f83ce3e6b02d5e48b3a43b001390e2b58820389d), the start_code and end_code values were not. This would allow the text location of a PIE binary to leak, defeating ASLR.  Note that the value "1" is used instead of "0" for a protected value since "ps", "killall", and likely other readers of /proc/pid/stat, take start_code of "0" to mean a kernel thread and will misbehave. Thanks to Brad Spengler for pointing this out.  <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/11/380>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-13 15:23:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates. Future kernel updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c4)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-15 03:18:29 UTC  ``` added to -mm tree: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg82726.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c5)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-04-11 03:55:27 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/linus/5883f57ca0008ffc93e09cbb9847a1928e50c6f3>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-10 17:20:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    MRG for RHEL-5  Via RHSA-2011:0500 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0500.html>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-10 18:11:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0498 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0498.html>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-31 14:06:34 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0833 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0833.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=688021#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-16 03:35:31 UTC  ``` The kernel automatically evaluates partition tables of storage devices.  The code for evaluating OSF partitions (in fs/partitions/osf.c) contains a bug that leaks data from kernel heap memory to userspace for certain corrupted OSF partitions.  In more detail (from Kernel 2.6.37 fs/partition/osf.c):  (66)    for (i = 0 ; i < le16_to_cpu(label->d_npartitions); i++, partition++) {  iterates from 0 to d_npartitions - 1, where      d_npartitions is read from the partition table without validation and     partition is a pointer to an array of at most 8 d_partitions.  (70)        put_partition(state, slot, (71)          le32_to_cpu(partition->p_offset), (72)          le32_to_cpu(partition->p_size));  adds a partition based on data referenced by partition.  As partition may point beyond the partition table data structure, p_offset and p_size are read from kernel heap beyond the partition table.  In some cases, put_partition logs error messages to userspace including the p_offset and p_size values.  Hence, some values from kernel heap are leaked to userspace.  So validate the value of d_npartitions.  Reference: <http://www.spinics.net/lists/mm-commits/msg82737.html>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Timo Warns for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=688021#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-16 03:39:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0833.html>, <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0542.html>, and <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0500.html>.

The patch titled
     proc: protect mm start_code/end_code in /proc/pid/stat
has been added to the -mm tree.  Its filename is
     proc-protect-mm-start_code-end_code-in-proc-pid-stat.patch

Before you just go and hit "reply", please:
   a) Consider who else should be cc'ed
   b) Prefer to cc a suitable mailing list as well
   c) Ideally: find the original patch on the mailing list and do a
      reply-to-all to that, adding suitable additional cc's

*** Remember to use Documentation/SubmitChecklist when testing your code ***

See <http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/stuff/added-to-mm.txt> to find
out what to do about this

The current -mm tree may be found at <http://userweb.kernel.org/~akpm/mmotm/>

Subject: proc: protect mm start_code/end_code in /proc/pid/stat
From: Kees Cook <kees.cook@xxxxxxxxxxxxx>

While mm->start_stack was protected from cross-uid viewing (commit
f83ce3e6b02d5 ("proc: avoid information leaks to non-privileged
processes")), the start_code and end_code values were not.  This would
allow the text location of a PIE binary to leak, defeating ASLR.

Note that the value "1" is used instead of "0" for a protected value since
"ps", "killall", and likely other readers of /proc/pid/stat, take
start_code of "0" to mean a kernel thread and will misbehave.  Thanks to
Brad Spengler for pointing this out.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-13 15:15:18 UTC  ``` While mm->start_stack was protected from cross-uid viewing (commit f83ce3e6b02d5e48b3a43b001390e2b58820389d), the start_code and end_code values were not. This would allow the text location of a PIE binary to leak, defeating ASLR.  Note that the value "1" is used instead of "0" for a protected value since "ps", "killall", and likely other readers of /proc/pid/stat, take start_code of "0" to mean a kernel thread and will misbehave. Thanks to Brad Spengler for pointing this out.  <https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/3/11/380>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Kees Cook for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=684569#c3)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-03-13 15:23:09 UTC  ``` Statement:  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/>, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0833)

## Topic

Updated kernel packages that fix multiple security issues and several bugs
are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

This update fixes the following security issues:

* A flaw in the dccp\_rcv\_state\_process() function could allow a remote

attacker to cause a denial of service, even when the socket was already
closed. (CVE-2011-1093, Important)

* Multiple buffer overflow flaws were found in the Linux kernel's

Management Module Support for Message Passing Technology (MPT) based
controllers. A local, unprivileged user could use these flaws to cause a
denial of service, an information leak, or escalate their privileges.
(CVE-2011-1494, CVE-2011-1495, Important)

* A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure element

in the bnep\_sock\_ioctl() function could allow a local user to cause an
information leak or a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1079, Moderate)

* Missing error checking in the way page tables were handled in the Xen

hypervisor implementation could allow a privileged guest user to cause the
host, and the guests, to lock up. (CVE-2011-1166, Moderate)

* A flaw was found in the way the Xen hypervisor implementation checked for

the upper boundary when getting a new event channel port. A privileged
guest user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or escalate
their privileges. (CVE-2011-1763, Moderate)

* The start\_code and end\_code values in "/proc/[pid]/stat" were not

protected. In certain scenarios, this flaw could be used to defeat Address
Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). (CVE-2011-0726, Low)

* A missing initialization flaw in the sco\_sock\_getsockopt() function could

allow a local, unprivileged user to cause an information leak.
(CVE-2011-1078, Low)

* A missing validation of a null-terminated string data structure element

in the do\_replace() function could allow a local user who has the
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1080, Low)

* A buffer overflow flaw in the DEC Alpha OSF partition implementation in

the Linux kernel could allow a local attacker to cause an information leak
by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.
(CVE-2011-1163, Low)

* Missing validations of null-terminated string data structure elements in

the do\_replace(), compat\_do\_replace(), do\_ipt\_get\_ctl(), do\_ip6t\_get\_ctl(),
and do\_arpt\_get\_ctl() functions could allow a local user who has the
CAP\_NET\_ADMIN capability to cause an information leak. (CVE-2011-1170,
CVE-2011-1171, CVE-2011-1172, Low)

* A heap overflow flaw in the Linux kernel's EFI GUID Partition Table (GPT)

implementation could allow a local attacker to cause a denial of service
by mounting a disk that contains specially-crafted partition tables.
(CVE-2011-1577, Low)

Red Hat would like to thank Dan Rosenberg for reporting CVE-2011-1494 and
CVE-2011-1495; Vasiliy Kulikov for reporting CVE-2011-1079, CVE-2011-1078,
CVE-2011-1080, CVE-2011-1170, CVE-2011-1171, and CVE-2011-1172; Kees Cook
for reporting CVE-2011-0726; and Timo Warns for reporting CVE-2011-1163
and CVE-2011-1577.

This update also fixes several bugs. Documentation for these bug fixes will
be available shortly from the Technical Notes document linked to in the
References section.

Users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported
patches to correct these issues, and fix the bugs noted in the Technical
Notes. The system must be rebooted for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

To install kernel packages manually, use "rpm -ivh [package]". Do not
use "rpm -Uvh" as that will remove the running kernel binaries from
your system. You may use "rpm -e" to remove old kernels after
determining that the new kernel functions properly on your system.
