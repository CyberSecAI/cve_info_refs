    *  **Root Cause:** A crash while printing a PDF due to a PDF event handler issue.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Error handling or memory management issue within the PDF rendering and event handler code.
    *  **Impact:** Application crash or potentially code execution if exploited further.
    *  **Attack Vector:** A malicious PDF with a specially crafted event handler.
    * **Required Capabilities/Position:**  Malicious actor providing a specially crafted PDF

6.  **[65669] Low Handle merging of autofill profiles more gracefully.**
    *   **Root Cause:** Issue in handling the merging of autofill profiles.
    *  **Weaknesses:** Incorrect logic in merging user autofill data.
    *   **Impact:** Possible data inconsistency or unintended data changes, possibly minor information disclosure.
    *  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted data meant to influence the autofill merging process.
     * **Required Capabilities/Position:** Malicious actor controlling autofill data.

7.  **[Mac only] [66931] Low Work around a crash in the Mac OS 10.5 SSL libraries.**
    *   **Root Cause:** Workaround for a known crash in Mac OS 10.5 SSL libraries.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  An OS level flaw that causes instability within the browser's TLS code.
