Subject: krb5-admin-server: kadmind dies after nmap -sV
Date: Fri, 08 Apr 2011 11:27:15 +0200
```
[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=621726;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: krb5-admin-server
Version: 1.8.3+dfsg-4
Severity: important

After executing a command like this:

# nmap -n -sV krb01

where krb01 is the main kerberos server (krb5kdc and kadmind running), kadmind dies silently.

I suppose nmap sends some string when trying to guess the version of the program running, and
kadmind can't parse it.

Someone could use such a tool, or inject the malformed string directly, causing a DoS.

Attached is an strace output of the kadmind process while runing nmap against the server.

Thanks for the report and sorry about the embarrassment.

Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Hash: SHA1
MITKRB5-SA-2011-004
MIT krb5 Security Advisory 2011-004
Original release: 2011-04-12
Last update: 2011-04-12
Topic: kadmind invalid pointer free()
CVE-2011-0285
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:POC/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 10
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: Complete
Integrity Impact: Complete
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 7.8
Exploitability: Proof-of-Concept
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
SUMMARY
=======
The password-changing capability of the MIT krb5 administration daemon
(kadmind) has a bug that can cause it to attempt to free() an invalid
pointer under certain error conditions. This can cause the daemon to
crash or induce the execution of arbitrary code (which is believed to
be difficult). No exploit that executes arbitrary code is known to
exist, but it is easy to trigger a denial of service manually.
IMPACT
======
An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause the kadmind to terminate,
resulting in a denial of service. The attacker might be able to
remotely execute code on the host running kadmind, but exploiting the
freeing of an invalid pointer to execute arbitrary code is believed to
be difficult.
Some platforms detect attempted freeing of invalid pointers and
protectively terminate the process, preventing arbitrary code
execution on those platforms.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
\* kadmind in MIT releases krb5-1.7 and later is vulnerable. Earlier
releases do not contain the functionality that the vulnerable code
implements.
FIXES
=====
\* Workaround: restart the kadmind when it crashes, possibly using an
automated monitoring process.
\* Upcoming releases in the krb5-1.7.x, krb5-1.8.x, and krb5-1.9.x
series will contain fixes.
\* For the krb5-1.9 release, apply the following patch:

DETAILS
=======
The dispatch() function in kadmin/server/schpw.c (which handles the
password changing protocol) allocates an uninitialized krb5\_data
structure for the response packet, expecting process\_chpw\_request() to
fill it in. There is remotely-inducible error one path through
process\_chpw\_request() that can return to dispatch() without
initializing the data pointer in the krb5\_data structure that is to
hold the response packet, which will cause process\_tcp\_connection() in
lib/app-utils/net-server.c to free() an invalid pointer (via
kill\_tcp\_or\_rpc\_connection()). Password change requests that arrive
via UDP will not cause kadmind to free() an invalid pointer.
Releases krb5-1.7 and krb5-1.8 put some of the above-mentioned
functions in different source files, but the execution flow is largely
identical. Releases prior to krb5-1.7 did not have the TCP kpasswd
capability, and are not vulnerable.
