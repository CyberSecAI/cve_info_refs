This could be possibly exploited by local unprivileged user to crash the host (DoS).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=678169#c1)  Petr Matousek    2011-02-16 23:50:44 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/davem/net-2.6.git;a=commitdiff;h=6b0d6a9b4296fa16a28d10d416db7a770fc03287>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=678169#c2)  Petr Matousek    2011-02-16 23:51:30 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for the bridge snooping functionality. A future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=678169#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-08 02:57:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0421 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0421.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

bridge: Fix mglist corruption that leads to memory corruption

```
The list mp->mglist is used to indicate whether a multicast group
is active on the bridge interface itself as opposed to one of the
constituent interfaces in the bridge.

Unfortunately the operation that adds the mp->mglist node to the
list neglected to check whether it has already been added.  This
leads to list corruption in the form of nodes pointing to itself.

Normally this would be quite obvious as it would cause an infinite
loop when walking the list.  However, as this list is never actually
walked (which means that we don't really need it, I'll get rid of
it in a subsequent patch), this instead is hidden until we perform
a delete operation on the affected nodes.

As the same node may now be pointed to by more than one node, the
delete operations can then cause modification of freed memory.

This was observed in practice to cause corruption in 512-byte slabs,
most commonly leading to crashes in jbd2.

Thanks to Josef Bacik for pointing me in the right direction.
