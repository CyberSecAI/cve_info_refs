{
  "CVE-2011-0094": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists because Internet Explorer attempts to access an object that has not been initialized or has been deleted, which can corrupt memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper object handling."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. With administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages.",
      "Compromised websites hosting malicious content.",
        "ActiveX controls marked 'safe for initialization' embedded in applications or Microsoft Office documents hosting the IE rendering engine."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to host a website or inject malicious content into a website, and convince users to visit it."
    ],
        "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is mitigated by default in Internet Explorer running on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 because of Enhanced Security Configuration. It is not present in IE8/IE9"
  },
    "CVE-2011-0346": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability occurs when Internet Explorer attempts to access incorrectly initialized memory, leading to memory corruption.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to improper memory handling."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain the same user rights as the logged-on user.

    "Attack vectors": [
     "Specially crafted web pages.",
     "Compromised websites hosting malicious content.",
     "Banner advertisements or other methods to deliver web content."

   "CVE-2011-1244": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer incorrectly allowing attackers to access and read content from different domains during certain processes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure via incorrect cross-domain content access.",
      "Clickjacking due to manipulated frame content."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure or clickjacking, where a user's actions on a crafted page could perform unwanted or malicious actions. Attackers may be able to read content from other domains.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages disguised as legitimate content.",
        "Compromised websites or those hosting malicious advertisements"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to host a website or inject malicious content into a website, and convince users to visit it."
    ],
      "Additional Information": "This vulnerability does not have any workarounds and is not present in IE9"
    },
  "CVE-2011-1245": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists when Internet Explorer incorrectly allows scripts to access and read content from different domains or Internet Explorer zones.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure due to improper cross-domain scripting."
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to an attacker viewing content from a different domain or Internet Explorer zone.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted web pages designed to exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Compromised websites hosting malicious content."
