  "CVE-2011-0077": {
    "Description": "An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for the \"rows\" and \"cols\" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when calculating the size of the frame set leading to heap overflow when memory is allocated to store frame border colors.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap Overflow",
          "Lack of Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted HTML page with a frame set with large number of rows and cols.",
        "Browser or email client opening the crafted HTML page."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create an HTML document and have the victim open it.",
      "Affected Software": [
          "Mozilla Firefox",
        "Mozilla Thunderbird",
        "Mozilla SeaMonkey",
          "Debian Iceweasel",
        "Debian Icedove",
        "Debian Iceape",
        "Red Hat Enterprise Linux",
        "Avaya Communication Server",
          "Avaya IQ",
          "Avaya Messaging Storage Server",
          "Avaya Aura Presence Services",
          "Avaya Aura Session Manager",
          "Avaya Aura System Manager"
      ],
     "More Info": "The vulnerability arises due to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the frame set. Specifically, the product of `mNumRows` and `mNumCols` is computed as a 32-bit integer and used to allocate memory for `mChildBorderColors`. If this result overflows, a smaller-than-required memory region is allocated, leading to a heap overflow when the constructor is called for the intended number of array elements."

    "CVE-2011-0078": {
        "Description": "An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "Lack of NULL check after an out of memory error causing a write to an invalid memory location.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Improper Error Handling",
          "Arbitrary Memory Write",
              "Lack of NULL check."
      ],
        "Impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Crafted HTML page to exhaust available memory",
              "Browser or email client opening the crafted HTML page"
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to create an HTML document to exhaust memory and have the victim open it.",
          "Affected Software": [
              "Mozilla Firefox",
            "Mozilla Thunderbird",
            "Mozilla SeaMonkey",

              "Avaya Aura Session Manager",
              "Avaya Aura System Manager"
          ],
     "More Info": "The vulnerability is triggered by memory allocation failure in `nsMIMEHeaderParamImpl::GetParameterInternal`. When the call to `nsMemory::Clone` fails, resulting in a NULL pointer, a subsequent null byte is written to a calculated address offset from that invalid NULL pointer. If attackers can cause such failure reliably, and the target location is within a mapped memory region, they could overwrite data to gain control of program flow."
