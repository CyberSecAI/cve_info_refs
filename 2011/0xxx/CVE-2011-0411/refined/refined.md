  "cve_id": "CVE-2011-0411",
  "notes": "This vulnerability is triggered during the switch from plaintext to TLS, when the application's I/O buffer isn't flushed, allowing an attacker to inject commands intended for the TLS session during the plaintext phase.  Also, this vulnerability affects multiple protocols, including SMTP, POP3, etc. This vulnerability is not present in Postfix 2.8 and 2.9."
