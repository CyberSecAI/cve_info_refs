How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : postfix
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2009-2939 CVE-2011-0411 CVE-2011-1720

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Postfix, a mail transfer
agent.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:

CVE-2009-2939
        The postinst script grants the postfix user write access to
        /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to
        conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.

CVE-2011-0411
        The STARTTLS implementation does not properly restrict I/O
        buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
        commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
        command that is processed after TLS is in place.

CVE-2011-1720
        A heap-based read-only buffer overflow allows malicious
        clients to crash the smtpd server process using a crafted SASL
        authentication request.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.5-1.1+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your postfix packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=674814#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-02-03 13:03:59 UTC  ``` It was found, that Postfix, a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), recognized SMTP commands during plaintex to TLS session switch (by TLS protocol initialization). A remote attacker could use this flaw to insert plaintext SMTP protocol commands into TLS protocol initialization messages, leading to SMTP commands execution during the ciphertext protocol phase, allowing the attacker to steal user credentials and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

# RHSA-2011:0423 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: postfix security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2011%3A0423)

## Topic

Updated postfix packages that fix one security issue are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score,
which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

## Description

Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), supporting LDAP, SMTP AUTH (SASL),
and TLS.

It was discovered that Postfix did not flush the received SMTP commands
buffer after switching to TLS encryption for an SMTP session. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to inject SMTP commands into
a victim's session during the plain text phase. This would lead to those
commands being processed by Postfix after TLS encryption is enabled,
possibly allowing the attacker to steal the victim's mail or authentication
credentials. (CVE-2011-0411)

Red Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2011-0411. The
CERT/CC acknowledges Wietse Venema as the original reporter.

Users of Postfix are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain a backported patch to resolve this issue. After installing this
update, the postfix service will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

## Topic

Updated postfix packages that fix two security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), supporting LDAP, SMTP AUTH (SASL),
and TLS.

It was discovered that Postfix did not flush the received SMTP commands
buffer after switching to TLS encryption for an SMTP session. A
man-in-the-middle attacker could use this flaw to inject SMTP commands into
a victim's session during the plain text phase. This would lead to those
commands being processed by Postfix after TLS encryption is enabled,
possibly allowing the attacker to steal the victim's mail or authentication
credentials. (CVE-2011-0411)

It was discovered that Postfix did not properly check the permissions of
users' mailbox files. A local attacker able to create files in the mail
spool directory could use this flaw to create mailbox files for other local
users, and be able to read mail delivered to those users. (CVE-2008-2937)

Red Hat would like to thank the CERT/CC for reporting CVE-2011-0411, and
Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for reporting CVE-2008-2937.
The CERT/CC acknowledges Wietse Venema as the original reporter of
CVE-2011-0411.

Users of Postfix are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues. After installing this
update, the postfix service will be restarted automatically.

## STARTTLS plaintext command injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#555316

Original Release Date: 2011-03-07 | Last Revised: 2011-09-08

---

### Overview

Some STARTTLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to inject commands during the plaintext phase of the protocol.

### Description

| STARTTLS is an extension to plaintext communication protocols that offers a way to upgrade a plaintext connection to an encrypted (TLS or SSL) connection instead of using a separate port for encrypted communication. Some implementations of STARTTLS contain a vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject commands during the plaintext protocol phase, that will be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase. This vulnerability is caused by the switch from plaintext to TLS being implemented below the application's I/O buffering layer.  This issue is only of practical concern for affected implementations that also perform correct certificate validation. Implementations which do not perform certificate validation are already inherently vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.Note: Not all implementations of STARTTLS are affected by this vulnerability. Some implementations of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) could also be affected by this vulnerability. Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle may be able to inject commands for the corresponding protocol (e.g., SMTP, POP3, etc.) during the plaintext protocol phase, that will then be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information and patches. |
| --- |

| **Purge the application I/O buffer**Developers of STARTTLS-enabled applications should take care to purge the application's I/O buffer immediately after switching to TLS in order to mitigate this vulnerability. |

## STARTTLS plaintext command injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#555316

Original Release Date: 2011-03-07 | Last Revised: 2011-09-08

---

### Overview

Some STARTTLS implementations could allow a remote attacker to inject commands during the plaintext phase of the protocol.

### Description

| STARTTLS is an extension to plaintext communication protocols that offers a way to upgrade a plaintext connection to an encrypted (TLS or SSL) connection instead of using a separate port for encrypted communication. Some implementations of STARTTLS contain a vulnerability that could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject commands during the plaintext protocol phase, that will be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase. This vulnerability is caused by the switch from plaintext to TLS being implemented below the application's I/O buffering layer.  This issue is only of practical concern for affected implementations that also perform correct certificate validation. Implementations which do not perform certificate validation are already inherently vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.Note: Not all implementations of STARTTLS are affected by this vulnerability. Some implementations of Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) could also be affected by this vulnerability. Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information. |
| --- |

### Impact

| A remote attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle may be able to inject commands for the corresponding protocol (e.g., SMTP, POP3, etc.) during the plaintext protocol phase, that will then be executed during the ciphertext protocol phase. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Update**Please see the Vendor Information below for specific vendor information and patches. |
| --- |

| **Purge the application I/O buffer**Developers of STARTTLS-enabled applications should take care to purge the application's I/O buffer immediately after switching to TLS in order to mitigate this vulnerability. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=674814#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-02-03 13:03:59 UTC  ``` It was found, that Postfix, a Mail Transport Agent (MTA), recognized SMTP commands during plaintex to TLS session switch (by TLS protocol initialization). A remote attacker could use this flaw to insert plaintext SMTP protocol commands into TLS protocol initialization messages, leading to SMTP commands execution during the ciphertext protocol phase, allowing the attacker to steal user credentials and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

#### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security fixes can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is available [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2011verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same **CVE#** in all risk matrices. *Italics* indicate vulnerabilities in code included from other product areas.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security fixes announced in this CPU, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts/) to determine appropriate actions.

### Product Dependencies

Oracle products may have dependencies on other Oracle products. Hence security vulnerability fixes announced in this Critical Patch Update may affect one or more dependent Oracle products. For details regarding these dependencies and to apply patches to dependent products, please refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1).

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Critical Patch Update patches are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). We recommend that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that Critical Patch Update patches are available for your releases.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities.

Supported Database, Fusion Middleware, EM Grid Control and Collaboration Suite products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

### Products in Extended Support

Critical Patch Update patches are available to customers who have purchased Extended Support under the [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Customers must have a valid Extended Support service contract to download Critical Patch Update patches for products in the Extended Support Phase.

### *On Request* Model

Oracle proactively creates patches only for platform/version combinations that, based on historical data, customers are likely to download for the next Critical Patch Update. Patches for historically inactive platform/version combinations of the Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server and Enterprise Manager will be created only if requested by customers.

Refer to Patch Set Update and Critical Patch Update April 2011 Availability Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1291877.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1291877.1) for further details regarding the On Request patches.

Subject: STARTTLS vulnerabilities

Hi,

I wanted to share some research that we did on the security of
STARTTLS. While we didn't specifically look at open source software,
many of the vulnerabilities found are in open source mail servers and
clients:

<https://nostarttls.secvuln.info/>

Our starting point was an old vulnerability in Postfix [1]. In
2011 Postfix developer Wietse Venema found that it's possible to inject
plaintext content into the TCP packet of a STARTTLS command and a
server would interpret it as if it was part of the TLS session.

This command injection vulnerability was subsequently found in many
other mail servers, but as we learned it was still not fixed
everywhere. It is most severe in IMAP and SMTP/Submission servers,
where it can be used for credential stealing.

We subsequently also found that a very similar (but somewhat less
severe) vulnerability exists in mail clients that also would interpret
plaintext injected into the answer to a STARTTLS command as if they
were part of the TLS connection. We call this a response injection.

Furthermore we learned that the IMAP PREAUTH feature is problematic in
combination with STARTTLS. PREAUTH can be sent by a server in response
to a client connection to signal the client that it is already
authenticated without login credentials. However the standards say that
in an authenticated state a client cannot send a STARTTLS command. Thus
PREAUTH allows a MitM attacker to prevent STARTTLS from happening. This
was originaly found in the Trojita mail client, but we found many other
mail clients are vulnerable.

Noteworthy open source projects that were impacted by at least one of
the vulnerabilities we found include Mozilla Thunderbird, Claws-Mail,
Mutt, LibEtPan (mail protocol library used by many other clients),
Exim, Dovecot, s/qmail, Courier. Our webpage lists all the
STARTTLS vulnerabilities we found and as far as we know them the state
of fixes and CVEs.

Our focus was the communication between mail clients and servers. We
came to the conclusion that in this situation the dedicated / implicit
TLS ports (465, 993, 995) for mail protocols should be preferred as
they avoid all STARTTLS vulnerabilities and have no real downside
(it's even faster because you avoid roundtrips). Ideally STARTTLS
should be deprecated in the long term.

Communication from server to server (esp. in combionation with
MTA-STS) and STARTTLS in other protocols would be good avenues for
further research.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
