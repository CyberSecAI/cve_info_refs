## Security releases issued

Posted by **James Bennett** on Feb. 8, 2011

Today the Django team is issuing multiple releases -- Django 1.2.5 and
Django 1.1.4 -- to remedy three security issues reported to us. All
users of affected versions of Django are urged to upgrade
immediately.

### Flaw in CSRF handling

Django includes a CSRF-protection mechanism, which makes use of a
token inserted into outgoing forms. Middleware then checks for the
token's presence on form submission, and validates it.

Previously, however, our CSRF protection made an exception for AJAX
requests, on the following basis:

1. Many AJAX toolkits add an `X-Requested-With` header when using `XMLHttpRequest`.
2. Browsers have strict same-origin policies regarding `XMLHttpRequest`.
3. In the context of a browser, the only way that a custom header of this nature can be added is with `XMLHttpRequest`.

Therefore, for ease of use, we did not apply CSRF checks to requests
that appeared to be AJAX on the basis of the `X-Requested-With`
header. The Ruby on Rails web framework had a similar exemption.

Recently, engineers at Google made members of the Ruby on Rails
development team aware of a combination of browser plugins and
redirects which can allow an attacker to provide custom HTTP headers
on a request to any website. This can allow a forged request to appear
to be an AJAX request, thereby defeating CSRF protection which trusts
the same-origin nature of AJAX requests.

Michael Koziarski of the Rails team brought this to our attention, and
we were able to produce a proof-of-concept demonstrating the same
vulnerability in Django's CSRF handling.

To remedy this, Django will now apply full CSRF validation to all
requests, regardless of apparent AJAX origin. This is technically
backwards-incompatible, but the security risks have been judged to
outweigh the compatibility concerns in this case.

Additionally, Django will now accept the CSRF token in the custom HTTP
header `X-CSRFTOKEN`, as well as in the form submission itself, for
ease of use with popular JavaScript toolkits which allow insertion of
custom headers into all AJAX requests.

The following example using the jQuery JavaScript toolkit demonstrates
this; the call to jQuery's `ajaxSetup` will cause all AJAX requests
to send back the CSRF token in the custom `X-CSRFTOKEN` header:

> ```
>
> $.ajaxSetup({
>         beforeSend: function(xhr, settings) {
>             if (!(/^http:.*/.test(settings.url) || /^https:.*/.test(settings.url))) {
>                 // Only send the token to relative URLs i.e. locally.
>                 xhr.setRequestHeader("X-CSRFToken",
>                                      $("#csrfmiddlewaretoken").val());
>             }
>         }
>     });
>
> ```

For reference, the Ruby on Rails team's announcement regarding this issue may be viewed [here](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/2/8/csrf-protection-bypass-in-ruby-on-rails).

### Potential XSS in file field rendering

Django's form system includes form fields and widgets for
performing file uploads; in rendering these fields, the name of the
file currently stored in the field is displayed. In the process of
rendering, the filename is displayed without being escaped, as reported by Trac user "e.generalov".

In many cases this does not result in a cross-site-scripting
vulnerability, as file-storage backends can and are encouraged to (and
the default backends provided with Django do) sanitize the supplied
filename according to their requirements. However, the risk of a
vulnerability appearing in a backend which does not sanitize, or which
performs insufficient sanitization, is such that Django will now
automatically escape filenames in form rendering.

### Directory-traversal vulnerability on Windows

Django's file-based session-storage backend stores session data in a
file named with the session key. This backend validates that the key
submitted in the session cookie does not contain the filesystem path
separator character, as specified by Python's `os.path.sep`, and if
that character is found in the key an exception is raised.

As mentioned in a report to the Django team by Paul McMillan, however,
this is insufficient on Windows, as filesystem operations on Windows
accept multiple potential path separators (`os.path.sep` for Windows
is the backslash character; the forward slash character is also
accepted). Due to other verification mechanisms -- sessions are also
stored with a hash of their contents, and the hash is verified on
session deserialization -- this does not automatically allow arbitrary
loading or execution of files. However, due to the possibility of
session replays, or more serious vulnerabilities if an attacker
manages to defeat the session verification, the file-based session
backend will now use an explicit whitelist of characters which may
appear in session keys. This whitelist excludes all valid path
separators.

### Affected versions

All three of the issues described above are present in the following
currently-supported Django versions:

* Django development trunk
* Django 1.2
* Django 1.1

### Resolution

Patches have been applied to Django trunk, and to the 1.2 and 1.1
release branches, which resolve the issues described above. The
patches may be obtained directly from the following changesets:

* Django trunk: [15464](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15464) for the CSRF issue, [15470](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15470) for the file field issue and [15467](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15467) for the file-storage issue.
* Django 1.2: [15465](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15465) for the CSRF issue, [15471](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15471) for the file field issue and [15468](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15468) for the file-storage issue.
* Django 1.1: [15466](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15466) for the CSRF issue, [15472](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15472) for the file field issue and [15469](http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/15469) for the file-storage issue.

The following new releases have been issued:

* Django 1.2.5 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.2/Django-1.2.5.tar.gz) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.2.5.checksum.txt))
* Django 1.1.4 ([download](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/releases/1.1/Django-1.1.4.tar.gz) | [checksums](https://www.djangoproject.com/m/pgp/Django-1.1.4.checksum.txt))

As Django trunk is currently in a beta state, users are strongly
advised not to be running production deployments from it; if you are
currently doing so, however, you are urged to upgrade immediately to
the latest trunk, which contains patches for these issues.

### General notes regarding security

As always, we ask that potential security issues be reported via
private email to security@djangoproject.com, and not via Django's Trac
instance or the django-developers list.

If you are or represent a third-party distributor of Django and did
not receive a notification email regarding this announcement from the
Django release manager, please contact `james@b-list.org`.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
