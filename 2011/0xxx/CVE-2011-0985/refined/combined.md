Package        : chromium-browser
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0777 CVE-2011-0778 CVE-2011-0783 CVE-2011-0983 CVE-2011-0981 CVE-2011-0984 CVE-2011-0985

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2011-0777

  Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via vectors related to image loading

CVE-2011-0778

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly restrict drag and drop
  operations, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
  Policy via unspecified vectors

CVE-2011-0783

  Unspecified vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows
  user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via vectors involving a "bad volume setting."

CVE-2011-0983

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle anonymous blocks,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."

CVE-2011-0981

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform event handling for
  animations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
  possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a
  "stale pointer."

CVE-2011-0984

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle plug-ins, which
  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
  via unspecified vectors

CVE-2011-0985

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform process termination
  upon memory exhaustion, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze2

For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.0.597.98~r74359-1

We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

where are 12 most visited windows in New Tab?

It is a dealbreaker - for 8 I can use Google Chrome

still stuck on 7.0.520

thanks for any effort towards more windows - customizable would be best 8 small windows on 1920\*1080 are useless

Does this version support the "enable cookie prompt" ? I installed it and tried out the webgl stuff, ok, w/e, i don't know how it will benefit me, but obviously, i refuse to give up my cookie prompter version. I forgot to try it. Could you post the changes and any additions, please?

and I hope Iron isn't going in the direction of google, in any way. I refuse to use any google extentions cuz most of them enable tracking. and i don't trust google to notify me during an install that it can access some info, as some do, others don't.

Well, i see your website posting has really sped up! awesome!

Nothing works on this page: <http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl>. Sometime I've got this message: **Could not initialise shaders**. But I don't have any problem with firefox beta 11. What should I do for iron?

I would also like more last visited windows in new tab.

I got used to having 12 and it was great, 8 tabs is just not enough I think. It should be fairly simple to make this change.

When you use view source, you can easily find the line related to last visited tabs...

Code: Select all

```
getMostVisitedLayoutRects_: function() {
      var small = this.useSmallGrid;

      var cols = 4;
      var rows = 2;
      var marginWidth = 10;
      var marginHeight = 7;
      var borderWidth = 4;
      var thumbWidth = small ? 150 : 207;
      var thumbHeight = small ? 93 : 129;
      var w = thumbWidth + 2 * borderWidth + 2 * marginWidth;
      var h = thumbHeight + 40 + 2 * marginHeight;
      var sumWidth = cols * w  - 2 * marginWidth;
      var topSpacing = 10;
```

Just change the value in var rows from 2 to 3 and that should be it!

Please make this change and release an alternate version for those of us who want this feature. Thanks!

Hmm that is not all that needs to be changed. Also the Field size must be changed, in this code:

Code: Select all

```
#most-visited-maxiview {
  position: relative;
  height: 366px;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
}

```

But I can't find the place where the number ob thumbs is defined... If I change it in the iron.dll to 3 cols and 3 rows, there are still only 8 thumbs ![:(](./images/smilies/icon_e_sad.gif "Sad")

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
