I'm not going to assign anything to the "enhancements" unless someone wants
me to. They don't sound like security flaws.

There is more information on these here:
<http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.5>

# Fix XSS bug: Properly encode title used in Quick/Bulk Edit, and offer
  additional sanitization to various fields. Affects users of the Author or
  Contributor role. (r17397, r17406, r17412)
# Fix XSS bug: Preserve tag escaping in the tags meta box. Affects users of
  the Author or Contributor role. (r17401)

Use CVE-2011-0700 for the XSS flaws.

# Fix potential information disclosure of posts through the media uploader.
  Affects users of the Author role. (r17393)

Use CVE-2011-0701 for the information disclosure.

Thanks.

# WordPress 3.0.5 (and 3.1 Release Candidate 4)

---

[WordPress 3.0.5](https://wordpress.org/download/) is now available and is a security hardening update for all previous WordPress versions.

[This security release](https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.0.5) is required if you have any untrusted user accounts, but it also comes with important security enhancements and hardening. All WordPress users are strongly encouraged to update.

Three point oh point five

Enhances security

Three point one comes soon

The release addresses a number of issues and provides two additional enhancements:

**Two moderate security issues** were fixed that could have allowed a Contributor- or Author-level user to gain further access to the site.

**One information disclosure issue** was addressed that could have allowed an Author-level user to view contents of posts they should not be able to see, such as draft or private posts.

**Two security enhancements** were added. One improved the security of any plugins which were not properly leveraging our security API. The other offers additional defense in depth against a vulnerability that was fixed in previous release.

Thanks to Nils Jueneman and Saddy for their private and responsible disclosures to security@wordpress.org for two of the issues. The others were reported or repaired by our security team.

**[Download 3.0.5](https://wordpress.org/download/) or update automatically from the Dashboard > Updates menu in your site’s admin area. Please update immediately.**

---

### WordPress 3.1 Release Candidate 4 is also now available.

The Release Candidate 4 build includes the security fixes and enhancements included in 3.0.5 and addresses about two dozen additional bugs. This includes fixes for:

* Deleting a user and reassigning their posts to another user.
* Marking multiple users or sites as spam in multisite.
* PHP4 compatibility.

As outlined in [previous](https://wordpress.org/news/2011/01/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate-3/) [RC](https://wordpress.org/news/2011/01/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate-2/) [posts](https://wordpress.org/news/2010/12/wordpress-3-1-release-candidate/), if you are testing the release candidate and think you’ve found a bug, there are a few ways to let us know:

* Post it to the [Alpha/Beta area in the support forums](https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/)
* Report it to the [wp-testers mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/mailman/listinfo/wp-testers)
* Join the development IRC channel and tell us live at irc.freenode.net #wordpress-dev
* File a bug ticket on the [WordPress Trac](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/)

To test WordPress 3.1, try the [WordPress Beta Tester plugin](https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/) (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”). Or you can [download the release candidate here](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-RC4.zip) (zip). If any new issues become known, you’ll be able to [find them here](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/6).

After nearly five months of development and testing, we think we’re very close to a final release. **Users and developers, please test your themes and plugins.**

Download [WordPress 3.1 RC4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.1-RC4.zip) or [WordPress 3.0.5](https://wordpress.org/download/) now.

<http://wordpress.org/news/2011/02/wordpress-3-0-5/>

From release announcement, I'm unsure which of them deserves CVEs:

"Two moderate security issues were fixed that could have allowed a
Contributor- or Author-level user to gain further access to the site.

One information disclosure issue was addressed that could have allowed
an Author-level user to view contents of posts they should not be able
to see, such as draft or private posts.

Two security enhancements were added. One improved the security of any
plugins which were not properly leveraging our security API. The other
offers additional defense in depth against a vulnerability that was
fixed in previous release."

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2190-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : wordpress
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0700 CVE-2011-0701

Two XSS bugs and one potential information disclosure issue were discovered
in wordpress, a weblog manager.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2011-0700

  Input passed via the post title when performing a "Quick Edit" or "Bulk Edit"
  action and via the "post_status", "comment_status", and "ping_status"
  parameters is not properly sanitised before being used.
  Certain input passed via tags in the tags meta-box is not properly sanitised
  before being returned to the user.

CVE-2011-0701

  Wordpress incorrectly enforces user access restrictions when accessing posts
  via the media uploader and can be exploited to disclose the contents
  of e.g. private or draft posts.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.5+dfsg-0+squeeze1

For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.5+dfsg-1

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
