## Synopsis

Important: mingw32-libxml2 security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0217)

## Topic

Updated mingw32-libxml2 packages that fix several security issues are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. This advisory also contains
information about future updates for the mingw32 packages, as well as the
deprecation of the packages with the release of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 6.4.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having
important security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
scores, which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each
vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

These packages provide the libxml2 library, a development toolbox providing
the implementation of various XML standards, for users of MinGW (Minimalist
GNU for Windows).

IMPORTANT NOTE: The mingw32 packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 will no
longer be updated proactively and will be deprecated with the release of
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.4. These packages were provided to support other
capabilities in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and were not intended for direct
customer use. Customers are advised to not use these packages with
immediate effect. Future updates to these packages will be at Red Hat's
discretion and these packages may be removed in a future minor release.

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
entity references with long names. A remote attacker could provide a
specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an application linked
against libxml2, would cause the application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application. (CVE-2011-3919)

A heap-based buffer underflow flaw was found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain entities. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2012-5134)

It was found that the hashing routine used by libxml2 arrays was
susceptible to predictable hash collisions. Sending a specially-crafted
message to an XML service could result in longer processing time, which
could lead to a denial of service. To mitigate this issue, randomization
has been added to the hashing function to reduce the chance of an attacker
successfully causing intentional collisions. (CVE-2012-0841)

Multiple flaws were found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath (XML Path
Language) expressions. If an attacker were able to supply a
specially-crafted XML file to an application using libxml2, as well as an
XPath expression for that application to run against the crafted file, it
could cause the application to crash. (CVE-2010-4008, CVE-2010-4494,
CVE-2011-2821, CVE-2011-2834)

Two heap-based buffer overflow flaws were found in the way libxml2 decoded
certain XML files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML
file that, when opened in an application linked against libxml2, would
cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running the application. (CVE-2011-0216,
CVE-2011-3102)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way libxml2 parsed certain XPath expressions. If an attacker
were able to supply a specially-crafted XML file to an application using
libxml2, as well as an XPath expression for that application to run against
the crafted file, it could cause the application to crash or, possibly,
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2011-1944)

An out-of-bounds memory read flaw was found in libxml2. A remote attacker
could provide a specially-crafted XML file that, when opened in an
application linked against libxml2, would cause the application to crash.
(CVE-2011-3905)

Red Hat would like to thank the Google Security Team for reporting the
CVE-2010-4008 issue. Upstream acknowledges Bui Quang Minh from Bkis as the
original reporter of CVE-2010-4008.

All users of mingw32-libxml2 are advised to upgrade to these updated
packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-22 09:34:21 UTC  ``` Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assigned an identifier [CVE-2011-0216](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0216) to the following vulnerability:  Off-by-one error in libxml in Apple Safari before 5.0.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted web site.  References: [1] <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0216> [2] <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4808> [3] <http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2011//Jul/msg00002.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-22 09:37:22 UTC  ``` Unfortunately right now we don't have further information about this flaw, than it is listed above. Thus not sure, if this flaw might be applicable to libxml / libxml2 / mingw32-libxml2 package versions, as shipped across different Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora products.  We have contacted Apple Security Team to provide further details about this issue and once they are provided, this Red Hat Bugzilla issue tracking system entry will be updated accordingly.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c5)  Paul Howarth    2011-08-04 06:30:03 UTC  ``` What about libxml? Are there more details of this vulnerability posted somewhere?   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c18)  Kai Tietz    2011-08-23 10:28:32 UTC  ``` As far as I understood is this CVE not affecting our libxml2 version.  Are any more details for this?  Or is this CVE something to close?  Regards, Kai   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c19)  Paul Howarth    2011-08-23 12:12:59 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c18)) > As far as I understood is this CVE not affecting our libxml2 version.  Are any > more details for this?  Or is this CVE something to close?  According to [Comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c4) it doesn't affect libxml2. However, we still don't know yet if it affects libxml.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2011-11-16 09:50:12 UTC  ``` Upstream commit: <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=69f04562f75212bfcabecd190ea8b06ace28ece2>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c23)  Paul Howarth    2011-11-16 18:51:33 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #21](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c21)) > Upstream commit: > <http://git.gnome.org/browse/libxml2/commit/?id=69f04562f75212bfcabecd190ea8b06ace28ece2>  I don't see any code like that in libxml's encoding.c so I guess that's not vulnerable?   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c24)  Daniel Veillard    2011-11-18 08:34:37 UTC  ``` In what version of encoding.c did you look ? Because that bug has been around forever ... if you mean libxml as libxml version1, then yes it's likely to not have that code, it's more than 10 years old, and I don't think the support for iconv was plugged yet at the time of renaming to libxml2. But any recent version of libxml (i.e. libxml2) is affected.  Daniel   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c25)  Paul Howarth    2011-11-18 09:43:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #24](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c24)) > In what version of encoding.c did you look ?

Yes, I did mean libxml as libxml version1; it's still in Fedora at the moment.   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c26)  Daniel Veillard    2011-11-18 14:05:22 UTC  ``` urgh that should have been deprecated for ages ...

They suggest that Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6. As well as Fedora release 14, 15 and 16 are affected by this flaw.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=724906#c32)  Huzaifa S.

#### Apple TV Software Update 4.4

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information

  Description: Fraudulent certificates were issued by multiple certificate authorities operated by DigiNotar. This issue is addressed by removing DigiNotar from the list of trusted root certificates, from the list of Extended Validation (EV) certificate authorities, and by configuring default system trust settings so that DigiNotar's certificates, including those issued by other authorities, are not trusted.

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: Support for X.509 certificates with MD5 hashes may expose users to spoofing and information disclosure as attacks improve

  Description: Certificates signed using the MD5 hash algorithm were accepted by iOS. This algorithm has known cryptographic weaknesses. Further research or a misconfigured certificate authority could have allowed the creation of X.509 certificates with attacker controlled values that would have been trusted by the system. This would have exposed X.509 based protocols to spoofing, man in the middle attacks, and information disclosure. This update disables support for an X.509 certificate with an MD5 hash for any use other than as a trusted root certificate.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2011-3427

* **Apple TV**

  Available for: Apple TV 4.0 through 4.3

  Impact: An attacker could decrypt part of a SSL connection

  Description: Only the SSLv3 and TLS 1.0 versions of SSL were supported. These versions are subject to a protocol weakness when using block ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker could have injected invalid data, causing the connection to close but revealing some information about the previous data. If the same connection was attempted repeatedly the attacker may eventually have been able to decrypt the data being sent, such as a password. This issue is addressed by adding support for TLS 1.2.

  CVE-ID

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=880466#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2012-11-27 04:18:10 UTC  ``` A heap-buffer overflow was found in the way libxml2 decoded certain XML entitites. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which once opened in an application linked against libxml would cause that application to crash, or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.
