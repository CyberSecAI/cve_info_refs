  "CVE-2011-0674": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "docs.microsoft.com_2b0cf2e5_20250125_064712.html",
      "Title": "Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034 - Important",
      "Date": "April 12, 2011"
    },
    "Vulnerability Description": "The vulnerability is caused by improper Kernel-mode driver object management, specifically a use-after-free vulnerability within Win32k.sys. This can lead to an elevation of privilege.",
    "Root Cause": "Improper management of kernel-mode driver objects within Windows Kernel-mode drivers.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, enabling them to install programs, view, change or delete data, and create new accounts with full user rights. This results in complete control of the affected system and privilege escalation.",
    "Attack Vectors": "An attacker must log on locally to the system and then run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.",
     "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally. They also need the ability to execute a specially crafted application."
