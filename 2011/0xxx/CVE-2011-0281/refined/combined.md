SUMMARY
=======
The MIT krb5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to
denial of service attacks from unauthenticated remote attackers.
CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282 occur only in KDCs using LDAP back
ends, but CVE-2011-0283 occurs in all krb5-1.9 KDCs.
Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are easy
to trigger manually. The trigger for CVE-2011-0281 has already been
disclosed publicly, but that fact might not be obvious to casual
readers of the message in which it was disclosed. The triggers for
CVE-2011-0282 and CVE-2011-0283 have not yet been disclosed publicly,
but they are also trivial.
IMPACT
======
CVE-2011-0281: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC
configured with an LDAP back end to become completely unresponsive
until restarted.
CVE-2011-0282: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC
configured with an LDAP back end to crash with a null pointer
dereference.
CVE-2011-0283: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a krb5-1.9
KDC with any back end to crash with a null pointer dereference.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282: The KDC in releases krb5-1.6 and
later are vulnerable. Earlier releases did not contain the LDAP back
end code, and are therefore not vulnerable to these issues.
CVE-2011-0283: The KDC in krb5-1.9 is vulnerable. Earlier releases
did not contain the bug.
FIXES
=====
\* Workaround: restart the KDC when it becomes unresponsive or crashes,
possibly using an automated monitoring process.
\* The patch for the krb5-1.9 release is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch.txt
A PGP-signed patch is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch.txt.asc
\* The patch for the krb5-1.8 and krb5-1.7 releases is at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch-r18.txt
For the 1.7 releases, apply the patch ignoring whitespace
(use "patch -l").

DETAILS
=======
CVE-2011-0281: KDC vulnerable to hang when using LDAP back end
The LDAP KDC database back end converts an internal representation of
the protocol encoding of a Kerberos principal name into a single C
string in order to do a lookup in LDAP. The "unparse" code that does
this transformation can produce backslash escape sequences which the
LDAP client library rejects during the LDAP lookup. The LDAP KDC
database back end loops attempting to reconnect to the LDAP server,
but leaks file descriptors while doing so.
When the amount of leakage reaches a file descriptor limit (e.g.,
FD\_SETSIZE), the KDC may become unresponsive. One possibility is that
having more than FD\_SETSIZE open file descriptors causes select() to
become incapable of detecting status changes on the newest file
descriptor that the KDC uses to communicate with the LDAP server.
CVE-2011-0282: KDC vulnerable to crash when using LDAP back end
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: None
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 6.8
Exploitability: High
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
The KDC LDAP back end, when testing whether a principal belongs to the
default realm, assumes that principal name components are
null-terminated and are not null pointers. Both of these assumptions
are invalid in the general case, so an attacker could craft a
principal name to induce a null pointer dereference or reading beyond
the end of a buffer, causing a crash. Data leakage resulting from the
overrun is essentially impossible because the read operation is a
comparison rather than a copy.
CVE-2011-0283: krb5-1.9 KDC vulnerable to crash
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: None
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 6.8
Exploitability: High
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
Changes in the KDC network code in the krb5-1.9 release introduced a
bug that allows a null pointer dereference, which would cause the KDC
to crash. Any request packet that is sufficiently malformed that the
KDC would not generate a response packet can trigger this bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

SUMMARY
=======
The MIT krb5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to
denial of service attacks from unauthenticated remote attackers.
CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282 occur only in KDCs using LDAP back
ends, but CVE-2011-0283 occurs in all krb5-1.9 KDCs.
Exploit code is not known to exist, but the vulnerabilities are easy
to trigger manually. The trigger for CVE-2011-0281 has already been
disclosed publicly, but that fact might not be obvious to casual
readers of the message in which it was disclosed. The triggers for
CVE-2011-0282 and CVE-2011-0283 have not yet been disclosed publicly,
but they are also trivial.
IMPACT
======
CVE-2011-0281: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC
configured with an LDAP back end to become completely unresponsive
until restarted.
CVE-2011-0282: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a KDC
configured with an LDAP back end to crash with a null pointer
dereference.
CVE-2011-0283: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a krb5-1.9
KDC with any back end to crash with a null pointer dereference.
AFFECTED SOFTWARE
=================
CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282: The KDC in releases krb5-1.6 and
later are vulnerable. Earlier releases did not contain the LDAP back
end code, and are therefore not vulnerable to these issues.
CVE-2011-0283: The KDC in krb5-1.9 is vulnerable. Earlier releases
did not contain the bug.
FIXES
=====
\* Workaround: restart the KDC when it becomes unresponsive or crashes,
possibly using an automated monitoring process.
\* The patch for the krb5-1.9 release is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch.txt
A PGP-signed patch is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch.txt.asc
\* The patch for the krb5-1.8 and krb5-1.7 releases is at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch-r18.txt
For the 1.7 releases, apply the patch ignoring whitespace
(use "patch -l").
A PGP-signed patch is available at
http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/advisories/2011-002-patch-r18.txt.asc
\* The following patch applies to the krb5-1.6 release series.

DETAILS
=======
CVE-2011-0281: KDC vulnerable to hang when using LDAP back end
The LDAP KDC database back end converts an internal representation of
the protocol encoding of a Kerberos principal name into a single C
string in order to do a lookup in LDAP. The "unparse" code that does
this transformation can produce backslash escape sequences which the
LDAP client library rejects during the LDAP lookup. The LDAP KDC
database back end loops attempting to reconnect to the LDAP server,
but leaks file descriptors while doing so.
When the amount of leakage reaches a file descriptor limit (e.g.,
FD\_SETSIZE), the KDC may become unresponsive. One possibility is that
having more than FD\_SETSIZE open file descriptors causes select() to
become incapable of detecting status changes on the newest file
descriptor that the KDC uses to communicate with the LDAP server.
CVE-2011-0282: KDC vulnerable to crash when using LDAP back end
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: None
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 6.8
Exploitability: High
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
The KDC LDAP back end, when testing whether a principal belongs to the
default realm, assumes that principal name components are
null-terminated and are not null pointers. Both of these assumptions
are invalid in the general case, so an attacker could craft a
principal name to induce a null pointer dereference or reading beyond
the end of a buffer, causing a crash. Data leakage resulting from the
overrun is essentially impossible because the read operation is a
comparison rather than a copy.
CVE-2011-0283: krb5-1.9 KDC vulnerable to crash
CVSSv2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:H/RL:OF/RC:C
CVSSv2 Base Score: 7.8
Access Vector: Network
Access Complexity: Low
Authentication: None
Confidentiality Impact: None
Integrity Impact: None
Availability Impact: Complete
CVSSv2 Temporal Score: 6.8
Exploitability: High
Remediation Level: Official Fix
Report Confidence: Confirmed
Changes in the KDC network code in the krb5-1.9 release introduced a
bug that allows a null pointer dereference, which would cause the KDC
to crash. Any request packet that is sufficiently malformed that the
KDC would not generate a response packet can trigger this bug.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- exim
Exim was updated to verify the return value of the setuid/setgid calls
now. (CVE-2011-0017)
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- krb5
Multiple KDC DoS vulnerabilities if used with LDAP backends have been
fixed in krb5. CVE-2011-0281 and CVE-2011-0282 have been assigned.
Additionally a DoS vulnerability in kpropd has been fixed in openSUSE.
CVE-2010-4022 has been assigned to this issue.
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- git
This update fixes two vulnerabilities:
+ CVE-2010-3906: XSS vulnerability in gitweb; a remote attacker could
craft an URL such that arbitrary content would be inserted to the
generated web page.
+ CVE-2010-2542: Stack overflow vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary
code execution if user runs any git command on a specially crafted git
working copy.
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- dbus-1
Local users could crash the D-Bus daemon by sending a specially crafted
message (CVE-2010-4352).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
