{
  "CVE-2011-0281": {
    "Root cause": "The LDAP KDC database back end converts an internal representation of the protocol encoding of a Kerberos principal name into a single C string for LDAP lookup. The \"unparse\" code can generate backslash escape sequences that the LDAP client library rejects. The LDAP KDC backend loops attempting to reconnect, leaking file descriptors.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of backslash escape sequences in principal names",
      "File descriptor leak on LDAP reconnect failures",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause the KDC to become unresponsive until restarted due to file descriptor exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based, sending crafted principal name with backslash escape sequence to a KDC using an LDAP backend",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network requests to the KDC"
  },
  "CVE-2011-0282": {
    "Root cause": "The KDC LDAP backend assumes principal name components are null-terminated and not null pointers, which is not always true. An attacker can craft a name to trigger a null pointer dereference or out-of-bounds read, leading to a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference due to incorrect assumptions about principal name components",
      "Potential buffer over-read due to incorrect assumptions about null termination"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause the KDC to crash with a null pointer dereference or a buffer over-read.",
      "Attack vectors": "Network-based, sending a crafted principal name to a KDC with LDAP backend",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network requests to the KDC"
  },
   "CVE-2011-0283": {
    "Root cause": "Changes in the KDC network code in krb5-1.9 introduced a bug that allows a null pointer dereference. Malformed requests that would not generate a response can trigger this.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Null pointer dereference due to malformed request handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can cause the KDC to crash with a null pointer dereference.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based, sending malformed request packets that do not generate a response to krb5-1.9 KDC",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to send network requests to the KDC"
