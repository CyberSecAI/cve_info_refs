```
Root cause of vulnerability: A use-after-free flaw in the Linux kernel's RPC server sockets implementation within the lockd component. The issue was caused by an incomplete backport of an upstream commit in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper handling of invalid data packets by lockd, leading to a use-after-free condition.

Impact of exploitation: A remote unauthenticated attacker could send a corrupted packet to crash the server, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).

Attack vectors: Sending a specially crafted, invalid data packet to a vulnerable server over the network.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable server. No special authentication is required.
