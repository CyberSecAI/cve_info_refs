Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-0999:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Linux kernel handles transparent hugepages (THP) during the copying of arguments and environment variables into the user stack. Specifically, THP could be created for the user stack even when it was considered temporary (`is_vma_temporary_stack()` was true), which should not occur. This occurs because  "Transparent hugepages can only be created if rmap is fully functional."

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of memory allocation for the user stack during the copying of arguments and environment variables.
- Failure to prevent the use of THP when the user stack is considered temporary, leading to unexpected memory management behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A specially crafted binary could cause the user stack to grow excessively large, backed by hugepages. This could lead to resource exhaustion or other unexpected system behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by executing a specially crafted binary designed to manipulate the user stack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Ability to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in the Linux kernel version 2.6.38-rc1 via commit `71e3aac0`.
- The fix for this issue involves preventing hugepages from being created when `is_vma_temporary_stack()` is true, as well as some minor optimization and `BUG_ON` to `VM_BUG_ON` changes.
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via errata RHSA-2011:0542 and RHSA-2011:0883.
- The vulnerability only affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 because versions 4, 5, and MRG did not include the vulnerable commit.
