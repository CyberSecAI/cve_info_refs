Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0400:

**Verification:**

The provided content includes a reference to issue #1795: "Login via https should set cookieâ€™s secure flag". This issue directly relates to the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0400, which is a missing secure flag on cookies over HTTPS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the absence of the `secure` flag when setting cookies over HTTPS. This means that the cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, even if the user initially logged in over HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Missing Secure Flag:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of the `secure` flag on cookies when they are set during a login over HTTPS. This allows the cookie to be transmitted over unencrypted channels, potentially exposing it to interception.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can potentially intercept the session cookie via a man-in-the-middle attack if the cookie is transmitted over an unencrypted channel. This intercepted cookie can then be used by the attacker to impersonate the legitimate user, gaining unauthorized access to their account.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack:** The attack vector is a MitM attack where an attacker intercepts network traffic. If a user who has logged in over HTTPS then accesses the same website over HTTP, the session cookie will be sent over the unencrypted channel. The attacker can capture this cookie and use it to hijack the user's session.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the user and the server. This can be achieved by being on the same local network (e.g. a public Wi-Fi) or by compromising a network device.
- **Passive Interception:** The attack does not require active manipulation of the traffic, it is enough to passively intercept the insecure cookie transmission.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content references a fix in Matomo 1.1, suggesting that this vulnerability was present in earlier versions.
- The issue description in the Github issue  #1795  suggests that the `Cookie.php` file needs to be modified to include the optional secure flag or add a `setSecure()` method.

In summary, CVE-2011-0400 arises from the failure to set the secure flag on cookies transmitted over HTTPS, allowing an attacker with network access to potentially intercept session cookies and compromise user accounts via session hijacking.
