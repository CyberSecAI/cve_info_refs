  "CVE-2011-0058": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled very long strings. When very long strings were constructed and inserted into an HTML document, the browser would incorrectly construct the layout objects used to display the text. Under such conditions, an incorrect length would be calculated for a text run resulting in too small of a memory buffer being allocated to store the text. This issue could be used by an attacker to write data past the end of the buffer and execute malicious code on a victim's computer.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow when calculating the buffer size for a text run when processing very long strings with complex unicode characters.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Integer overflow leading to heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker could write data past the end of the buffer and execute malicious code on a victim's computer.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious HTML document with a very long string containing complex unicode characters, setting a large font weight, and inserting it into a narrow div."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious HTML page that can be rendered by a vulnerable browser instance.",
