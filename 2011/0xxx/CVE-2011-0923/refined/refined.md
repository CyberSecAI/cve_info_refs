Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper input validation of `EXEC_CMD` arguments within the HP Data Protector client. Specifically, the client does not adequately sanitize or check the arguments passed to the `EXEC_CMD` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation for arguments supplied to the `EXEC_CMD` command. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability enables remote attackers to execute arbitrary Perl code on the vulnerable system. This is due to the client's ability to execute files from its local bin directory in conjunction with the lack of input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows for complete control over the affected system, granting the attacker full access to confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    *   **Confidentiality Impact: Complete** - Attackers can access all sensitive data on the system.
    *   **Integrity Impact: Complete** - Attackers can modify or delete any data on the system.
    *   **Availability Impact: Complete** - Attackers can disrupt or disable system services, rendering them unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attacks:** This vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning attackers do not need local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Crafted Commands:** Attackers send specially crafted commands using `EXEC_CMD`, including arguments designed to exploit the lack of input validation.
*   **Perl Code Execution:** The client's functionality to execute files within its local bin directory allows injected Perl code within the crafted commands to be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** Attackers must be able to communicate with the vulnerable HP Data Protector client over the network.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The exploit can be performed without needing any form of authentication.
*   **Basic Exploitation Skills:** The exploit is relatively straightforward, requiring only basic network programming skills to craft the necessary commands.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS base score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation).
*   Affected software versions include HP OpenView Storage Data Protector v6.11, v6.10 and v6.00 running on Windows, HP-UX, Linux, or Solaris.

In summary, CVE-2011-0923 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in HP Data Protector that results from insufficient input validation. It is easily exploitable remotely with no authentication required.
