{
  "CVE-2011-0523": {
    "description": "Gypsy allows regular users to request that arbitrary files be opened for reading, which can lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation. Additionally, the application has unchecked buffer overflows in gps_channel_garmin_input() via nmeabuf and nmea_gpgsv() which could be exploited.",
    "root_cause": "The Gypsy daemon, running as root, opens arbitrary files specified by regular users without proper validation, and also contains unchecked buffer overflows when handling NMEA data.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary file access",
      "Buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure, privilege escalation, denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local user can request to open arbitrary files.",
      "Local user can attach gypsy to a pseudo-tty to trigger buffer overflows."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local user access."
  }
