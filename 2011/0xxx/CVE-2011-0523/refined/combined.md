| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c0)  Kees Cook    2011-01-24 13:54:52 UTC  ``` [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gypsy/+bug/690323](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/gypsy/%2Bbug/690323)  Regular users can request that arbitrary files be opened for reading. In the best case, this is a denial of service. Worst-case, this could lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation.  ** (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Creating client for /etc/shadow ** (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Device name: shadow ** (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Registered client on /org/freedesktop/Gypsy/shadow ** (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Starting connection to /etc/shadow ** (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Starting connection to /etc/shadow open("/etc/shadow", O_RDONLY|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK) = 6 open("/etc/shadow", O_RDWR|O_NOCTTY|O_NONBLOCK) = 7 ** (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: GPS channel can connect  There appear to be unchecked buffer overflows as well in gps_channel_garmin_input() via nmeabuf and nmea_gpgsv(), which could be used in an attack. (If the local user attaches gypsy to a pseudo-tty they might be able to trick the string handling.) ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c1)  Bastien Nocera    2011-10-12 03:58:01 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 52255](attachment.cgi?id=52255 "security fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=52255&action=edit "security fix") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=33431&attachment=52255) security fix  Patch by Michael Leibowitz, further modified by myself. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c2)  Bastien Nocera    2011-10-12 04:17:12 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 52256](attachment.cgi?id=52256 "Fix buffer overflows in 0.8 codebase") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=52256&action=edit "Fix buffer overflows in 0.8 codebase") [[review]](page.cgi?id=splinter.html&bug=33431&attachment=52256) Fix buffer overflows in 0.8 codebase ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c3)  Bastien Nocera    2011-10-12 04:22:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c0)) <snip> > There appear to be unchecked buffer overflows as well in > gps_channel_garmin_input() via nmeabuf and nmea_gpgsv(), which could be used in > an attack. (If the local user attaches gypsy to a pseudo-tty they might be able > to trick the string handling.)  Note that this is only a problem in the 0.8 codebase, the latest master's parsing code is completely rewritten and doesn't use sprintf() anymore. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c4)  iain    2011-10-12 07:36:26 UTC  ``` Now that we have the discovery system in master, we could use that to only allow known device files to be connected to ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c5)  Bastien Nocera    2011-10-13 02:11:10 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c4)) > Now that we have the discovery system in master, we could use that to only > allow known device files to be connected to  That could be a second keyword for the conf file (bluetooth-known). Though I'd like to say that the current code will hide a lot of older Bluetooth GPS devices because they don't use the correct Class (the positioning device class was fairly recent). ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c6)  Bastien Nocera    2011-10-31 06:50:25 UTC  ``` Could I get some review on those patches? ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c7)  Bastien Nocera    2012-04-16 08:39:22 UTC  ``` Again, can I get a review on those patches, please? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c8)  Kees Cook    2012-04-17 13:32:31 UTC  ``` Buffer overflow fixes look fine to me.  I still prefer that udev or something is used to set permissions on devices and that this daemon run as a non-root user. The whitelist is better than nothing, but it'd be nice to see this not running as root at all. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=33431#c9)  iain    2012-05-14 07:31:04 UTC  ``` Have committed the first patch. The second patch no longer applies to the codebase as the whole NMEA parser system has been removed and there isn't a 0.8 branch to apply it to. ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

### Bug Description

Regular users can request that arbitrary files be opened for reading. In the best case, this is a denial of service. Worst-case, this could lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation.

\*\* (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Creating client for /etc/shadow

\*\* (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Device name: shadow

\*\* (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Registered client on /org/freedesktop/Gypsy/shadow

\*\* (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Starting connection to /etc/shadow

\*\* (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: Starting connection to /etc/shadow

open("/etc/shadow", O\_RDONLY|O\_NOCTTY|O\_NONBLOCK) = 6

open("/etc/shadow", O\_RDWR|O\_NOCTTY|O\_NONBLOCK) = 7

\*\* (gypsy-daemon:23540): DEBUG: GPS channel can connect

There appear to be unchecked buffer overflows as well in gps\_channel\_garmin\_input() via nmeabuf and nmea\_gpgsv(), which could be used in an attack. (If the local user attaches gypsy to a pseudo-tty they might be able to trick the string handling.)

Regular users can request that arbitrary files be opened for reading. In the best case, this is a denial of service. Worst-case, this could lead to information disclosure or privilege escalation.

the whole program has code like this in countless places:

char nmeabuf[256];

        nmea\_foobar(foo, nmeabuf);

nmea\_foobar(foo2\* foo, char\* bar)

{

           char buf[256];

    sprintf(buf, ....);

unsigned char cksum = nmea\_cksum(buf);

    sprintf(bar, "$%s\*%02X\r\n", buf, cksum);

}

so at least we'd have to make buf a few bytes smaller to have a chance,

but I guess that does not even completely fix one of the two issues

"gps multiplexing daemon" to let multiple clients access gps devices.

does not really sound too common.

I did not even know I was assigned to this package, had never touched it before.

Vincent, you're the only one listed in the changelog of this package, can you

comment on the importance of this package ?

It's not an essential package, but without it, only one app can access to a gps device, which is an issue if many apps are doing geolocation -- it's starting to become common.

If we consider dropping the package, I guess some review to know what else is wrong would be nice, so that upstream can go ahead and fix things.

Two vulnerabilities were reported [1],[2] in gypsy, a GPS multiplexing daemon.

The first is that it reads arbitrary files as the root user on behalf of a regular user (CVE-2011-0523). The second is that there is a buffer overflow in nmea device input handling which could potentially lead to privilege escalation (CVE-2011-0524). Both issues have been reported upstream [3], however there has been no response (the Ubuntu bug indicates upstream was noticed 20101214 with no response. There is also a SUSE bug [4] with some further information.

maybe policykit can be of use here for a non-intrusive change.

Define two actions "device-open" and "device-change". The former could be granted to local, active sessions by default. The latter should be auth\_admin. By starting with no device defined the daemon would require admin auth once to set the initial device. The daemon stores the device name in a config file. As long as the user requests to open only that device the "device-open" action would be granted. If the user changes the device the "device-change" action requires admin auth again. That way overly paranoid checks at device open time are not needed.

It seems there's a patch been added (only just saw it) but I'm not able to make a judgement on whether it fixes the problem. Quite happy to patch and push it in Fedora if someone can review and ACK it.

Thanks, Peter. I've got it. I think that patch should be ok; might be nice to get it into Fedora and test it out if nothing else. The patch only addresses CVE-2011-0523 (the first issue) from what I can tell, and not the buffer overflow in nmea device handling. Has that been discussed upstream at all?

I still see no activity in the upstream git -- do we know if this patch will land there?

Note that this is only a problem in the 0.8 codebase, the latest master's parsing code is completely rewritten and doesn't use sprintf() anymore.

That could be a second keyword for the conf file (bluetooth-known). Though I'd like to say that the current code will hide a lot of older Bluetooth GPS devices because they don't use the correct Class (the positioning device class was fairly recent).

Please go ahead. The glob restrictions are not really a good solution though as it still allows users to specify devices that they problably shouldn't because there's other hardware connected (or a vt in case of e.g. /dev/tty1).

I agree with Kees, this should be fixed in a better way than with a whitelist.

That being said, I don't mind sponsoring this fix to earlier releases until something better comes along.

I took a look at the precise package, and the debdiffs for the previous releases, and none of them actually ship the whitelist config file in the binary packages (/etc/gypsy.conf).

Please fix that in precise, and submit updated debdiffs. Thanks.

Kees, I know that this is only a workaround and not a proper fix. But as upstream is pretty inactive at the moment I don't think another solution is likely to come soon.

Marc, thanks for spotting, sorry for that. Updated debdiffs attached.

Thanks for the updated debdiffs Andreas. ACK.

I have uploaded them to be built, and will release them as security updates today.

The only thing I did was regenerate the autoreconf patch, as I didn't have any way to review it.

 -- Andreas Moog <email address hidden> Sat, 11 Feb 2012 16:02:45 +0100

This bug was fixed in the package gypsy - 0.8-0ubuntu1.1
---------------
gypsy (0.8-0ubuntu1.1) maverick-security; urgency=low
\* SECURITY UPDATE: "arbitrary file access and buffer overflows"
A new config file, /etc/gypsy.conf, is added that specifies a whitelist
of globs. By default, they are "/dev/tty\*", "/dev/pgps", and "bluetooth"
(which matches Bluetooth addresses).
Thanks to Michael Leibowitz <michael.leibowitz@intel.com>
CVE-2011-0523
\* SECURITY UPDATE: Prevent buffer overflows in NMEA parsing by using
snprintf() instead of sprintf.
Thanks to Bastien Nocera <hadess@hadess.net>

Buffer overflow fixes look fine to me.

I still prefer that udev or something is used to set permissions on devices and that this daemon run as a non-root user. The whitelist is better than nothing, but it'd be nice to see this not running as root at all.

Have committed the first patch.

The second patch no longer applies to the codebase as the whole NMEA parser system has been removed and there isn't a 0.8 branch to apply it to.
