Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `jovgraph.exe` component of HP OpenView Network Node Manager. This Java-based grapher processes user-provided options passed as arguments to the CGI program. The root cause is improper handling of the `displayWidth` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of Authentication:**  Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The `jovgraph.exe` component does not properly validate the `displayWidth` option when it is passed via HTTP requests. This allows attackers to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the `jovgraph.exe` process, which typically runs as the Internet Guest Account on Windows platforms. This can lead to:
*   Complete system compromise, including data theft and modification.
*   Installation of malware.
*   Denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via HTTP requests.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** A remote attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP request to the target host, including a malformed `displayWidth` option as part of the `arg` parameter to the CGI program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to include the malicious payload in the `displayWidth` argument.

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability was assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating critical severity.
*  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a specific Digital Vaccine filter.
*  Hewlett-Packard has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
*  The vulnerability was reported to HP on 2010-09-14, and the public advisory was released on 2011-01-10.
