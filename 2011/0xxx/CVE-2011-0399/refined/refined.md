Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary issue addressed in this release is the lack of a framebuster/frame breaker mechanism in Piwik, which makes it susceptible to clickjacking attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Clickjacking:** The absence of a frame-busting mechanism allows malicious websites to embed the Piwik login form within an iframe. This enables attackers to overlay the legitimate form with a transparent layer, tricking users into performing actions they didn't intend (like entering credentials) on the attacker's site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers can potentially steal user login credentials by intercepting inputs on the framed login form.
- **Unauthorized Actions:** If a logged-in user is tricked into interacting with the framed Piwik application, an attacker could potentially perform actions on behalf of that user, leading to data manipulation or unauthorized access.
- **Loss of User Trust:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can erode user trust in the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Embedding in Iframes:** A malicious website embeds the vulnerable Piwik login page in an iframe without user consent.
- **Overlay Technique:** The attacker overlays the legitimate Piwik interface with a transparent layer to manipulate user interactions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create malicious websites:** Attackers must be able to create and host websites.
- **Knowledge of iframe usage and overlay techniques:** Attackers need technical proficiency to implement the clickjacking attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content from `piwik.org` mentions "critical security fixes" and specifically thanks contributors for their reviews which implies that more than one security vulnerability may have been fixed in this release although only the framebuster issue is mentioned in the provided content.
- The content from `dev.piwik.org` shows the specific issue tracker entry #1679, which confirms the framebuster fix was part of the 1.1 release.
- This update was rated as critical, highlighting the severity of the issue.
