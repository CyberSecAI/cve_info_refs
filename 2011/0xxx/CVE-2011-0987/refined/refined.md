Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0987:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how phpMyAdmin handles bookmarked SQL queries. Specifically, it was possible to create a bookmark containing an SQL query that would be executed unintentionally by other users. This indicates a lack of proper user context management or sanitization when executing bookmarked queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **SQL Injection:** Although not a direct SQL injection in the typical sense, the vulnerability allows an attacker to inject a malicious SQL query via a bookmark that will be executed under a different user context.
-   **Cross-User Data Manipulation:** The core issue is that an attacker can craft a query that, when executed via a bookmark by another user, could lead to data modification or access beyond the permissions of the attacker's user.
-   **Improper Authorization:** The system fails to properly restrict the execution of bookmarked queries, allowing them to be run under the context of the victim user, which violates the principle of least privilege.
-   **Missing sanitization/validation:** The system fails to sanitize/validate SQL queries in bookmarks, allowing for injection of malicious queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Data Modification:** A malicious user could modify database records by crafting SQL queries via bookmarks.
-   **Data Theft:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database through specially crafted queries executed on other user sessions.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a typical privilege escalation, an attacker could use other users' accounts to execute queries that their account wouldn't normally be authorized for, thus circumventing their limited privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the creation of a malicious SQL query in the bookmark feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to have a valid account with the ability to create bookmarks in phpMyAdmin.
-   The attacker needs the phpMyAdmin configuration storage to be set up and enabled, as well as the bookmarks feature enabled.
-   The attacker does not need direct access to other users' sessions/accounts. They leverage the vulnerability to have their query executed under another user.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability is considered critical.
*   The vulnerability was present in phpMyAdmin versions 2.11.x and 3.3.x.
*   The fix was included in versions 3.3.9.2 or newer (2.11.11.3 or newer for the older family).
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-661 and CWE-89.
