#### Safari 5.1 and Safari 5.0.6

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Visiting a maliciously crafted website may lead to a cross-site scripting attack

  Description: In certain situations, Safari may treat a file as HTML, even if it is served with the 'text/plain' content type. This may lead to a cross-site scripting attack on sites that allow untrusted users to post text files. This issue is addressed through improved handling of 'text/plain' content.

  CVE-ID

  CVE-2010-1420 : Hidetake Jo working with Microsoft Vulnerability Research (MSVR), Neal Poole of Matasano Security

* **CFNetwork**

  Available for: Windows 7, Vista, XP SP2 or later

  Impact: Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution

  Description: The NTLM authentication protocol is susceptible to a replay attack referred to as credential reflection. Authenticating to a maliciously crafted website may lead to arbitrary code execution. To mitigate this issue, Safari has been updated to utilize protection mechanisms recently added to Windows.
