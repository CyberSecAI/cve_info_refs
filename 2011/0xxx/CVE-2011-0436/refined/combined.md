Subject: dtc-common: sends password of new users to site admin by unencrypted email

```
Package: dtc-common
Version: 0.29.17-1
Severity: grave
Tags: upstream security

dtc sends the password of new users to the webmaster:

  $mail_content = "
  Somebody tried to register an account. Here is the details of
  the new user:

  login: ".$_REQUEST["reqadm_login"]."
  pass: ".$_REQUEST["reqadm_pass"]."
  [...]
  mail($conf_webmaster_email_addr, "$conf_message_subject_header Somebody tried to register an account", $mail_content, $headers);

(from client/new_account_form.php)

This mail is not encrypted.  I also don't see any reason why the
webmaster should even know the password...

Most of the time, the receiving server would be the same server
receiving the email. If that's not the case, then the admin is free to
setup encryption (and maybe auth) between the 2 SMTP servers.

The reason is very simple: anti-fraud. Many times, you see the same
hacker registering with the same password, and it helps detecting it.
Also, you want the admin to see the weakest password to be able to do a
bit of policing.

This deserves a "wishlist" security at most!!!

So it's "maybe" secure?  And it doesn't help against compromise of the
host where mails are stored.

This really is one of the worst reasons I have ever seen...

No, it's secure by default if the destination email
is in the same computer (or same LAN) which will
most of the time be the case.

Sure, and it doesn't prevent a nuclear bomb to
explode either... Does that count?

Seriously, do you really think that receiving your
administrator messages on a "compromissed host
where mails are stored" counts as an argument here?

Yet thanks to seeing twice the same password, I was
able more than once to delete hacked accounts. Also,
I sometimes lock accounts by changing the client
password, and the history on my email makes it
possible for me to restore the old password. Yet,
don't see this as denying the issue... I didn't
close this bug! :)

You've made your points making these 2 bug reports,
thanks. Now if you want to continue helping, only a
patch will.

Hi,

Here's a patch for not sending passwords (with an option to keep the old
behavior if you want to).

Package        : dtc

Problem type   : remote

CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0434 CVE-2011-0435 CVE-2011-0436 CVE-2011-0437
Debian Bug     : 614302

Ansgar Burchardt discovered several vulnerabilities in DTC, a web
control panel for admin and accounting hosting services.

CVE-2011-0434
    The bw_per_moth.php graph contains an SQL injection vulnerability.

CVE-2011-0435
    Insufficient checks in bw_per_month.php can lead to bandwidth
    usage information disclosure.

CVE-2011-0436
    After a registration, passwords are sent in cleartext
    email messages.

CVE-2011-0437
    Authenticated users could delete accounts using an obsolete
    interface which was incorrectly included in the package.

This update introduces a new configuration option which controls the
presence of cleartext passwords in email messages.  The default is not
to include cleartext passwords

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.17-1+lenny1.

The stable distribution (squeeze) and the the testing distribution
(wheezy) do not contain any dtc packages.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.32.10-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

blists is a registered project with
