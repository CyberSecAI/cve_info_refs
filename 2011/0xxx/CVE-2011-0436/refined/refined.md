Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0436:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `register_user` function in `client/new_account_form.php` of Domain Technologie Control (DTC) includes a new user's password in cleartext within an email message sent to the site administrator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission:** Passwords are sent unencrypted over email, making them vulnerable to interception.
*   **Information Exposure:** The site administrator receives the user's password, which is generally unnecessary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** Attackers who can sniff network traffic or compromise the email server can obtain user passwords.
*   **Account Compromise:**  Compromised passwords can be used to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the server and the administrator's email server can eavesdrop on the email and extract the cleartext passwords.
*   **Email Server Compromise:** If the administrator's email server or mailbox is compromised, attackers can access the stored emails containing user passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic or have access to the administrator's email server/mailbox.
*   **No prior authentication** is required to trigger this vulnerability as it occurs during user registration.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
*   The vulnerability is present in DTC versions before 0.32.9.
*   The fix involved a new configuration option to control cleartext passwords in emails. By default, the fix does not include cleartext passwords.
*   A discussion in the Debian bug report (#614302) reveals that the initial maintainer considered this a low severity "wishlist" item for anti-fraud purposes. However,  it was later correctly categorized as a security issue and assigned the CVE ID.

**Summary**
The core issue is the transmission of cleartext passwords via email during user registration within the DTC software. This exposes the passwords to network eavesdropping and email server compromises, leading to potential unauthorized access to user accounts.
