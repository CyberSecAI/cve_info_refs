      "source": "zerodayinitiative.com_75e753ba_20250124_214433.html",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists within the application's support for the office drawing file format. When parsing shape data within a particular container, the application will add a reference to an object to a linked list. If an error occurs during parsing, the application will free each element yet fail to remove the reference. Afterward, the application will use this reference.",
