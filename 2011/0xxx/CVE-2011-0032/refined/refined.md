    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-0032",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft DirectShow incorrectly restricts the path used for loading external libraries.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure loading of DLL files by Microsoft DirectShow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could take complete control of an affected system, install programs, view/change/delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Convincing a user to open a media file (e.g., .wtv, .drv-ms, or .mpg) located in the same network directory as a specially crafted DLL file.",
         "Email attack: sending a legitimate media file attachment to a user, convincing them to place it in a directory with a crafted DLL file, and opening the media file.",
         "Network attack: placing a media file and a crafted DLL in a network share, UNC, or WebDAV location and convincing the user to open the media file."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a media file. They also need to place a malicious DLL file in a location accessible by the user (e.g. network share, WebDAV, or same directory).",
      "additional_information": "The vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities described in Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637, which affects how applications load external libraries. The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall which may limit some attack vectors."

      "cve_id": "CVE-2011-0042",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Windows Media Player and Windows Media Center do not properly parse specially crafted .dvr-ms media files.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper parsing of .dvr-ms media files."

         "Convincing a user to open a specially crafted .dvr-ms file, either sent as an email attachment or hosted on a malicious website.",
         "Web-based attack: hosting a website with content to exploit the vulnerability, or compromising a website to contain the malicious content."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious .dvr-ms file. This can be achieved through email or a malicious website. The attacker would also need the ability to create a malicious .dvr-ms file.",
          "additional_information": "Exploitation is not automatic. A user must be convinced to open a specially crafted .dvr-ms file."
