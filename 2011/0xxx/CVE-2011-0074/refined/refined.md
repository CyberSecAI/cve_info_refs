  - Root cause of vulnerability:
    - CVE-2011-0074: A malformed HTML document with multiple marquee elements causes a crash due to an invalid memory access in `nsStyleSet::GetContext`. This occurs because of an incorrect handling of frame tree depth and the `NS_FRAME_IS_COMPLETE` status, causing a dangling pointer in `nsIFrame::IBSplitSpecialPrevSibling`.
    - CVE-2011-0075: A crash occurs when an iframe with a specially crafted source address is encountered, due to an improper return path in `nsIndexedToHTML::OnStartRequest`, leading to `OnStopRequest` being called with `mRequest` being null.

  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
    - CVE-2011-0074: Memory corruption due to a dangling pointer and incorrect handling of frame tree depth.
    - CVE-2011-0075: Dangling pointer vulnerability because of incorrect handling of resource URLs, leading to a null dereference.

  - Impact of exploitation:
    - CVE-2011-0074: Arbitrary code execution via memory corruption, potentially leading to a complete takeover of the affected machine.
    - CVE-2011-0075: Arbitrary code execution due to a null dereference when processing an iframe with a malformed source.

  - Attack vectors:
    - CVE-2011-0074: Visiting a malicious web page with a malformed HTML document.
    - CVE-2011-0075: Visiting a web page that contains an iframe with a malformed source. This can be exploited by having a remote server serve a malicious HTML page, or by an attacker getting the victim to open a local HTML file containing the malicious code. It may also be possible to exploit via FTP directory listings.

  - Required attacker capabilities/position:
    - CVE-2011-0074: Ability to serve malicious web content, or convincing a user to open a malicious HTML file.
    - CVE-2011-0075: Ability to serve malicious web content, or convincing a user to open a malicious HTML file. Ability to provide an FTP listing that would trigger the vulnerability.
