##### 1. Summary

VMware vCenter Server directory traversal and information disclosure vulnerabilities. vSphere Client Installer is delivered through an unsigned package.

##### 2. Relevant releases

vCenter Server 4.1 GA
vCenter Server 4.0 Update 2 and earlier
VirtualCenter 2.5 Update 6 and earlier

ESXi 4.1 GA
ESXi 4.0 without patch ESXi400-201103402-SG

ESX 4.1 GA

##### 3. Problem Description

a. vCenter Server Directory Traversal vulnerability
A directory traversal vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely retrieve files from vCenter Server without authentication. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker will need to have access to the network on which the vCenter Server host resides.

In case vCenter Server is installed on Windows 2008 or Windows 2008 R2, the security vulnerability is not present.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2011-0426 to this issue.

\* vCenter 4.1 and vCenter 4.0 installed on Windows 2008 or Windows 2008 R2 are not affected \*\* hosted products are VMware Workstation, Player, ACE, Fusion.

#####

b. vCenter Server SOAP ID disclosure
The SOAP session ID can be retrieved by any user that is logged in to vCenter Server. This might allow a local unprivileged user on vCenter Server to elevate his or her privileges.

VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2011-1788 to this issue.

#####

c. vSphere Client Installer package not digitally signed
The digitally signed vSphere Client installer is packaged in a self-extracting installer package which is not digitally signed. As a result, when you run the install package file to extract and start installing, the vSphere Client installer may display a Windows warning message stating that the publisher of the install package cannot be verified.

The vSphere Client Installer package of the following Product Versions is now digitally signed:

vCenter Server 4.1 Update 1
vCenter Server 4.0 Update 3

ESXi 4.1 Update 1
ESXi 4.0 with patch ESXi400-201103402-SG

ESX 4.1 Update 1
ESX 4.0 with patch ESX400-201103401-SG

An install or update of the vSphere Client from these releases will not present a security warning from Windows. Note: typically the vSphere Client will request an update if the existing client is pointed at a newer version of vCenter or ESX.

VMware Knowledge Base article 1021404 explains how the unsigned install package can be obtained in an alternative, secure way for an environment with VirtualCenter 2.5, ESXi/ESX 3.5 or ESX 3.0.3.

VMware would like to thank Claudio Criscione for reporting this issue to us.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2011-1789 to this issue.
