Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0505:

**1. Verification:**

The exploit-db.com content directly references CVE-2011-0505, confirming that the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `system.php` file of the Zwii application, where the template path is derived from a user-supplied parameter without proper sanitization, leading to a Remote File Inclusion (RFI).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** The application includes a file based on the `set[template][value]` parameter, allowing an attacker to include a remote file.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the input provided in the `set` or `set[template][value]` parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a malicious remote file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to potential complete compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious URL with the vulnerable parameters set to a remote file location.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
    *   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any authentication.

**3. Technical Details:**
The vulnerable code snippet is within `system.php`:
```php
include("./templates/". $set["template"]["value"] ."/info.php");
```
The exploit code is:
```
http://localhost/y/system/system.php?set=(your shell)
http://localhost/y/system/system.php?set[template][value]=(your shell)
```

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit-db content offers a functional exploit for this vulnerability, demonstrating how to inject a remote file.
*   The content provides a Google dork to help locate potentially vulnerable instances of the application ("Propuls√© par Zwii 2.1.1").
*   The exploit targets Zwii version 2.1.1.

**5. Other Content:**

The other provided content from vupen.com and secunia.com does not contain relevant information about the vulnerability for this CVE.

**Summary:**

The Zwii application (version 2.1.1) is vulnerable to Remote File Inclusion due to insecure handling of user-supplied parameters used to determine the template path in `system.php`. An attacker can leverage this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the server by including a malicious remote file. This vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with the `set` or `set[template][value]` parameter pointing to attacker controlled server.
