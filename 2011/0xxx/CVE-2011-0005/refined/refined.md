- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "ordering" parameter in the `com_search` module of Joomla! 1.0.x is not properly sanitized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can compromise currently logged-in user/administrator sessions and impersonate arbitrary user actions available under `/administrator/` functions.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the `ordering` parameter of the `com_search` module's URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious code and convince a user to visit it, or otherwise inject the malicious URL. The user must have an active session on the vulnerable website for the session hijacking to be successful.
