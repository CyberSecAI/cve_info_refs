{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `apr_fnmatch` function in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library used an unconstrained recursive algorithm to process '*' wildcards in pattern matching.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unconstrained recursion leading to excessive CPU consumption. The vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker could cause excessive CPU consumption, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can supply a crafted pattern with multiple '*' wildcards, and long name strings to trigger excessive recursive calls to apr_fnmatch.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the apr_fnmatch function. For example, in the case of mod_autoindex, this could be achieved by manipulating the P=pattern request parameter. Specifically, untrusted or attacker-controlled input must be passed to this vulnerable function."
