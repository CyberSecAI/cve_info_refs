Not certain, with respect to httpd, this short statement is probably
enough for the announcement;

  If 'Options Indexes' is configured, an untrusted adminstrator or
  user has control of the contents of the indexed directory, or there
  are very long file paths (e.g. > <n> URL characters) there is the
  possibility of excessive stack memory consumption.  Users are
  cautioned to move to apr 1.4.4 (included in httpd 2.2.18), or to
  configure 'IndexOptions IgnoreClient' in the same configuration
  contexts where 'Options Indexes' is enabled.

In conjunction with svn 1.6.9 I suspect this might demand a CVE, and
that was when I intended that we make plain what APR 1.4.4 corrects, in
conjunction with their other announcement.

I was under the impression this was sensitive to the number of path
components as opposed to the length of the resource name.

In your estimation, does this demand a CVE?  Is there a relevant CVE
already assigned to the BSD operating system?

I was never able to trigger this using win32 default thread stack size.

[![The Apache Portable Runtime Project](https://apr.apache.org/images/apr_logo_wide.png)](https://apr.apache.org/)

# Apache Portable Runtime 1.7.5 Released

The Apache Software Foundation and the Apache Portable Runtime
Project are proud to announce the General Availability of version
1.7.5 of the Apache Portable Runtime library (APR).

In APR 1.7.0 and later, there are a number of specific changes in how APR is deployed
which may be disruptive to existing build strategies:

* The typical cross-process locking stragegy now defaults to
  a pthreads lock which will not leak on abnormal process termination,
  as opposed to the earlier sysv semaphore locking strategy.
  This should result in fewer orphaned locks in misbehaving
  applications.
* Netware users should be aware that APR mis-defined the entity
  representing an "os mutex", and it was missing a level of
  indirection. The new definition should allow the use of the
  apr\_os\_proc\_mutex\_get/\_put API's on the Netware platform but
  requires a rebuild against the APR 1.7.0 or later library.

For detailed changes in this maintenance release, see;

<https://www.apache.org/dist/apr/CHANGES-APR-1.7>
<https://www.apache.org/dist/apr/CHANGES-APR-UTIL-1.7>
<https://www.apache.org/dist/apr/CHANGES-APR-ICONV-1.2>

APR is available for download from:

<https://apr.apache.org/download.cgi>

The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime Project is to create
and maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and
consistent interface to underlying platform-specific
implementations. The primary goal is to provide an API to
which software developers may code and be assured of predictable
if not identical behavior regardless of the platform on which
their software is built. We list all known projects using APR
at https://apr.apache.org/projects.html - so please let us know
if you find our libraries useful in your own projects!

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-05-10 08:44:02 UTC  ``` It was discovered that apr's implementation of the fnmatch function - apr_fnmatch - did not limit number of recursive calls used when matching input string against the pattern.  Sufficiently complex pattern and sufficient long input could cause apr_fnmatch to consume a lot of CPU time while processing such input.  It was reported that httpd exposes this problem via at least mod_autoindex module, which allows remote users to specify pattern via P=pattern request query argument:  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_autoindex.html#query>  It seems this issue was already corrected in upstream SVN via a complete fnmatch implementation re-write including following commits:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1098188> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1098289> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1098799> <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1098902>  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Maksymilian Arciemowicz for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c2)  Joe Orton    2011-05-10 12:20:27 UTC  ``` The rewrite as a single patch is here:  <http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/apr/apr/branches/1.4.x/strings/apr_fnmatch.c?r1=731029&r2=1098902>   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2011-05-11 07:21:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c0)) > It was reported that httpd exposes this problem via at least mod_autoindex > module, which allows remote users to specify pattern via P=pattern request > query argument: >  > <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_autoindex.html#query>  Mitigation:  mod_autoindex can be configured to ignore request query arguments provided by the client by adding IgnoreClient option to the IndexOptions directive:  <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions.ignoreclient>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2011-05-11 07:25:56 UTC  ``` Fixed upstream in APR 1.4.4 and public now via:    [http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@apr.apache.org/msg23961.html](http://www.mail-archive.com/dev%40apr.apache.org/msg23961.html)   <http://www.apache.org/dist/apr/Announcement1.x.html>    Note especially a security fix to APR 1.4.4, stack overflow was possible   due to unconstrained, recursive invocation of apr_fnmatch, as apr_fnmatch   processed '*' wildcards.      * Security: [CVE-2011-0419](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-0419) (<http://cve.mitre.org>)       Reimplement apr_fnmatch() from scratch using a non-recursive algorithm;       now has improved compliance with the fnmatch() spec. [William Rowe]    The APR Project thanks Maksymilian Arciemowicz of SecurityReason for his   research and reporting of this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-11 22:28:36 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:0507 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0507.html>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-22 23:17:13 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBoss Enterprise Web Server 1.0  Via RHSA-2011:0896 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0896.html>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=703390#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-22 23:38:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 5   JBEWS 1.0 for RHEL 4   JBEWS 1 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2011:0897 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0897.html>   ``` |  |

| Log Message: | ``` Security: CVE-2011-0419 Reported by: Maksymilian Arciemowicz <cxib securityreason.com>  Excessive CPU consumption was possible due to the unconstrained, recursive  invocation of apr_fnmatch, as apr_fnmatch processed '*' wildcards.  Introduce new apr_fnmatch implementation.  This delivers optimizations  in some common cases, without the underlying weakness of recursion  present in older implementations.  Submitted by: William Rowe   ``` |

1. A [...] pattern containing a slash is not a pattern; the [ ]'s become regular
   characters
2. A [] or a [!] is not an empty pattern, why would it? The first would never
   match and the second would always match which makes it equivalent to ?
   In those cases the ] is taken as a literal character and does not have
   special meaning.

PR/[41558](http://gnats.NetBSD.org/41558): Stathis Kamperis: Treat a backslash followed by NUL as NUL, instead
of a backslash if FNM_NOESCAPE is not set. According to TOG: a backslash in
a pattern followed by any other character, will match that second character
in the string.

* use _DIAGASSERT() to check pointer arguments against NULL and file
  descriptors against -1 (as appropriate).
* add actual checks which to detect stuff that would trigger_DIAGASSERT(),
  and attempt to return a sane error condition.
* knf some code
* remove some `register' decls.

the first two items result in the addition of code similar to the
following in various functions:

identifier namespace by renaming non standard functions and variables
such that they have a leading underscore.  The library will use those
names internally.  Weak aliases are used to provide the original names
to the API.

This is only the first part of this change.  It is most of the functions
which are implemented in C for all NetBSD ports.  Subsequent changes are
to add the same support to the remaining C files, to assembly files, and
to the automagically generated assembly source used for system calls.
When all of the above is done, ports with weak alias support should add
a definition for __weak_alias to <sys/cdefs.h>.

# Apache HTTP Server 2.2 vulnerabilities

This page lists all security vulnerabilities fixed in released versions of Apache HTTP Server 2.2. Each vulnerability is given a security [impact rating](/security/impact_levels.html) by the Apache security team - please note that this rating may well vary from platform to platform. We also list the versions the flaw is known to affect, and where a flaw has not been verified list the version with a question mark.

Please note that if a vulnerability is shown below as being fixed in a "-dev" release then this means that a fix has been applied to the development source tree and will be part of an upcoming full release.

Please send comments or corrections for these vulnerabilities to the [Security Team](/security_report.html).

### Apache httpd 2.2 is End-of-Life since December 2017 and should not be used. This page only lists security issues that occurred before the End-of-Life. Subsequent issues may have affected 2.2 but will not be investigated or listed here. Users are advised to upgrade to the currently supported released version to address known issues.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.35-never

### low: Use-after-free when using <Limit > with an unrecognized method in .htaccess ("OptionsBleed") ([CVE-2017-9798](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-9798))

When an unrecognized HTTP Method is given in an <Limit {method}> directive in an .htaccess file, and that .htaccess file is processed by the corresponding request, the global methods table is corrupted in the current worker process, resulting in erratic behaviour. This behavior may be avoided by listing all unusual HTTP Methods in a global httpd.conf RegisterHttpMethod directive in httpd release 2.4.25 and later. To permit other .htaccess directives while denying the <Limit > directive, see the AllowOverrideList directive. Source code patch (2.4) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.4.patch Source code patch (2.2) is at; CVE-2017-9798-patch-2.2.patch Note 2.2 is end-of-life, no further release with this fix is planned. Users are encouraged to migrate to 2.4.28 or later for this and other fixes.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Hanno Böck for reporting this issue.

# Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.34

### important: ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() Authentication Bypass ([CVE-2017-3167](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2017-3167))

Use of the ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed. Third-party module writers SHOULD use ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_components(), available in 2.2.34 and 2.4.26, instead of ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw(). Modules which call the legacy ap\_get\_basic\_auth\_pw() during the authentication phase MUST either immediately authenticate the user after the call, or else stop the request immediately with an error response, to avoid incorrectly authenticating the current request.

### n/a: HTTP\_PROXY environment variable "httpoxy" mitigation ([CVE-2016-5387](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-5387))

HTTP\_PROXY is a well-defined environment variable in a CGI process, which collided with a number of libraries which failed to avoid colliding with this CGI namespace. A mitigation is provided for the httpd CGI environment to avoid populating the "HTTP\_PROXY" variable from a "Proxy:" header, which has never been registered by IANA. This workaround and patch are documented in the ASF Advisory at asf-httpoxy-response.txt and incorporated in the 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 releases. Note: This is not assigned an httpd severity, as it is a defect in other software which overloaded well-established CGI environment variables, and does not reflect an error in HTTP server software.

### important: Apache HTTP Request Parsing Whitespace Defects ([CVE-2016-8743](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2016-8743))

Apache HTTP Server, prior to release 2.4.25 (and 2.2.32), accepted a broad pattern of unusual whitespace patterns from the user-agent, including bare CR, FF, VTAB in parsing the request line and request header lines, as well as HTAB in parsing the request line. Any bare CR present in request lines was treated as whitespace and remained in the request field member "the\_request", while a bare CR in the request header field name would be honored as whitespace, and a bare CR in the request header field value was retained the input headers array. Implied additional whitespace was accepted in the request line and prior to the ':' delimiter of any request header lines.

RFC7230 Section 3.5 calls out some of these whitespace exceptions, and section 3.2.3 eliminated and clarified the role of implied whitespace in the grammer of this specification. Section 3.1.1 requires exactly one single SP between the method and request-target, and between the request-target and HTTP-version, followed immediately by a CRLF sequence. None of these fields permit any (unencoded) CTL character whatsoever. Section 3.2.4 explicitly disallowed any whitespace from the request header field prior to the ':' character, while Section 3.2 disallows all CTL characters in the request header line other than the HTAB character as whitespace.

These defects represent a security concern when httpd is participating in any chain of proxies or interacting with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms. In each case where one agent accepts such CTL characters and does not treat them as whitespace, there is the possiblity in a proxy chain of generating two responses from a server behind the uncautious proxy agent. In a sequence of two requests, this results in request A to the first proxy being interpreted as requests A + A' by the backend server, and if requests A and B were submitted to the first proxy in a keepalive connection, the proxy may interpret response A' as the response to request B, polluting the cache or potentially serving the A' content to a different downstream user-agent.

These defects are addressed with the release of Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 and coordinated by a new directive; HttpProtocolOptions Strict which is the default behavior of 2.4.25 and later.

By toggling from 'Strict' behavior to 'Unsafe' behavior, some of the restrictions may be relaxed to allow some invalid HTTP/1.1 clients to communicate with the server, but this will reintroduce the possibility of the problems described in this assessment. Note that relaxing the behavior to 'Unsafe' will still not permit raw CTLs other than HTAB (where permitted), but will allow other RFC requirements to not be enforced, such as exactly two SP characters in the request line.

### moderate: apr\_fnmatch flaw leads to mod\_autoindex remote DoS ([CVE-2011-0419](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0419))

A flaw was found in the apr\_fnmatch() function of the bundled APR library. Where mod\_autoindex is enabled, and a directory indexed by mod\_autoindex contained files with sufficiently long names, a remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request which would cause excessive CPU usage. This could be used in a denial of service attack.

Workaround: Setting the 'IgnoreClient' option to the 'IndexOptions' directive disables processing of the client-supplied request query arguments, preventing this attack.

Resolution: Update APR to release 1.4.5 (bundled with httpd 2.2.19) or release 0.9.20 (bundled with httpd 2.0.65)

### low: mod\_cache and mod\_dav DoS ([CVE-2010-1452](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1452))

A flaw was found in the handling of requests by mod\_cache (2.2) and mod\_dav (2.0 and 2.2). A malicious remote attacker could send a carefully crafted request and cause a httpd child process to crash. This crash would only be a denial of service if using the worker MPM. This issue is further mitigated as mod\_dav is only affected by requests that are most likely to be authenticated, and mod\_cache is only affected if the uncommon "CacheIgnoreURLSessionIdentifiers" directive, introduced in version 2.2.14, is used.

### important: Timeout detection flaw (mod\_proxy\_http) ([CVE-2010-2068](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-2068))

An information disclosure flaw was found in mod\_proxy\_http in versions 2.2.9 through 2.2.15, 2.3.4-alpha and 2.3.5-alpha. Under certain timeout conditions, the server could return a response intended for another user. Only Windows, Netware and OS2 operating systems are affected. Only those configurations which trigger the use of proxy worker pools are affected. There was no vulnerability on earlier versions, as proxy pools were not yet introduced.

The simplest workaround is to globally configure;

### important: mod\_isapi module unload flaw ([CVE-2010-0425](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0425))

A flaw was found with within mod\_isapi which would attempt to unload the ISAPI dll when it encountered various error states. This could leave the callbacks in an undefined state and result in a segfault. On Windows platforms using mod\_isapi, a remote attacker could send a malicious request to trigger this issue, and as win32 MPM runs only one process, this would result in a denial of service, and potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

### low: Subrequest handling of request headers (mod\_headers) ([CVE-2010-0434](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-0434))

A flaw in the core subrequest process code was fixed, to always provide a shallow copy of the headers\_in array to the subrequest, instead of a pointer to the parent request's array as it had for requests without request bodies. This meant all modules such as mod\_headers which may manipulate the input headers for a subrequest would poison the parent request in two ways, one by modifying the parent request, which might not be intended, and second by leaving pointers to modified header fields in memory allocated to the subrequest scope, which could be freed before the main request processing was finished, resulting in a segfault or in revealing data from another request on threaded servers, such as the worker or winnt MPMs.

Acknowledgements: We would like to thank Philip Pickett of VMware for reporting and proposing a fix for this issue.

Users;

Please note the following clarification to the APR 1.4.4 release.
```
```

Whether this represents a security flaw to *your* application depends
on untrusted fnmatch patterns being applied to very long name strings,
the default stack size, and the impact of a stack overflow to the app.
