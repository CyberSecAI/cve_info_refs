The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:

CVE-2011-0777

  Use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via vectors related to image loading

CVE-2011-0778

  operations, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
  Policy via unspecified vectors

CVE-2011-0783

  Unspecified vulnerability in Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 allows
  user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via vectors involving a "bad volume setting."

CVE-2011-0983

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle anonymous blocks,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
  unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a "stale pointer."

CVE-2011-0981

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform event handling for
  animations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
  possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors that lead to a
  "stale pointer."

  allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read)
  via unspecified vectors

CVE-2011-0985

  Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly perform process termination
  upon memory exhaustion, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
