  "CVE-2011-0600": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Adobe Reader on Mac OS X. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The flaw exists within the U3D component distributed with the Reader. The application uses the Parent Node count to calculate the size of an allocation. This value is not properly validated and the result of this size calculation can be wrapped to an unexpectedly small and insufficient value. Writes to this newly allocated buffer can be outside the bounds of its allocation. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code under the context of the application.",
    "Root cause": "The U3D component in Adobe Reader uses the Parent Node count to calculate allocation size without proper validation, leading to an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with the privileges of the application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious webpage",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious U3D file or control content of a webpage that contains a malicious U3D object. No special network position is required.",
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is present in the U3D component of Adobe Reader on MacOS X. The issue is due to a lack of proper validation of the Parent Node count which results in integer wrapping, leading to allocation of an insufficient buffer. Exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application."
