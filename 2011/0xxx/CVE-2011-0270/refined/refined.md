Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `nnmRptConfig.exe` CGI application of HP OpenView Network Node Manager.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data when parsing template names, using it as a format specifier during the creation of an error message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Format string vulnerability: The application uses user-controlled input as a format string in an error message context. This can lead to information disclosure, denial of service, or, in this case, arbitrary code execution.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application doesn't validate or sanitize the template name before using it in a format string operation.
- Unauthenticated access: The vulnerable CGI application is accessible via the web server without requiring authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the user running the web server.
- Complete compromise of the system: This could allow the attacker to gain full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The vulnerability is exposed via the web server on TCP port 80.
- Specifically crafted template name: The attacker needs to send a specially crafted, invalid template name to the vulnerable CGI application (`nnmRptConfig.exe`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote access to the vulnerable web server.
- Ability to send HTTP requests with a crafted, invalid template name to the vulnerable CGI application.
- No prior authentication required.
