The provided content is related to CVE-2011-0347.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was discovered using a DOM fuzzer called `cross_fuzz`. This fuzzer dynamically generates long sequences of DOM operations across multiple documents, inspecting returned objects, recursing into them, and creating circular node references to stress-test garbage collection mechanisms. The fuzzer operates by:
1. Opening two windows with DOM-enabled documents.
2. Crawling the DOM of the first document, collecting object references.
3. Randomly tweaking object properties using previously collected references or hardcoded "interesting" values.
4. Randomly calling object methods, using collected references or hardcoded values for parameters.
5. Destroying the first document, toggling garbage collection.
6. Performing the same crawl and tweak operations on the second document, using references from the first.
7. Randomly destroying the document windows.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The fuzzer revealed "security-relevant GUI corruption issues" in Internet Explorer, specifically on Windows XP. These issues are triggered by cross-document DOM manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of the vulnerability leads to security-relevant GUI corruption issues.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of the DOM in multiple documents using JavaScript, potentially from different windows/frames.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within a browser environment. The attacker does not need to be in a privileged network position or have physical access to the target machine.
