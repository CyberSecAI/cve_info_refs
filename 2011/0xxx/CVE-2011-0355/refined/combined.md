##### 3. Problem Description

a. Cisco Nexus 1000V Virtual Ethernet Module denial of service
The Cisco Nexus 1000V Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM) is a virtual switch for ESX and ESXi. This switch can be added to ESX and ESXi where it replaces the VMware virtual switch and runs as part of the ESX and ESXi kernel.

A flaw in the handling of dropped packets by Cisco Nexus 1000V VEM can cause ESX and ESXi to crash.

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name CVE-2011-0355 to the issue.

The issue is addressed by Cisco in the following releases:

* Cisco Nexus 1000V Virtual Ethernet Module Release 4.2(4) SV1(4)
* Cisco Nexus 1000V Virtual Ethernet Module Release 4.0(4) SV1(3c)

For details refer to the release notes of these releases (see section 4 for links).

VMware customers are only affected by this vulnerability if they have chosen to deploy the Cisco Nexus 1000V virtual switch as a replacement for the VMware vNetwork Standard Switch or the VMware vNetwork Distributed Switch.

VMware has confirmed that the VMware vNetwork Standard Switch and the VMware vNetwork Distributed Switch are not affected by the vulnerability.

The issue is documented by Cisco in Cisco bug ID CSCtj17451 (see section 5 for a link).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

> ## Introduction
>
> The Cisco Nexus 1000V provides a distributed, layer 2 virtual switch that extends across many virtualized hosts. The Cisco Nexus 1000V manages a data center defined by the vCenter Server. Each server in the data center is represented as a line card in Cisco Nexus 1000V and can be managed as if it were a line card in a physical Cisco switch.
>
> Cisco Nexus 1000V consists of the following two components:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM), which contains the Cisco CLI, configuration, and high-level features.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM), which acts as a line card and runs in each virtualized server to handle packet forwarding and other localized functions.
>
>
>
> ## Software Compatibility
>
> The servers that run the Cisco Nexus 1000V VSM and VEM must be in the VMware Hardware Compatibility list. This is a requirement for running the ESX 4.0 software.
>
> For additional compatibility information, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Compatibility Information, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3c)*.
>
>
>
> ## New and Changed Information

> ### Vmotion of VSM
>
> Vmotion of VSM has the following limitations and restrictions:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Vmotion of a VSM is supported for both the active and standby VSM VMs. For high availability, it is recommended that the active VSM and standby VSM reside on separate hosts. To achieve this, and prevent a host failure resulting in the loss of both the active and standby VSM, it is recommended that distributed resource scheduling (DRS) be disabled for both the active and standby VSMs.
>
> If you do not disable DRS, then you must use the VMware anti-affinity rules to ensure that the two virtual machines are never on the same host, and that a host failure cannot result in the loss of both the active and standby VSM.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)VMware Vmotion does not complete when using an open virtual appliance (OVA) VSM deployment if the ISO is still mounted. To complete the Vmotion, either click **Edit Settings** on the VM to disconnect the mounted ISO, or power off the VM. No functional impact results from this limitation.
>
>
> ### VMware 4.0 to 4.1 Online Bundle Missing From Online Portal
>
> The software package for upgrading from VMware 4.0 to 4.1 is not available from the VMware online portal. For this reason, VUM does not automatically download the VIB from the VMware online portal. To upgrade from VMware 4.0 to 4.1, you must first import the offline bundle (ESX 4.1 and Cisco Nexus 1000V VIB) into VUM.
>
>
>
> ### VMware Lab Manager
>
> VMware Lab Manager does not support using the Cisco Nexus 1000V.
>
>
>
> ### Virtual Service Domain
>
> The Virtual Service Domain (VSD) has the following limitations and restrictions:

>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)To prevent it from flooding the network with packets, make sure to configure the inside or outside VSD port profile with a service port.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)To prevent loops in the network, when making any changes to the SVM port profile, do the following:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)First shut down the SVM.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Make the changes to the SVM port profile.

> ### Upgrade
>
> Upgrading the software has the following limitations and restrictions:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)After the VSM feature support level is upgraded to support features in the new release, you cannot downgrade it again to a previous release.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Connectivity to the VSM can be lost during a VEM upgrade when the VSM VM interfaces connect to its own DVS.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Connectivity between the active and standby VSM can be lost during a VEM upgrade when the VEM that is being upgraded provides interface connectivity to one of the VSMs in the pair. In this case, both VSMs become active and lose connectivity. Use the following workaround:
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Power off the VSM that is connected to the VEM.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Manually upgrade the VEM that provides interface connectivity to one VSM in the pair.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you use a proxy server to connect VMware Update Manager (VUM) to the Internet, you may need to disable the proxy before starting a VUM upgrade of your VEMs. In the VMware versions before VUM Update 1, the proxy prevents VUM from communicating locally with the VSM. Automatic VEM upgrades may fail if the proxy is not disabled first.
>
> For more information about upgrades, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Software Upgrade Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3c)*.

>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The cache size that is configured using the CLI defines the number of entries, not the size in bytes. The configured entries are allocated for each processor in the ESX host and the total memory allocated depends on the number of processors.
>

>
>
>
>
> ### Port Security
>
> Port security has the following support, limitations, and restrictions:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Port security is enabled globally by default.
> The **feature/no feature port-security** command is not supported.

>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If you attempt to remove a port profile that is in use, that is, one that has already been auto-assigned to an interface, the Cisco Nexus 1000V generates an error message and does not allow the removal.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When you remove a port profile that is mapped to a VMware port group, the associated port group and settings within the vCenter Server are also removed.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Policy names are not checked against the policy database when ACL/NetFlow policies are applied through the port profile. It is possible to apply a nonexistent policy.
>
>
>
> ### Telnet Enabled by Default
>
> The Telnet server is enabled by default.
>
> For more information about Telnet, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Security Configuration Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
>
>
>
> ### SSH Support
>
> Only SSH version 2 (SSHv2) is supported.

>
> For more information about Layer 2 switching, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
>
>
>
> ### No Spanning Tree Protocol
>
> The Cisco Nexus 1000V forwarding logic is designed to prevent network loops so it does not need to use the Spanning Tree Protocol. Packets that are received from the network on any link connecting the host to the network are not forwarded back to the network by the Cisco Nexus 1000V.
>
>
>
>
> ### MAC Address Table
>
> In the MAC address table, the forwarding table for each VLAN in a VEM can store up to 1024 MAC addresses.
>
> For more information about the Cisco Nexus 1000V MAC address table, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
>
>
>
> ### Maximum Allowed VLANs and MAC Addresses per VLAN
>
> [Table 1-2](#wp56137) lists the allowable number of VLANs and MAC addresses per VLAN that can be configured.
>
>
>
> Table 1-2 Allowable VLANs and MAC Addresses Per VLAN
>
>
> | Feature | Maximum Limit |
> | --- | --- |
> | VLANs across all VEMs | 512 |
> | MAC addresses per VLAN within a VEM | 1024 (1K) |
>
>
>
>
> For more information about the Cisco Nexus 1000V VLAN configuration, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Layer 2 Switching Configuration Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
>
>
>
> ### Cisco Discovery Protocol
>
> The Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is enabled globally by default.
>
> CDP runs on all Cisco-manufactured equipment over the data link layer and does the following:
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Advertises information to all attached Cisco devices.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Discovers and views information about those Cisco devices.
>
> –![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)CDP can discover up to 256 neighbors per port if the port is connected to a hub with 256 connections.
>
> If disabled globally, then CDP is also disabled for all interfaces.
>
> For more information about the Cisco Discovery Protocol, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V System Management Configuration Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
>
>
>
> ### DHCP Not Supported for the Management IP
>
> DHCP is not supported for the management IP. The management IP must be configured statically.
>
>
>
> ### LACP
>
> The Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) is an IEEE standard protocol that aggregates Ethernet links into an EtherChannel.
>
> Cisco Nexus 1000V has the following restrictions for enabling LACP on ports carrying the Control and Packet VLANs:
>
> ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)
>
> ---
>
>
> **Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)These restrictions do not apply to other data ports using LACP.
>
> ---
>
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)At least two ports must be configured as part of the LACP channel.
>
> •![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The upstream switch ports must be configured in spanning-tree portfast mode. The LACP negotiation causes upstream switch ports to bounce, as per protocol, before starting the port aggregation process.
>
> Without spanning-tree portfast on upstream switch ports, it takes approximately 30 seconds to recover these ports on the upstream switch. Because these ports are carrying control and packet VLANs, VSM loses connectivity to the VEM.
>
> The following commands are available to use on Cisco upstream switch ports in interface configuration mode:
>
> **spanning-tree portfast**
>
> **spanning-tree portfast trunk**
>
> **spanning-tree portfast edge trunk**
>
>
>
> ### MTU Mismatch After ESX Reboot
>
> If you use an MTU other than 1500 (the default) for a physical NIC attached to the Cisco Nexus 1000V, then reboots of the ESX can result in a mismatch with the VMware kernel NIC and failure of the VSM and VEM. For example, in networks that use jumbo frames, you may manually configure an MTU of other than 1500. During a power cycle, the ESX reboots and the MTU of the physical NIC reverts to the default of 1500 but the VMware kernel NIC does not. To prevent this mismatch and preserve the MTU for the physical NIC across reboots of the ESX, you must configure the system MTU in the system port profile.
>
> For information about configuring MTU in the system port profile, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Port Profile Configuration Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
>
> For information about recovering from a loss of connectivity due to an MTU mismatch, see the *Cisco Nexus 1000V Troubleshooting Guide, Release 4.0(4)SV1(3)*.
