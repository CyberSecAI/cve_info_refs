## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Layout: Images, Video, and HTML Frames
▾

Core :: Layout: Images, Video, and HTML Frames

Issues with the CSS images and other replaced content. This includes loading, layout, and rendering of CSS images (such as in background-image), and the layout of HTML img, picture, video, iframe, frame, and frameset elements. For issues with image decoding and video playback, see the ImageLib and Audio/Video components respectively.

Example bugs:

* SVG as image with an intrinsic width and max-height has its width incorrectly scaled down by the same ratio as the height is scaled down
* <iframe> has incorrect default size in vertical writing mode

Specifications covered:

* CSS Backgrounds
* CSS Images

When creating a frameset element both a rows and cols spec are parsed by nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol, which limits their sizes to 100'000 elements.
If a frameset spec is created where the product of the rows and cols sizes is >= 2^32 we overflow the PRInt32 numCells:
layout/generic/nsFrameSetFrame.cpp
352 PRInt32 numCells = mNumRows\*mNumCols;
369 mChildFrameborder = new nsFrameborder[numCells];
With carefully crafted values for the rows and cols spec this can lead to arbitrary code execution on some platforms.

Analysis:
The POC creates a frameset with 61751 rows and 69553 cols, which overflows to allocate memory for 7 frames.
nsHTMLFramesetFrame::Init uses this 7 value throughout and I can't find any opportunity for a heap overflow there, but nsHTMLFramesetFrame::SetBorderResize uses the mNumRows and mNumCols values to iterate through the cells.
(PRInt32 childX = aBorderFrame->mPrevNeighbor + (rowX \* mNumCols);)
It passes the computed index to nsHTMLFramesetFrame::CanChildResize, which calls nsFrameList::FrameAt(PRInt32 aIndex) with the out of bounds index:
276 nsFrameList::FrameAt(PRInt32 aIndex) const
277 {
278 NS\_PRECONDITION(aIndex >= 0, "invalid arg");
279 if (aIndex < 0) return nsnull;
280 nsIFrame\* frame = mFirstChild;
281 while ((aIndex-- > 0) && frame) {
282 frame = frame->GetNextSibling();
283 }
284 return frame;
This will walk off the end of the list and return NULL.
This is then passed to nsHTMLFramesetFrame::GetNoResize without checking for NULL. GetNoResize also performs no NULL check on the pointer it is passed before executing:
1359 nsIContent\* content = aChildFrame->GetContent();
(where aChildFrame is a NULL pointer)
If you can map the null page (eg: an older version of linux, not sure about other systems) you could heap spray hoping to control memory just above 0x00000000 to gain control of execution flow.
There may be a more elegant heap overflow possible using the integer overflow but I haven't found one.
The fix would be to limit the size of frameset specs to something way below 100'000, and a null check on the return value of nsFrameList::FrameAt.

I don't see how this could be other than a null deref, and we're generally less worried about old systems that let you map memory at null since so many things fall down in that case.
What insane pages are going to break if we limited framesets to 10x10, 100x100, or 250x250? or even 1024x1024? We don't need to allow framesets with 10 billion frames.blocking1.9.1: ? → ---blocking1.9.2: ? → ---blocking2.0: ? → ---Keywords: [crash](/buglist.cgi?keywords=crash&resolution=---),

Exploiting that particular code path I agree does require the ability to map the null page which really should be stopped by the OS.
However I still think this is exploitable; for example using the method outline in the report for [bug 576447](/show_bug.cgi?id=576447 "RESOLVED FIXED - FRAMESET integer overflow via new operator in nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol()") where the overflow actually happens in the new[] allocator.
Crafting new frameset specs with smaller sizes (eg 2^16) leads to this style of overflow and a different AV/crash.
I will attach a new POC showing this.

This POC just sets mNumRows and mNumCols to 2^16+1 instead, which segfaults inside nsHTMLFramesetFrame::Init
With more carefully chosen values than these for mNumCols and mNumRows (taking into account the sizes of the array elements being allocated) it should be possible to control the overflow more carefully such that a heap overflow is possible.
I will do some more work on it an attach better POC + trace tomorrow.

As per the method used for [bug 576447](/show_bug.cgi?id=576447 "RESOLVED FIXED - FRAMESET integer overflow via new operator in nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol()"), this now sets the rows to 3078 and the cols to 87211. This leads to the correct value being computed for numCells and to the correct allocations of mChildTypes and mChildFrameborder (which both have sizes of 4 bytes.)
However, when allocating:
370 mChildBorderColors = new nsBorderColor[numCells];
the size of struct nsBorderColor is 16 bytes, which leads to an allocation of 16\*87211\*3078 mod 2^32 == 32 bytes.
nsBorderColor is defined as:
64 struct nsBorderColor
65 {
66 nscolor mLeft;
67 nscolor mRight;
68 nscolor mTop;
69 nscolor mBottom;
70
71 nsBorderColor() { Set(NO\_COLOR); }
72 ~nsBorderColor() {}
73 void Set(nscolor aColor) { mLeft = mRight = mTop = mBottom = aColor; }
74 };
so the constructor is called for numCells elements in the array (where numCells == 87211\*3078) leading to a heap overflow, which with more work could be more controlled leading to arbitrary code execution.
I've changed the whiteboard back to [sg:critical?] since this shows that the vuln can lead to more than just a null deref.
I'm very new to the firefox dev environment, if the decision as to whether it's critical or not isn't mine to make then please change it back!Whiteboard: [sg:dos?] → [sg:critical?]

This fix changes the maximum number of frameset rows and cols to 100. It adds PR\_STATIC\_ASSERT's to check that overflows don't occur during the allocations. These assert's cause compile time failures when using the original value of 100000 for the maximum value.

Um... there are some really old bugs in which they were complaining about our 5000-frame-total cap on frame trees and the like... (And it might not have been Lotus, though I think it was. It was \_definitely\_ something IBM.) I could dig up the bug numbers if that would really help, I guess.

This patch allows 100 frames in each direction. Nested framesets could easily take the total number of frames over 5000 if people wanted that. The question is whether people need more than 100 rows or columns in a single frameset.

+ // Maximum value of mNumRows and mNumCols is NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT
+ PR\_STATIC\_ASSERT(NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT < UINT\_MAX / sizeof(nscoord));
mRowSizes = new nscoord[mNumRows];
I don't think we actually need these asserts where we're not doing multiplication ourselves. I assume that the implementation of 'new' will avoid overflow when it internally multiplies by sizeof(nscoord) etc.
+ PR\_STATIC\_ASSERT(NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT < UINT\_MAX / sizeof(PRInt32));
Here I guess we should be asserting that NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT < PR\_INT32\_MAX/NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT.
+ // Ensure we can't overflow numCells
+ PR\_STATIC\_ASSERT(NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT \* NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT < PR\_INT32\_MAX);
Same here. I don't think there's a guarantee that the compiler's calculations won't overflow...

Maybe instead of capping NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT we should just check that memory allocation calculations don't overflow, and move on. Or set the limit to something ridiculously high like 16000.
As for the test, we can try create a frameset which is 20,000 x 1 and see if we get the number of frames we expect.

Unfortunately I don't think we can trust the implementation. See [bug 466445](/show_bug.cgi?id=466445 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - |new []| can integer-overflow with gcc (g++)") and [bug 576447](/show_bug.cgi?id=576447 "RESOLVED FIXED - FRAMESET integer overflow via new operator in nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol()") for an example of it in practice.

Fix for mozilla-central
Requesting approval to land on 1.9.2 and 1.9.1. The patch has baked on mozilla-central for about a week without issues. The patch has no performance issues.
The oly backwards compatibility issue I can think of is that we've lowered the number of frames that a frameset can have to 16,000. Frames with more than this number previously would allocate enormous amounts of memory, or crash and hit the error described in this bug so I don't see this as a risk.
Tests were not included on discussion with roc as the tests that could trigger the error case allocated many gigabytes of memory making it problematic to run.

I notice that this still crashes 3.6.14, released a couple of days ago.
(at least on the Ubuntu 10.10 3.6.14 packages which went out today)
Should this have been patched in that release?

No, Ian. Read [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=623998#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in frameset spec (not bug 576447) w/gcc compiler"). This is approved for 1.9.2.15 (which will be 1.9.2.16 as of this morning). This was not fixed in 1.9.2.14 or 3.6.14.

You're right, sorry. I'd just upgraded the ubuntu package, ran some quick tests and saw this crash. I hadn't read that comment properly, my bad.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

|  | |

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: 3.6.13
When parsing MIME types (for example the "text/javascript" here: <script type="text/javascript">...) the following code in netwerk/mime/src/nsMIMEHeaderParamImpl.cpp is called:
function nsMIMEHeaderParamImpl::GetParameterInternal
158 // aParamName is empty. return the first (possibly) \_unnamed\_ 'parameter'
159 // For instance, return 'inline' in the following case:
160 // Content-Disposition: inline; filename=.....
161 if (!aParamName || !\*aParamName)
162 {
163 for (; \*str && \*str != ';' && !nsCRT::IsAsciiSpace(\*str); ++str)
164 ;
165 if (str == start)
166 return NS\_ERROR\_UNEXPECTED;
167 \*aResult = (char \*) nsMemory::Clone(start, (str - start) + 1);
168 (\*aResult)[str - start] = '\0'; // null-terminate
169 NS\_ENSURE\_TRUE(\*aResult, NS\_ERROR\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY);
170 return NS\_OK;
171 }
If the Clone call fails (returning NULL), then a null byte is still written to a controlled arbitrary address (0x0 + (str - start)) (where str-start is the length of the MIME type string.)
The address which could be written to does depend on the size of the string which is required to fail the Clone call, but it's still useably arbitrary (and, importantly, is an absolute address :-) ).
Lack of a mapped null page in modern OSes doesn't stop this, since 0x0 is never dereferenced here but a controlled, suitably large offset from it.
One possible exploitation scenario would be using this vuln to overwrite a refcount somewhere, setting it to 0 allowing a use-after-free.
I don't have a PoC unfortunately, I tried to knock up some suitable heap grooming JS but I couldn't get the right layout to trigger the Clone failing. That's not to say it's not possible!
The following html will hit the line of code though:
<html><head>
<script type="text/javascriptAAAAAAAAAAAA"> </script>
</head><body>x</body></html>
[obviously, you want a MUCH longer run of AAA's :-) ]
Reproducible: Couldn't Reproduce
Steps to Reproduce:
Exhaust memory suitably, document.write() a script tag with a long MIME type

Attached patch

[patch, check for OOM before writing the null terminator](attachment.cgi?id=514026&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=514026&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=635705&attachment=514026)

I don't know how easy it would be to actually create an exploit for this, but the code certainly looks wrong. A simple fix should be to move the check for out-of-memory before the line that writes the null-terminator.

There are locations where stomping a null byte can make all the difference in the world, but with things like ASLR it would seem pretty hard to make a reliable exploit out of this. Especially if you're running close to OOM. Is this really a plausible attack ('critical') or more theoretical ('moderate' or 'low')?Whiteboard: [sg:moderate]

I agree totally that without either a separate address leak bug or the target using a non-ALSR'ed platform reliable exploitation of this sort of bug is unlikely.
Windows XP is still both supported and widely used though :-(
(I've just rebooted an XP vm a couple of times and attached olly to firefox, the stack appears to be at a static base. I don't really know much about windows though, or whether stuff like EMET would help that?)
I'll offer another possible way to leverage this bug to achieve code execution:
Given the base address of the stack, a byte of a function pointer or return address on the stack can be set to 0x00. Successful exploitation would require finding a suitable pivot (or 'ROP gadget' if you want) at such an address such that the instruction sequence at that address was, for example, something like 'sub esp, 0xXX; ret', where 0xXX would move esp into a stack buffer you control. Coupled with a ret-to-lib DEP defeat this would yield arbitrary execution.
I would say that almost all 'critical' memory corruption bugs would still require either an address leak or to be on a non-aslr'ed platform to be turned into a reliable exploit (without a heap spray.)
I'd say this was a critical bug, but it's not my decision :-)

(What is certainly true is that it would be a lot of effort to turn this from the theoretical attack outlined above to a plausible one)

(I might have mis-interpreted your point, sorry, you're also quite right that even triggering this code (getting exactly the right ::Clone call to fail) would be pretty hard too!)

[BUG 443299](/show_bug.cgi?id=443299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate possible buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser") was a pretty similar bug for which a PoC exploit was written though :-)

Inspired by [BUG 443299](/show_bug.cgi?id=443299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate possible buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser") I played a bit more with my heapspraying js and I can now get the clone to fail in a repeatable way :-)
It's not an exploit yet by any means but it does at least show that you can hit this bug. In fact, because it exhausts almost all the address space, in all my tests it doesn't even crash... but watching in gdb you can see the null byte being written to the controlled address.
I'll paste my condensed gdb trace here and attach my PoC, I should point out though that it working first time for someone else in it's current state is unlikely! But I'm happy to work with you to fiddle with the magic numbers/phase of the moon etc to get a confirmation that it actually works for someone else!

You can see that the target address (0x600000f) is mapped (and writable, but info proc mappings doesn't show that) so there isn't a segfault. In fact, at that address there's already a null byte (at least in the four or so times that I tried it) from the unicode version of the heapspray string "BBBBBBB". I wrote 'F' where it's about to write 0x00, stepped to the next line and you can see that a null byte was written there.

firefox security update (RHSA-2011-0471)

Original Release Date: June 27, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-194

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) and
[CVE-2011-0081](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0081.html) to these issues.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
accessible to the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0071](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0071.html) to this issue.

A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
"application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0070](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0070.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0069](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0069.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0067](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0067.html) to this issue.

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0066](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0066.html) and
[CVE-2011-0065](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0065.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1202.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | All | None | See mitigating factors below. | Avaya IQ | 5.x | None | See mitigating factors below. || Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0.x, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0067 CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0071 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081 CVE-2011-1202 | This rated a Low for IQ, MN, MSS, PS, SMGR because no critical system processes or applications are affected This is rated a None for CS1000 and IQ because XULRunner is not used or configured and Firefox is not installed |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0473.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 | These are a low as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-12

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:2.0.1/ 1.9.2.17/ 1.9.1.19)

Announced
April 28, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.19
* Firefox 3.6.17
* Firefox 4.0.1
* SeaMonkey 2.0.14
* Thunderbird 3.1.10

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### Credits

Mozilla developers Boris Zbarsky, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Michael Wu,
Nils, Scoobidiver, and Ted Mielczarek reported memory safety issues which
affected Firefox 4.

                 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, an unbranded
version of the Thunderbird mail/news client.

CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

   "Scoobidiver", Ian Beer Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo,
   Mats Palmgren, Jesse Ruderman, Aki Kelin and Martin Barbella
   discovered memory corruption bugs, which may lead to the execution
   of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0073

   "regenrecht" discovered several dangling pointer vulnerabilities,
   which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0067

   Paul Stone discovered that Java applets could steal information
   from the autocompletion history.

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86\_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: Mozilla Firefox 3.6.13
After appending a frame with a src of "#" to a title element with the NoScript add-on enabled, Firefox will usually crash. This is caused by a read of freed memory. The crash is usually occurring in nsDocShellEnumerator::GetNext(nsISupports\*\*).
I have tested this in Firefox 3.6.13 with NoScript 2.0.9.3 on Ubuntu 10.04 (64 bit) and Windows Vista (32 bit).
Reproducible: Sometimes
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Open the attached testcase, 1.html, in Firefox with the NoScript add-on enabled.
2. If a crash does not occur immediately, either refresh the page a few times, or close the browser. The crash after closing is extremely consistent, but refreshing the page a few times seems to do the trick.
Actual Results:
The browser will either crash after loading the page, or at exit.
Expected Results:
The particular script should be executed as expected, and the browser should not crash.
The html file that produces the crash, a stack trace using gdb, and output from valgrind will be attached after this bug is created. If I discover any other useful information about this bug, I will include it.

Uh.... no. No reason. And if fact, holding raw weak refs there is clearly unsafe. The safe fix here (in terms of not leaking, etc) is probably to use an array of nsWeakPtrs. The next-safer thing is to just make these strong refs and hope. Note that docshell is not CCed.

Possibly -- we use nsDocShellEnumerators in our own code (as do several add-ons in addition to NoScript) and could maybe get into this state. Assuming the worst back to [sg:critical?]Whiteboard: [hardblocker][passed try][needs review] → [sg:critical?][hardblocker][passed try][needs review]

For 1.9.1, it will require more work.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.
