If the Clone call fails (returning NULL), then a null byte is still written to a controlled arbitrary address (0x0 + (str - start)) (where str-start is the length of the MIME type string.)\nThe address which could be written to does depend on the size of the string which is required to fail the Clone call, but it's still useably arbitrary (and, importantly, is an absolute address :-) ).\nLack of a mapped null page in modern OSes doesn't stop this, since 0x0 is never dereferenced here but a controlled, suitably large offset from it.\nOne possible exploitation scenario would be using this vuln to overwrite a refcount somewhere, setting it to 0 allowing a use-after-free.\nThe following html will hit the line of code though:\n<html><head>\n<script type=\"text/javascriptAAAAAAAAAAAA\"> </script>\n</head><body>x</body></html>\n",
