Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-0133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the way WebKit handles floating blocks, specifically when performing layout operations for a floating block produced by a pseudo-element.
*   The application attempts to access glyph data that hasn't been fully assigned into the glyph data hashmap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Glyph Data:** The application tries to access glyph data that is not fully initialized.
*   **Memory Corruption:** Accessing incomplete data can lead to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary code under the context of the application.
*   **Application Termination:** It can also result in unexpected application termination.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a malicious website containing crafted code that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious File:** The vulnerability can be triggered by opening a malicious file.
*   **User interaction is required** - The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by enticing a user to interact with a malicious page or file.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific flaw within WebKit.
*   **Crafted Payload:** The attacker must craft a malicious page or file that can trigger the vulnerability.
