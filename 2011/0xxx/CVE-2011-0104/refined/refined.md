  "CVE-2011-0104": {
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft Excel handles specially crafted Excel files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel encounters a memory handling error during validation of record information while parsing a specially crafted Excel file.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer Overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote Code Execution. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain complete control of the affected system and install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Opening a specially crafted Excel file received via email.",
        "Visiting a website hosting a specially crafted Excel file."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious Excel file and convince a user to open it."
    },
     "affected_software": [
        "Microsoft Excel 2002 Service Pack 3",
        "Microsoft Excel 2003 Service Pack 3",
	"Microsoft Excel 2007 Service Pack 2",
	"Microsoft Excel 2010 (32-bit editions)",
        "Microsoft Excel 2010 (64-bit editions)",
	"Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac",
        "Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac",
        "Open XML File Format Converter for Mac",
	"Microsoft Excel Viewer Service Pack 2",
        "Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats Service Pack 2"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by memory handling error during record validation in a specially crafted file. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited. Microsoft Excel versions 2002 and later have a built-in feature that prompts users before opening a document, which mitigates the severity to 'Important' instead of 'Critical' because the exploit requires more than a single user action to complete.",
    "workarounds": [
      "Use Microsoft Office File Block policy to block the opening of Office 2003 and earlier documents in Microsoft Excel from unknown or untrusted sources and locations.",
      "Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources",
       "Do not open Office files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources."
