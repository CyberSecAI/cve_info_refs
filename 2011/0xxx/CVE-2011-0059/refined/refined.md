Here's the breakdown of the provided content regarding CVE-2011-0059:

**Summary**

The provided documents describe a vulnerability related to how Mozilla Firefox and SeaMonkey handle HTTP 307 redirects in plugins. This vulnerability allows a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack if a plugin sends an HTTP request with custom headers and receives a 307 redirect.

**Root cause of vulnerability**

The root cause is the failure of Firefox and SeaMonkey to notify plugins of HTTP 307 redirects, leading to the browser forwarding the original request (including custom headers) to the new location without plugin awareness.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**

*   **Missing Notification:** Plugins are not informed about HTTP 307 redirects.
*   **Unrestricted Header Forwarding:** Custom headers from the original request are forwarded during a 307 redirect, even if it's cross-origin.
*   **CSRF:** The lack of notification and the forwarding of custom headers allows an attacker to perform CSRF attacks, as custom headers expected only from a same-origin request can be sent cross-origin by the browser.

**Impact of exploitation**

*   **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers can craft malicious requests that force a browser to send custom headers to a target origin, potentially bypassing CSRF protections.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Although not directly stated, the CSRF can lead to a change of state in the target application, and in some cases, this change of state could involve gaining permissions or other access not usually granted.
*   **Potentially arbitrary code execution:** While not direct in this particular vulnerability, there is a possibility that the CSRF attack could lead to arbitrary code execution, depending on the specifics of the application the CSRF attack is targeted against.

**Attack vectors**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker crafts a malicious website to cause plugins to make HTTP requests that trigger a 307 redirect.
*   **Plugin-Initiated Requests:** The attack exploits HTTP requests made by plugins.
*   **307 Redirects:** The server must respond with an HTTP 307 redirect to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**

*   **Ability to control a server:** To serve the 307 redirects
*   **Basic understanding of web requests:** To craft the initial malicious request as well as understanding how 307 redirects operate
*   **Target user interaction:** The user must visit the malicious webpage to trigger the exploit

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Firefox 3.5, 3.6, and SeaMonkey.
*   The fix involved disabling cross-origin 307 redirects for plugin-initiated POST requests and notifying plugins in the case of same-origin redirects after an initial block.
*   The fix was initially deemed to have the potential to break existing content.
*   Initially, a fix was developed that prevented all cross-origin redirects for plugins, but this was deemed too restrictive, and instead, a fix was released that targeted 307 redirects specifically to mitigate CSRF.
