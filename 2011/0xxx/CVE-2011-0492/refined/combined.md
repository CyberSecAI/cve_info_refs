```
Tor 0.2.1.29 continues our recent code security audit work. The main
fix resolves a remote heap overflow vulnerability that can allow remote
code execution. Other fixes address a variety of assert and crash bugs,
most of which we think are hard to exploit remotely.

All Tor users should upgrade.

<https://www.torproject.org/download/download>

Changes in version 0.2.1.29 - 2011-01-15
  o Major bugfixes (security):
    - Fix a heap overflow bug where an adversary could cause heap
      corruption. This bug probably allows remote code execution
      attacks. Reported by "debuger". Fixes CVE-2011-0427. Bugfix on
      0.1.2.10-rc.
    - Prevent a denial-of-service attack by disallowing any
      zlib-compressed data whose compression factor is implausibly
      high. Fixes part of bug 2324; reported by "doorss".
    - Zero out a few more keys in memory before freeing them. Fixes
      bug 2384 and part of bug 2385. These key instances found by
      "cypherpunks", based on Andrew Case's report about being able
      to find sensitive data in Tor's memory space if you have enough
      permissions. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre9.

  o Major bugfixes (crashes):
    - Prevent calls to Libevent from inside Libevent log handlers.
      This had potential to cause a nasty set of crashes, especially
      if running Libevent with debug logging enabled, and running
      Tor with a controller watching for low-severity log messages.
      Bugfix on 0.1.0.2-rc. Fixes bug 2190.
    - Add a check for SIZE_T_MAX to tor_realloc() to try to avoid
      underflow errors there too. Fixes the other part of bug 2324.
    - Fix a bug where we would assert if we ever had a
      cached-descriptors.new file (or another file read directly into
      memory) of exactly SIZE_T_CEILING bytes. Fixes bug 2326; bugfix
      on 0.2.1.25. Found by doorss.
    - Fix some potential asserts and parsing issues with grossly
      malformed router caches. Fixes bug 2352; bugfix on Tor 0.2.1.27.
      Found by doorss.

  o Minor bugfixes (other):
    - Fix a bug with handling misformed replies to reverse DNS lookup
      requests in DNSPort. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha. Related to a
      bug reported by doorss.
    - Fix compilation on mingw when a pthreads compatibility library
      has been installed. (We don't want to use it, so we shouldn't
      be including pthread.h.) Fixes bug 2313; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
    - Fix a bug where we would declare that we had run out of virtual
      addresses when the address space was only half-exhausted. Bugfix
      on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
    - Correctly handle the case where AutomapHostsOnResolve is set but
      no virtual addresses are available. Fixes bug 2328; bugfix on
      0.1.2.1-alpha. Bug found by doorss.
    - Correctly handle wrapping around when we run out of virtual
      address space. Found by cypherpunks, bugfix on 0.2.0.5-alpha.

  o Minor features:
    - Update to the January 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.
    - Introduce output size checks on all of our decryption functions.

  o Build changes:
    - Tor does not build packages correctly with Automake 1.6 and earlier;
      added a check to Makefile.am to make sure that we're building with
      Automake 1.7 or later.
    - The 0.2.1.28 tarball was missing src/common/OpenBSD_malloc_Linux.c
      because we built it with a too-old version of automake. Thus that
      release broke ./configure --enable-openbsd-malloc, which is popular
      among really fast exit relays on Linux.

# carefully crafted cache file sizes can trigger assert

In read\_file\_to\_str() we do

```
  if ((uint64_t)(statbuf.st_size)+1 > SIZE_T_CEILING)
    return NULL;

  string = tor_malloc((size_t)(statbuf.st_size+1));
```

So a remote attacker who can give you a combination of cached blobs such that one of your files becomes exactly SIZE\_T\_CEILING bytes (just 2 gigs on a 32 bit platform) could cause your Tor to consistently assert on start.

The fix is to check >= instead of >.

Reported by doors.

# Organization

The Tor Project is not a horizontal organization but we try to make decisions as democratic as possible. We have a [structure](/tpo/team/-/wikis/work-relationships) where we operate and maintain the different pieces of software in teams. Our teams meet once a week to coordinate work and also meet frequently to coordinate projects. We have a [project manager](/tpo/team/-/wikis/Process/HowProjectManagementAtTheTorProject) that facilitates the coordination and keeps an eye on the roadmaps to get to deadlines on time.

In 2018, the Executive Director at the Tor Project and set the following goals for the next 3 to 5 years, for the organization and its projects:

**A Mature Tor Project (organization)**

* Stable income flows from a diverse funding base
* Diverse and robust organization that meets our needs
* Strong organizational culture focuses on employees and volunteers happiness
* Global brand recognition - Tor means strong privacy

**Full Access (product/projects)**

* Any person on the planet can access the Tor network
* Any person on the planet can use the Tor network to access any websites or services online
* Ensure the Tor network is diverse, healthy, stable, and scalable

~~As of August 2021, we started to implement ~~[~~OKRs~~](/tpo/team/-/wikis/okrs/home)~~ to set goals per team and role and track outcomes and organize the work ahead. Each team lead has setup OKRs with help of their team (you can find them in each team's wiki) as well as Roger for the ~~[~~areas he is working on~~](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/team/-/wikis/arma)~~.~~

# Tor 0.2.1.29 is released (security patches)

by erinn | January 17, 2011

![](../static/images/lead.png)

Tor 0.2.1.29 continues our recent code security audit work. The main

fix resolves a remote heap overflow vulnerability that can allow remote

code execution. Other fixes address a variety of assert and crash bugs,

most of which we think are hard to exploit remotely.

**All Tor users should upgrade.**

Changes in version 0.2.1.29 - 2011-01-15

**Major bugfixes (security):**

* Fix a heap overflow bug where an adversary could cause heap

  corruption. This bug probably allows remote code execution

  attacks. Reported by "debuger". Fixes CVE-2011-0427. Bugfix on

  0.1.2.10-rc.
* Prevent a denial-of-service attack by disallowing any

  zlib-compressed data whose compression factor is implausibly

  high. Fixes part of bug 2324; reported by "doorss".
* Zero out a few more keys in memory before freeing them. Fixes

  bug 2384 and part of bug 2385. These key instances found by

  "cypherpunks", based on Andrew Case's report about being able

  to find sensitive data in Tor's memory space if you have enough

  permissions. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre9.

**Major bugfixes (crashes):**

* Prevent calls to Libevent from inside Libevent log handlers.

  This had potential to cause a nasty set of crashes, especially

  if running Libevent with debug logging enabled, and running

  Tor with a controller watching for low-severity log messages.

  Bugfix on 0.1.0.2-rc. Fixes bug 2190.
* Add a check for SIZE\_T\_MAX to tor\_realloc() to try to avoid

  underflow errors there too. Fixes the other part of bug 2324.
* Fix a bug where we would assert if we ever had a

  cached-descriptors.new file (or another file read directly into

  on 0.2.1.25. Found by doorss.
* Fix some potential asserts and parsing issues with grossly

  malformed router caches. Fixes bug 2352; bugfix on Tor 0.2.1.27.

  Found by doorss.

**Minor bugfixes (other):**

* Fix a bug with handling misformed replies to reverse DNS lookup

  requests in DNSPort. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha. Related to a

  bug reported by doorss.
* Fix compilation on mingw when a pthreads compatibility library

  has been installed. (We don't want to use it, so we shouldn't

  be including pthread.h.) Fixes bug 2313; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
* Fix a bug where we would declare that we had run out of virtual

  addresses when the address space was only half-exhausted. Bugfix

  on 0.1.2.1-alpha.
* Correctly handle the case where AutomapHostsOnResolve is set but

  no virtual addresses are available. Fixes bug 2328; bugfix on

  0.1.2.1-alpha. Bug found by doorss.
* Correctly handle wrapping around when we run out of virtual

  address space. Found by cypherpunks, bugfix on 0.2.0.5-alpha.

**Minor features:**

* Update to the January 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.
* Introduce output size checks on all of our decryption functions.

**Build changes:**

* Tor does not build packages correctly with Automake 1.6 and earlier;

  added a check to Makefile.am to make sure that we're building with

  Automake 1.7 or later.
* The 0.2.1.28 tarball was missing src/common/OpenBSD\_malloc\_Linux.c

  because we built it with a too-old version of automake. Thus that

  release broke ./configure --enable-openbsd-malloc, which is popular

  among really fast exit relays on Linux.
