Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the Password Vault Web Access (PVWA) component of Cyber-Ark Software's Privileged Identity Management Suite.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it in a web page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary scripts into the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of Arbitrary Script: A successful exploit would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the web browser of a logged-in user.
- Potential for Further Attacks: This can lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing user session cookies, potentially compromising the user's account.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.
    - Defacing the website or displaying misleading information

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Input Injection: The attack involves injecting malicious script through a user input that is not properly sanitized by the web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the PVWA web portal.
- User Interaction: While the JVN analysis states "the vulnerability can be exploited without an honest user taking any action", this is likely an error, as the user would have to at least load the web page which contains the malicious script. The Secunia content does not mention the user interaction requirement.
- Access: An administrator must have created a user login to the system.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable input: The attacker needs to identify the specific input where the XSS vulnerability exists.

**Affected Products:**
- PVWA v6.0 releases v6.0 patch #2 and earlier
- PVWA v5.5 releases v5.5 patch #4 and earlier
- PVWA v5.0 and earlier

**Additional details:**
- The JVN analysis notes "the user must be convinced to take a difficult or suspicious action. If the honest user must have elevated privileges, they are likely to be more suspicious". This seems like an error because a successful XSS attack does not generally rely on a user taking suspicious action to trigger it, and this claim contradicts the JVN claim that the vulnerability can be exploited without user action.
