Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0430:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   A double free vulnerability was discovered in the Rx server process of OpenAFS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Double free: The same memory location is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (DoS): The double free can cause the Rx server process to crash.
*   Arbitrary code execution: In some cases, the memory corruption caused by the double free can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is in the Rx server process, suggesting a network-based attack vector. An attacker could send crafted requests to the Rx server to trigger the double free.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable Rx server process.
*   The attacker needs to craft a request that triggers the double free vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided Debian Security Advisory (DSA 2168-1) confirms the vulnerability and provides fixed versions of the OpenAFS package.
*   The advisory indicates that the security update requires rebuilding the OpenAFS kernel module.
*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Andrew Deason.
*   This vulnerability is present in the distributed filesystem AFS (OpenAFS).
