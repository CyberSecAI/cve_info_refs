Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the InduSoft ISSymbol ActiveX control. This occurs due to boundary errors when processing the "InternationalOrder" and "InternationalSeparator" properties of the control.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)
- Improper handling of string lengths when setting properties.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system. This could lead to:
- Adverse application conditions
- Impact on the production environment where the SCADA system is being used.
- Complete compromise of the system by gaining remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Exploitation is achieved by providing an overly long string to the "InternationalOrder" and "InternationalSeparator" properties of the vulnerable ActiveX control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not require authentication
- The attacker needs to be able to send the malicious string to an application using the vulnerable ActiveX control.
- Moderate skill level is required to craft the exploit.

**Additional Details:**
- The affected products include: InduSoft ISSymbol ActiveX Control (Build 301.1009.2904.0), InduSoft Thin Client Version 7.0, and InduSoft Web Studio Version 7.0B2.
-  A CVSS v2 base score of 7.5 is assigned with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).
- No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability, but it can be exploited remotely.

**Mitigation:**
- Apply hotfix 70.1.02.12, which is available from InduSoft support.
- Minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Critical devices should not directly face the Internet.
- Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
- When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
