Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0537:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `Language::factory()` function within MediaWiki. This function, when called with unvalidated user input, allows for path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Script Inclusion:** By manipulating the input to `Language::factory()`, an attacker can include and execute arbitrary PHP scripts present on the local file system.
- **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input to the `Language::factory()` function allowing for file path manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Server Compromise:**  Successful exploitation could lead to complete server compromise due to the execution of arbitrary PHP code.
- **Account Compromise:** Although not directly related to the script inclusion vulnerability, the disclosure mentions a separate CSS injection vulnerability (CVE-2011-0047) that could lead to the compromise of user accounts on Internet Explorer and similar browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling `Language::factory()` with unvalidated user-supplied input.
- The vulnerability is triggered when handling language code, in functions such as `Language::factory`.
- The vulnerability is primarily present on Microsoft Windows servers due to the way `file_exists()` is implemented, but it's also possibly present on Novell Netware. UNIX-based operating systems like Linux and Mac OS X are not affected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the user input that reaches `Language::factory()`.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of a PHP script on the server they can exploit (e.g. via another vulnerability).
- The attacker needs access to the server either remotely, or through an additional attack vector if code execution is only possible locally.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected versions are MediaWiki 1.8.0 and later.
- The vulnerability requires an existing PHP script on the server which has a name ending with `.php`. The file must also be on the same drive as the MediaWiki installation.
- The vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that most PHP files within MediaWiki do not execute arbitrary code without explicit actions.
- Exploitation requires a further vulnerability or method to get a PHP script onto the server in the first place.
- A fix is released in MediaWiki 1.16.2, which introduces input validation through `Language::isValidCode()` and throws exceptions upon invalid input to `Language::factory()`.
- Extension developers should validate input language codes by using `Language::isValidCode()` or checking against the list returned by `Language::getLanguageNames()`.
