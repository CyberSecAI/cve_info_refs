{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overflow in the handling of a specific image format within Universal 3D (U3D) compressed files. The application allocates a buffer based on one size but then proceeds to decompress the data into that buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to the overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the target system under the context of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious U3D file or control a web page that serves such a file. User interaction is required in the form of the user opening the file or visiting the web page.",
     "affected_products": [
          "Adobe Acrobat Reader"
     ]
