{
  "CVE-2011-0017": {
    "Description": "Missing error handling for the setuid/setgid system calls allowed the Debian-exim user to cause root to append log data to arbitrary files.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of error handling in the setuid/setgid system calls within Exim's logging mechanism.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient error handling",
        "Improper privilege management",
        "Unrestricted log file manipulation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker with 'Debian-exim' user privileges could leverage this vulnerability to gain root privileges by appending log data to arbitrary files, potentially leading to complete system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access and privileges of the 'Debian-exim' user.",
      "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is specific to Linux systems and allows for privilege escalation from the exim run-time user to root. The issue was resolved in Exim version 4.74 by correcting the handling of setuid/setgid calls and ensuring proper error handling."
