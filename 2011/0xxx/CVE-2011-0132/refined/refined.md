Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect memory management within the WebKit library when handling run-in elements in CSS. Specifically, during the promotion of a run-in element, the application improperly frees a child element. This creates a dangling reference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. The application frees memory associated with a child element, but later attempts to access that freed memory, leading to a dangling pointer dereference.
- **Incorrect Memory Management:** The underlying cause is improper memory management within WebKit's implementation of the CSS run-in box model.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the application using WebKit (e.g., Safari).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker.
- **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to serve or provide a crafted HTML page or file that triggers the vulnerable code path in WebKit. This could be achieved by hosting a malicious website or sending a malicious file as an email attachment.
- No specific network position is mentioned other than the requirement to deliver the malicious content to the victim.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "wushi of team509 working with TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative."
- Apple has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The advisory indicates that this is a remote code execution vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists within the way WebKit library implements the requirements for a Runin box as outlined in the Visual Formatting Model listed in the CSS 2.1 Specification.
