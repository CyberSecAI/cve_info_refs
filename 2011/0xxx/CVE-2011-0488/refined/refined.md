 Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow in the test web server bundled with Advantech Studio.
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The test web server's stack buffer has a fixed size, and writing more than 2048 bytes to it causes a buffer overflow.
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - Memory corruption leading to potential arbitrary code execution.
 - Service crash.
 

 Attack vectors: Sending a request larger than 2048 bytes to the vulnerable web server.
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable web server. No specific user level privileges are mentioned.
 

 Additional details:
 - The vulnerability is present in Advantech Studio Version 6.1 and all previous versions.
 - The bundled web server is intended for testing purposes only, not for production applications.
 - Advantech recommends migrating to Microsoft IIS for production environments.
 - The vulnerability does not apply to Windows CE platforms.
 - Mitigation includes applying the provided patch, minimizing network exposure, using firewalls, and using VPNs for remote access.

 Root cause of vulnerability: Stack-based buffer overflow in InduSoft NTWebServer web service.
 

 Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The InduSoft NTWebServer test web service has a fixed-size stack buffer, and writing more than 2048 bytes to this buffer causes a stack-based buffer overflow.
 

 Impact of exploitation:
 - The service may crash.
 - An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code.
 

 Attack vectors: Sending a request greater than 2048 bytes to the test web service.
 

 Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service.
 

 Additional details:
 - The vulnerable service runs on port 80/tcp.
 - InduSoft recommends using Microsoft IIS for production and the NTWebServer for development purposes only.
 - Mitigation includes using firewall rules to restrict access to port 80/tcp.
 - The vendor website indicates other devices using the NTWebServer may also be vulnerable.
 - The vulnerability was reported by Jeremy Brown to ICS-CERT.
