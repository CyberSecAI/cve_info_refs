How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Advantech Studio Test Web Server Buffer Overflow
Dear Advantech Studio Customer-
This notice is to inform you that the ICS-CERT (Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team) received a report from independent security researcher, Jeremy Brown, revealing a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the test web server bundled with Advantech Studio Version 6.1 and all previous versions. The Advantech Studio bundled test web server is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when more than 2048 bytes are written to the fixed-size stack buffer. When sending a request greater than 2048 bytes, the web server writes past the bounds of the buffer and corrupts memory, allowing execution of arbitrary code.Advantech has verified the vulnerability and has developed a patch to mitigate the issue. Please download the patch by clicking on the"Download Patch" button to the right.Both ICS-CERT and Advantech recommend that users of Advantech Studio install the patch and minimize network exposure for all control system devices. Control system devices should not directly face the Internet. Control system networks and devices should be located behind firewalls, and be isolated from the business network. If remote access is required, secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) should be utilized.Furthermore, Advantech recommends that users migrate to Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) because the Advantech Studio bundled web server is not intended for production applications, but only as a testing platform.This vulnerability does not apply to Windows CE platforms.
�
\*\*\*Please note: the bundled web server is intended to be used for testing purposes only. If the bundled web server is not used in production, the impact of this vulnerability should be minimal. The ICS-CERT and Advantech recommends that all organizations evaluate the impact of this vulnerability based on their environment, architecture, and product implementation. While a successful exploit of the buffer overflow could allow arbitrary code execution, the specific impact to an individual organization depends on many factors that are unique to the organization.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## InduSoft NTWebServer web service stack-based buffer overflow

#### Vulnerability Note VU#506864

Original Release Date: 2011-01-12 | Last Revised: 2011-01-12

---

### Overview

InduSoft NTWebServer web service contains a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.

### Description

| According to InduSoft's [website](http://www.indusoft.com/indusoftart.php?catid=1&name=IWS/webstudio): "*InduSoft Web Studio™ is a powerful collection of automation tools that provide all the automation building blocks to develop HMIs, SCADA systems and embedded instrumentation solutions. Utilize InduSoft integrated Web technologies to take advantage of Internet/intranet connectivity.*" InduSoft NTWebServer runs a test web service on port 80/tcp. InduSoft NTWebServer test web service is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when more than 2048 bytes are written to the fixed-size stack buffer causing the test web service to write past the bounds of the buffer and corrupt the memory. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker can cause the service to crash and may be able to execute arbitrary code. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Use IIS**  InduSoft [recommends](http://www.indusoft.com/blog/?p=337) using NTWebServer test web service only for development purposes and Microsoft IIS for production. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Enable firewall rules to restrict access for port 80/tcp to only trusted sources. |
| --- |

### Vendor Information

| InduSoft's [website](http://www.indusoft.com/mainpage.php?aricleid=17&type=Certified/Hardware) lists other devices that may be using NTWebServer test web service that may also be vulnerable. |
