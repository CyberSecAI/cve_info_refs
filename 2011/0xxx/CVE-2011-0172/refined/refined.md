- **Root cause:** A divide-by-zero error existed in the handling of Wi-Fi frames within the AirPort component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Divide-by-zero vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker on the same Wi-Fi network can cause a system reset (denial of service).
- **Attack vectors:** Over-the-air by sending specially crafted Wi-Fi frames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target.
