  "CVE-2011-0101": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel encounters a memory handling error during validation of record information while parsing a specially crafted Excel file, corrupting system memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code. Specifically, the flaw exists within the methods used for RealTimeData Record Parsing. When handling a stTopic field that has a bit set specifying double byte characters in the following field, the value of a global pointer is improperly calculated. This pointer is later used in a memcpy operation whose source is user supplied data.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory handling error during validation of record information",
      "Improper calculation of a global pointer",
      "Use of this pointer in a memcpy operation with user-supplied data."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the logged-on user, potentially gaining complete control of the affected system. This can result in the ability to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Email: Sending a specially crafted Excel file to the user and convincing the user to open it.",
      "Web-based: Hosting a website containing a malicious Excel file that attempts to exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted Excel file to a user and convince the user to open it. The attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link that takes them to the attacker's site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted Excel file. No authentication is needed."
