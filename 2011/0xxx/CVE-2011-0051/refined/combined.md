# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-02

## Recursive eval call causes confirm dialogs to evaluate to true

Announced
March 1, 2011
Reporter
Zach Hoffman
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.17
* Firefox 3.6.14
* SeaMonkey 2.0.12

### Description

Security researcher **Zach Hoffman** reported that a
recursive call to `eval()` wrapped in
a `try/catch` statement places the browser into a
inconsistent state. Any dialog box opened in this state is displayed
without text and with non-functioning buttons. Closing the window
causes the dialog to evaluate to true. An attacker could use this
issue to force a user into accepting any dialog, such as one granting
elevated privileges to the page presenting the dialog.

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0313)

Original Release Date: March 2, 2011

Last Revised: March 2, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-064

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled dialog boxes. An attacker
could use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a
blank dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the
dialog box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page
elevated privileges. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0051](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0051.html) to this issue.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0053](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0053.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled plug-ins that perform HTTP
requests. If a plug-in performed an HTTP request, and the server sent a 307
redirect response, the plug-in was not notified, and the HTTP request was
forwarded. The forwarded request could contain custom headers, which could
result in a Cross Site Request Forgery attack. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0059](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0059.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0313.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0051 CVE-2011-0053 CVE-2011-0059 | This is a Low as no critical system processess or applications would be affected. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10\_6\_5; en-us) AppleWebKit/533.18.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.2 Safari/533.18.5
Build Identifier: <http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/products/download.html?product=firefox-3.6.12&os=win&lang=en-US>
Obviously, code like eval(a="eval(a)") causes the script to error out. But adding a try/catch block like eval(a="try{eval(a)}catch(b){/\*code here\*/}") lets you catch the "eval'd-out" state and execute code in it. Any dialog box opened in this state instead shows a textless dialog box with two textless buttons, and pressing these buttons does not close this box. Closing the box with the corner "X" button causes input boxes (confirm, onbeforeunload, netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege, etc.) to evaluate to "true".
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
The following code will open a dialog: eval(a="try{eval(a)}catch(b){c=confirm('You will not see this text')}")
Actual Results:
In Windows 7, the only immediate way to close the aforementioned dialog is by pressing the "X" corner button. If the user performs this action, Firefox will proceed as if the user pressed "OK", causing c == true.
Expected Results:
In a normal case, this action is the equivalent of pressing "Cancel", meaning c == false.
See the attachment in the comments for an example that uses this vulnerability for arbitrary code execution.

Because this example uses netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege, an on-the-Web version would be just as dangerous but would probably need to be placed inside a signed script JAR. To avoid this complexity, I'm assuming that you know to run it locally.

On Mac we use "sheets" rather than dialogs -- there is no 'X' to dismiss. You end up unable to switch tabs or do much of anything and must force-quit (arguably better than letting the attack succeed). I expect the attack to succeed on Linux but have not tried it (of course the testcase must be modified).
I tried Minefield on windows and did not get the testcase to work. The dialog never came up and eventually I got a security exception about file:/// trying to get UniversalXPConnect privs. I don't think we changed anything with enablePrivilege so maybe we changed something in the JS engine or DOM that causes the attack to fail (the dialogs return false/cancel when they can't be created?). The attack definitely succeeds on Windows in both 3.5.x and 3.6.x

On 3.6 linux the browser just enters to an endless loop
and gives "JavaScript error: , line 0: too much recursion"
There are no dialogs.

So how do I get the "sheet" on OSX?
I run the test locally, and still just get endless loop or something.
No dialogs, no "sheets".

When I ran the testcase on OSX I saw just the very beginning of the "sheet" which was just a square a few pixels wide right below the location bar. It was window-modal, though, in the sense that my menus were disabled and I couldn't switch to any other tab.

I don't have Windows development setup, and can't reproduce the problem on Linux
and on OSX the problem is not critical if I understand this right.
But here is a patch which might help.
Based on the code and the error I get on Linux this could help.
Anyone willing to try? The fix is for netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege() -like prompts.

OK, this fixes the critical part of the bug.
Similar thing could be added to other dialogs.

What exactly is the patch fixing? eButtonPressed isn't checked by other code, and commonDialog.js's commonDialogOnload() should be initializing it already... Is this bug somehow causing a code path that avoids the initialization?

By the time that we try to call into commonDialog.js, we're already basically out of C stack space to run JS in, so we probably throw trying to even call into that code. However, given what a mess all of the dialog/window code is, we probably lose the fact that we failed to run the JS somewhere and continue on as if we had.

Ah, I guess that makes sense. Mildly surprising there isn't an error being returned back from OpenWindow(), we still use that code path so it would kinda be nice to figure out where the fail is being dropped.
But this workaround seems fine. You could fix all the prompts for free by having nsPromptService::DoDialog() just do aParamBlock->SetInt(eButtonPressed, 1). Unconditionally setting this should be fine. [IE, basically do the initialization commonDialog.js was doing.]

This is total speculation, but I assume that we run JS while loading the XUL for the dialog's window. That would mean that the error actually gets thrown into a nested event loop run by nsWindowWatcher::OpenWindowJSInternal and gets lost there.

I don't think that I'd call this fixed. I verified the problem with 1.9.2.13 and then tried the nightly .14pre build on XP. The PoC's no longer launch calculator after the fix but the browser is still completely unusable. The user winds up with an Internet Security dialog with two blank buttons that cannot be closed. See <http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/8548/screenshot20110104at153.png>.
The only way out is to kill the entire Firefox process. Does a DoS count as fixed? :-)
Loading both of the PoC's on 1.9.1.16, as soon as the user clicks on the "clicky" button, the whole browser loses focus and cannot be closed (I can't see focus going anywhere but the main window cannot get it back). The only solution is to kill the process. No calculator is launched but the browser is unusable. Post-fix on 1.9.1.17pre, the behavior is exactly the same.
This appears to need some more work.

I was fixing the sg:critical part of the bug. The DoS part is something quite different.

So I can call this "verified" for 1.9.2 since calculator doesn't launch?
Pre-fix on 1.9.1, it never launches calculator and the pre and post-fix behavior is the same. I'm not sure what to verify there.

> So I can call this "verified" for 1.9.2 since calculator doesn't launch?
that sounds right once you get to a state like Dan had in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursing the JavaScript eval function over itself eventually causes all dialogs with confirmation to evaluate to \"true\".") where he was able to recreate on 1.9.1 and 2.
and maybe open a new bug for the sg:dos part?

I haven't been able to duplicate Dan's state in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=616659#c4 "RESOLVED FIXED - Recursing the JavaScript eval function over itself eventually causes all dialogs with confirmation to evaluate to \"true\"."). Dan, any comments or suggestions? Have you been able to duplicate it again?

Marking verified for 1.9.2. Since the problem doesn't manifest with the PoC on 1.9.1, I can't verify the fix there.Keywords: [verified1.9.2](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.2&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:critical] → [sg:critical] [qa-ntd-191]

[Testcase 3](attachment.cgi?id=501952)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=501952&action=edit)

Apparently, in 1.9.1 the browser's behavior varies depending on whether any dialogs have been shown during the current session but prior to the attack. This example displays a dialog before continuing, which probably causes it to succeed for the entire 1.9.1 branch.

firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0310)

Original Release Date: April 11, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-093

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox sanitized HTML content in extensions.
If an extension loaded or rendered malicious content using the
ParanoidFragmentSink class, it could fail to safely display the content,
causing Firefox to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the
user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1585](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1585.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled dialog boxes. An attacker could
use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a blank
dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the dialog
box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page elevated
privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0051](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0051.html) to this issue.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0053](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0053.html),
[CVE-2011-0055](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0055.html),
[CVE-2011-0058](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0058.html) and
[CVE-2011-0062](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0062.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox handled malformed JavaScript. A
website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox to execute that
JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0054](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0054.html),
[CVE-2011-0056](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0056.html) and
[CVE-2011-0057](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0057.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0061](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0061.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled plug-ins that perform HTTP
requests. If a plug-in performed an HTTP request, and the server sent a 307
redirect response, the plug-in was not notified, and the HTTP request was
forwarded. The forwarded request could contain custom headers, which could
result in a Cross Site Request Forgery attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0059](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0059.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0310.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | 7.0 and 7.5 | None | See mitigating factors. | | Avaya IQ | 4.0.x through 5.1.x | None | See mitigating factors. | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1 thru 6.1.2 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.3 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-1585 CVE-2011-0051 CVE-2011-0053 CVE-2011-0054 CVE-2011-0055 CVE-2011-0056 CVE-2011-0057 CVE-2011-0058 CVE-2011-0059 CVE-2011-0061 CVE-2011-0062 | These are a Low for MN, MSS, PS, SM and SMGR as it would require non-standrard direct user interaction. There is no risk to IQ and CS1000 as firefox is not installed, only xulrunner. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
