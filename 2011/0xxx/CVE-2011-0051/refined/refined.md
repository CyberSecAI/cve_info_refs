  "CVE-2011-0051": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey and Firefox handled dialog boxes. An attacker could use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a blank dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the dialog box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page elevated privileges.",
    "root_cause": "A recursive call to `eval()` wrapped in a `try/catch` statement places the browser into an inconsistent state. Dialog boxes opened in this state are displayed without text and with non-functioning buttons.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inconsistent browser state",
      "Dialog boxes displayed without text",
      "Dialog box buttons non-functional",
      "Dialog box closing results in 'true' evaluation instead of 'cancel'"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could force a user into accepting any dialog, such as one granting elevated privileges to the page presenting the dialog. Arbitrary code execution via privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious web page",
      "Recursive eval() call within try/catch block",
	  "User interaction to close the dialog box"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious web page with specific JavaScript code."
