  "CVE-2011-0284": {
    "description": "The MIT Kerberos 5 Key Distribution Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to a double-free condition if the Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT) capability is enabled. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A double-free vulnerability exists in the KDC when processing PKINIT requests. The `prepare_error_as` function attempts to decode the e_data field as both preauth data and as typed data. When the e_data contents are typed data, they are converted to preauth data. This conversion can free pointers to the typed data items, leading to a double free when cleaning up preauth data.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Double-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger a double-free event, causing the KDC daemon to crash, leading to a denial of service. While difficult, arbitrary code execution may also be possible.",
      "attack_vector": "A remote attacker can send a crafted request to the KDC with PKINIT enabled to trigger the vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the KDC server and the ability to send specially crafted requests. No authentication is required.",
       "affected_software": "The vulnerability affects the KDC in releases krb5-1.7 and later when configured to respond to PKINIT requests. Additionally, third-party preauthentication plugins that generate TYPED-DATA in the e-data field of a KRB-ERROR message may also be vulnerable."
