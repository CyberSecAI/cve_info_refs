Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0915:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow within the `nrouter.exe` service of IBM Lotus Domino. This occurs when processing a malformed iCalendar meeting request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `nrouter.exe` service copies data from the `name` parameter within the `Content-Type` header of an iCalendar meeting request into a fixed-size stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- **Lack of input validation:** The service does not validate the size of the `name` parameter before copying it to the stack buffer, making it vulnerable to an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with the privileges of the SYSTEM user. This means the attacker gains complete control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network traffic by sending a crafted iCalendar meeting request.
- **Specific Header:** The malicious payload is embedded in the `name` parameter within the `Content-Type` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, unauthenticated attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any authentication or prior access to the system.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is present in IBM Lotus Domino software.
-  The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) advisory provides a CVSS score of 10.0.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by Digital Vaccine filter ID '6320'.
