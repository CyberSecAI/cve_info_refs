# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)
* [2 Contributor mentoring](#Contributor_mentoring)
* [3 Automated Testing](#Automated_Testing)
* [4 Autonag](#Autonag)
* [5 Release Engineering](#Release_Engineering)
* [6 Sheriffing](#Sheriffing)
* [7 Firefox](#Firefox)
* [8 Community reported bugs](#Community_reported_bugs)
* [9 Firefox OS](#Firefox_OS)
* [10 Tor](#Tor)
* [11 Web Compatibility](#Web_Compatibility)
* [12 Scrum Development](#Scrum_Development)
* [13 What does this whiteboard keyword mean?](#What_does_this_whiteboard_keyword_mean?)
## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Why are we running majordomo on dm-mailman01 again? Why can't we just convert the bugzilla lists into mailman lists? This would be a good time for that.

It's a pain to convert the archives, etc. It can be done, one of those things nobody has time for.
I've disabled the web interface for now, no point leaving this open for exploit when we have secured list archives on the box that shouldn't be shared.

Mike: Thanks a bunch for the report, since nobody said it on this bug yet. :)
The distinctions aren't visible a lot to outsiders, but there's (mostly) a different group of people attacking your two bugs. This one affects software running on a Mozilla-operated server, so our server ops team is handling it.
The other bug you filed is on a community-operated machine run by the Bugzilla project, so the guys that take care of that machine for Bugzilla are dealing with it.

This issue has been nominated for a bounty, but it'll be up to the bounty committee to make the final decision on whether this qualifies.

Jason Tibbits (CCed last night) is a former project lead for Majordomo2, the current project lead (Michael Yount) seems to be MIA at the moment (his last-known email address bounces). Got a reply from Jason via email that he's going to look into it. Unfortunately he also pointed out that it's exploitable via all of Majordomo2's interfaces, not just the web (i.e. you can exploit it via email as well).
Send an email to majordomo@bugzilla.org with the following in the body of the email:
help ../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
and guess what it mails back to you...
I just grepped through them, and the only record of an attempt to exploit this is the one I just did to verify it.
For now, I've re-enabled the web interface and hacked out the help command at the object parser level within the backend (it'll tell you the help command doesn't exist now).

How hard would it be to chroot majordomo2 until everything can be moved to mailman (which should still be a priority)?

Probably hard, as postfix has to be able to deliver mail to it, and apache has to interact with it likewise.

FWIW, he committed that upstream, I did a cvs update and it picked up his patch, so I didn't have to apply it manually.

As far as I can recall there were never any actual releases of the code base; just snapshots and CVS. It never really acquired a sufficient number of developers to take off. I still host the CVS server and mailing lists but Michael was essentially the primary developer for the last years of the project and I haven't heard from him in ages.

Actually, Mike: Did you want to make any type of formal advisory for this issue? If you want to send something out to the usual lists (full-disclosure, bugtraq, oss-security, etc.), that would be good. If not, I'll probably send out some type of notification just so people know to upgrade and to make sure no vendors have packaged this.

Most of the people actually using majordomo2 are following the mj2-dev@lists.mj2.org mailing list. It should go there first, I'd imagine.

Attached patch

[Fixed file path scrubbing.](attachment.cgi?id=518705&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=518705&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=628064&attachment=518705)

This bug needs to be reopened. The quick fix just changed how the same exploit can be made. For instance, if I was to try this with the new patch:
./..././..././..././..././..././..././..././.../etc/./rc.local
I'd end up with the following:
../../../../../../../../etc/./rc.local
Obviously, this isn't desirable either, so the patch needs to be changed to use the following regex:
s!(^|/)[./]+/!\1!g
When, when applied, will scrub the string of any sequences of dots and slashes bound by either the start of the string or a slash on the left, and a terminal slash on the right.
The patch attached will fix things. Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to submit it to the MJ2 dev list as it doesn't recognise the .me TLD, but I'll be submitting it there shortly.

Fixed file path scrubbing.
This patch fails to apply to current cvs tip of Majordomo2. Coincidentally, Jason appears to have committed another attempt to fix this 2 days ago, which is what conflicts. He didn't do the same as this patch does though.

It's a pain to convert the archives, etc. It can be done, one of those things nobody has time for.
I've disabled the web interface for now, no point leaving this open for exploit when we have secured list archives on the box that shouldn't be shared.

Mike: Thanks a bunch for the report, since nobody said it on this bug yet. :)
The distinctions aren't visible a lot to outsiders, but there's (mostly) a different group of people attacking your two bugs. This one affects software running on a Mozilla-operated server, so our server ops team is handling it.
The other bug you filed is on a community-operated machine run by the Bugzilla project, so the guys that take care of that machine for Bugzilla are dealing with it.

Jason Tibbits (CCed last night) is a former project lead for Majordomo2, the current project lead (Michael Yount) seems to be MIA at the moment (his last-known email address bounces). Got a reply from Jason via email that he's going to look into it. Unfortunately he also pointed out that it's exploitable via all of Majordomo2's interfaces, not just the web (i.e. you can exploit it via email as well).
Send an email to majordomo@bugzilla.org with the following in the body of the email:
help ../../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
and guess what it mails back to you...
I just grepped through them, and the only record of an attempt to exploit this is the one I just did to verify it.
For now, I've re-enabled the web interface and hacked out the help command at the object parser level within the backend (it'll tell you the help command doesn't exist now).

How hard would it be to chroot majordomo2 until everything can be moved to mailman (which should still be a priority)?

Probably hard, as postfix has to be able to deliver mail to it, and apache has to interact with it likewise.

FWIW, he committed that upstream, I did a cvs update and it picked up his patch, so I didn't have to apply it manually.

As far as I can recall there were never any actual releases of the code base; just snapshots and CVS. It never really acquired a sufficient number of developers to take off. I still host the CVS server and mailing lists but Michael was essentially the primary developer for the last years of the project and I haven't heard from him in ages.

Actually, Mike: Did you want to make any type of formal advisory for this issue? If you want to send something out to the usual lists (full-disclosure, bugtraq, oss-security, etc.), that would be good. If not, I'll probably send out some type of notification just so people know to upgrade and to make sure no vendors have packaged this.

Most of the people actually using majordomo2 are following the mj2-dev@lists.mj2.org mailing list. It should go there first, I'd imagine.

Attached patch

[Fixed file path scrubbing.](attachment.cgi?id=518705&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=518705&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=628064&attachment=518705)

This bug needs to be reopened. The quick fix just changed how the same exploit can be made. For instance, if I was to try this with the new patch:
./..././..././..././..././..././..././..././.../etc/./rc.local
I'd end up with the following:
../../../../../../../../etc/./rc.local
Obviously, this isn't desirable either, so the patch needs to be changed to use the following regex:
s!(^|/)[./]+/!\1!g
When, when applied, will scrub the string of any sequences of dots and slashes bound by either the start of the string or a slash on the left, and a terminal slash on the right.
The patch attached will fix things. Unfortunately, I'm currently unable to submit it to the MJ2 dev list as it doesn't recognise the .me TLD, but I'll be submitting it there shortly.

Fixed file path scrubbing.
This patch fails to apply to current cvs tip of Majordomo2. Coincidentally, Jason appears to have committed another attempt to fix this 2 days ago, which is what conflicts. He didn't do the same as this patch does though.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
