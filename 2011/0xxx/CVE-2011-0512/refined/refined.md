      "source": "www.exploit-db.com_5df03292_20250124_215414.html",
      "root_cause": "The 'team_id' variable is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query in 'team.php'.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or other unauthorized access. As demonstrated in the second POC the attacker can also write php code to the webserver.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP GET request to 'team.php' with a manipulated 'team_id' parameter."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application."
      ],
       "additional_details": "The exploit can bypass PHP-Fusion's GET variable XSS filter by using back-ticks instead of brackets. This allows for the injection of PHP code via `shell_exec()`. The exploit requires that `magic_quotes_gpc` is set to Off."
