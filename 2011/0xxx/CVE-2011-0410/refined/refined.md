{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic Server transmits credential information in plaintext during communication with the CollabNet ScrumWorks Desktop Client.  Additionally, the ScrumWorks Basic Server stores unencrypted client usernames and passwords in its internal database.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cleartext transmission of credentials",
      "Storage of unencrypted credentials"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker could intercept and view the credentials of the active client or all authenticated client's username and password hashes using a packet capturing tool. An attacker with access to the server's database could also retrieve unencrypted credentials.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network packet capture (man-in-the-middle)",
      "Direct access to the server's database"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be positioned to capture network traffic between the CollabNet ScrumWorks Basic Server and the Desktop Client, or have access to the server's database. No specific privileges are mentioned beyond the capability to capture network traffic or access the database."
