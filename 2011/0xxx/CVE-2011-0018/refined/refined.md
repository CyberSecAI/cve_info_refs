Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0018:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data when processing OpenVAS Management Protocol (OMP) requests. Specifically, the `email()` function in `manage_sql.c` does not properly sanitize input, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  The application constructs a command string using user-provided data for email addresses (to and from), subject, and body without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands within the context of this string, which are then executed by the system shell.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation of the command injection vulnerability allows an authenticated user to elevate their privileges within OpenVAS Manager (e.g., by modifying the `isadmin` file used for privilege checks), potentially gaining root privileges.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The vulnerability can be triggered via a CSRF attack through the Greenbone Security Assistant web application, which communicates with OpenVAS Manager using OMP.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their privileges within the OpenVAS Manager system, potentially leading to complete control over the affected system if the OpenVAS Manager runs with root privileges.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** More complex injection attempts could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the OpenVAS Manager, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **OMP Requests:** The primary attack vector is through crafted OMP requests sent to the OpenVAS Manager.
- **Authenticated Users:** The vulnerable code path is accessible only to authenticated users of OpenVAS Manager.
- **CSRF via Greenbone Security Assistant:** The vulnerability can also be exploited through a CSRF attack via the Greenbone Security Assistant web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have valid credentials for OpenVAS Manager or an account in the Greenbone Security Assistant web application.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenVAS Manager server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content mentions the vulnerability was patched by Greenbone Networks, with new releases of versions 1.0.x and 2.0.x containing the fix.
- The advisory also notes that the CSRF aspect of the vulnerability in Greenbone Security Assistant was not addressed at the time of the report.
- Example of exploitation is given, showing how to modify the 'to\_address' field to achieve privilege escalation by creating the `/var/lib/openvas/users/alexander/isadmin` file.
