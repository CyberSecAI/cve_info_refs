Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-0666:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition in how Windows kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects. This occurs when a driver attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** Additionally, there is a null pointer dereference vulnerability in the way kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to these objects. This occurs when the driver attempts to access an invalid memory address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Kernel-mode driver object management:** The core issue lies in how the Windows kernel handles kernel-mode driver objects, leading to use-after-free conditions.
*   **Improper pointer management:** The Windows kernel drivers incorrectly manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects, resulting in null pointer dereferences.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Full System Control:** This grants the attacker complete control over the affected system.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new user accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system locally to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to run a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials for an account on the targeted machine.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs the ability to log on locally to the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects various Windows operating systems, including Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was issued and there were no reports of exploitation in the wild at the time of the bulletin's release.
*   The provided content indicates that multiple CVEs, including CVE-2011-0666, are related to the same set of vulnerabilities in kernel-mode drivers.
