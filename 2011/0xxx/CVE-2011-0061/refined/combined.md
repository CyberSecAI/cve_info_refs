Graphics: ImageLib
▾

Core :: Graphics: ImageLib
ImageLib decodes GIF, JPEG and PNG images, and provides the decoded data to the Compositor for display. If Firefox or Seamonkey can display an image when loaded separately from the page, ImageLib is working, and the actual imaging bug exists elsewhere within Firefox or Seamonkey.

Examples of appropriate bugs: PNG gAMA chunk ignored; Crashes on GIF w/corrupted frame(merr-01.gif); or PNGs and JPEGs aren't displayed on FreeBSD.

multipart/x-mixed-replace is a red herring. That URL seems to return different (fuzzed?) jpeg images and some of them are tickling [bug 557107](/show_bug.cgi?id=557107 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - crashes in JPEG decoder [@ ycc_rgb_convert]"), which we haven't had a testcase for. Some of the crashes are EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION\_WRITE so presumably exploitable. the crash reports point at
<http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.2/annotate/cd857b3b0e33/jpeg/jdcolor.c#l341>
The area around the crashing line was changed as part of [bug 411379](/show_bug.cgi?id=411379 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add SSE2 processing for JPEG color, use static instead of dynamic arrays"), may not be part of upstream jpeg.
Changing the keyword from testcase to testcase-wanted because the important bit will be to capture one of the images that trigger the crash.

The problem starts in the crash stack #4, nsJPEGDecoder::OutputScanlines:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/5ae1f2fa0d9f/modules/libpr0n/decoders/nsJPEGDecoder.cpp#l555>
where 'mImageData' is NULL. I tracked this back to an earlier failure
in EnsureCleanFrame (see 2nd stack), where it tries to reuse a frame
that has no image data.

It's a bit difficult to imagine how this could happen; I guess if we optimized the surface of the JPEG image.
This is obviously safer, but I think we should also turn off optimizing surfaces in the multipart/x-mixed-replace case. It's ok if you file that as a followup bug and cc bholley and me.

I haven't been able to replicate the crash on Windows or OS X using the test page pre-fix. Is there a more reliable way of inducing this crash?

The crash is very intermittent... but i've got a screenshot of one crash with with a line like 80 80 80 80 [...] before the access violation .
I think it's possible to localize this line on the JPG and maybe do a crash with evidence of corruption resulting in an overflow.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-09

## Crash caused by corrupted JPEG image

Announced
March 1, 2011
Reporter
Jordi Chancel
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.14
* Thunderbird 3.1.8

### Description

Security researcher **Jordi Chancel** reported that a
JPEG image could be constructed that would be decoded incorrectly,
causing data to be written past the end of a buffer created to store
the image. An attacker could potentially craft such an image that
would cause malicious code to be stored in memory and then later
executed on a victim's computer.

Firefox 3.5 was not affected by this issue.

firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0310)

Original Release Date: April 11, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-093

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox sanitized HTML content in extensions.
If an extension loaded or rendered malicious content using the
ParanoidFragmentSink class, it could fail to safely display the content,
causing Firefox to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the
user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1585](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1585.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled dialog boxes. An attacker could
use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a blank
dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the dialog
box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page elevated
privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0051](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0051.html) to this issue.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0053](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0053.html),
[CVE-2011-0055](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0055.html),
[CVE-2011-0058](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0058.html) and
[CVE-2011-0062](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0062.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox handled malformed JavaScript. A
website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox to execute that
JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0054](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0054.html),
[CVE-2011-0056](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0056.html) and
[CVE-2011-0057](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0057.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0061](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0061.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled plug-ins that perform HTTP
requests. If a plug-in performed an HTTP request, and the server sent a 307
redirect response, the plug-in was not notified, and the HTTP request was
forwarded. The forwarded request could contain custom headers, which could
result in a Cross Site Request Forgery attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0059](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0059.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | 7.0 and 7.5 | None | See mitigating factors. | | Avaya IQ | 4.0.x through 5.1.x | None | See mitigating factors. | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1 thru 6.1.2 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.3 or later. | | Avaya Aura™ System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-1585 CVE-2011-0051 CVE-2011-0053 CVE-2011-0054 CVE-2011-0055 CVE-2011-0056 CVE-2011-0057 CVE-2011-0058 CVE-2011-0059 CVE-2011-0061 CVE-2011-0062 | These are a Low for MN, MSS, PS, SM and SMGR as it would require non-standrard direct user interaction. There is no risk to IQ and CS1000 as firefox is not installed, only xulrunner. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura™ Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura™ System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.
