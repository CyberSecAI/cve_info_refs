  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A specially crafted JPEG image could cause a buffer overflow when decoded due to an incorrect calculation of the image size. Specifically, an optimized image was being rendered, which resulted in null image data being returned by the GetImageData() function, ultimately leading to a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect buffer size calculation",
       "Use of an optimized image",
        "Failure to handle null image data"

    "impact": "A crash or potentially arbitrary code execution due to memory corruption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a web page containing a malicious JPEG image",
      "An image with a src-attribute that refers to a multipart/x-mixed-replace resource serving crafted JPEG images"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a specially crafted JPEG image or serve it via a multipart/x-mixed-replace resource and entice the victim to load it into Firefox or Thunderbird."
