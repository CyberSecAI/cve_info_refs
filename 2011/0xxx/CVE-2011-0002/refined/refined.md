      "root_cause": "When creating LDAP users, libuser was not setting a strong default password and could under some circumstances allow logins with a default password.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "libuser creates LDAP users with a default password '!!' when no password is specified during user creation.",
          "This default password can be interpreted as a valid password, leading to unauthorized access.",
          "The default password '!!' decodes to '!!', which should not let the user log in according to RFC 2307 when used with nss_ldap. However, when using pam_ldap or connecting to the LDAP server directly, '!!' can be used as a plaintext password for authentication, especially with OpenLDAP."
      ],
      "impact": "Creation of user accounts with a default password that can be used to log in under certain circumstances.",
      "attack_vectors": [
          "An attacker could use the default '!!' password to log in through pam_ldap or directly to the LDAP server when the server is configured to allow it.",
          "An attacker could connect to the LDAP server using the '!!' password and change the user's password to something else."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the default password '!!', have network access to the LDAP server, and the LDAP server needs to be configured to accept '!!' as a valid password."
    },
    "additional_details": "The issue is present in libuser since RHEL 3 and is fixed by replacing the default password with '{crypt}!!' in the LDAP module of libuser during user creation. This fix ensures that the default password doesn't allow logins.  A python script example is provided to search for accounts without `{CRYPT}` as the password prefix.  The vulnerability is rated as medium severity due to the specific circumstances required for exploitation but is still considered a security vulnerability because it exposes a potential attack vector that may persist indefinitely for system accounts when password is never changed."
