  "CVE-2011-0664": {
    "related": true,
    "description": "A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Microsoft .NET Framework that can allow a specially crafted Microsoft .NET application to access memory in an unsafe manner. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the security context of the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the .NET Framework and Microsoft Silverlight improperly validate arguments passed to built-in networking functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of arguments passed to built-in networking functions"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution. An attacker could gain the same user rights as the local user or the user account of ASP.NET. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. In a Web hosting scenario, an attacker could gain the same permissions as the service account associated with the application pool identity of the application pool in which a Microsoft .NET application is running. Depending on application pool isolation configuration and permissions granted to the service account, an attacker might be able to take control over other application pools on the Web server or be able to take complete control of the affected system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web browsing scenario: An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that contains a specially crafted XBAP (XAML browser application) that could exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.",
        "Web hosting scenario: If a Web hosting environment allows users to upload custom ASP.NET applications, an attacker could upload a malicious ASP.NET application that uses this vulnerability to break out of the sandbox used to prevent ASP.NET code from performing harmful actions on the server system.",
        "Windows .NET applications: This vulnerability could also be used by Windows .NET applications to bypass Code Access Security (CAS) restrictions."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "For the web browsing scenario, an attacker would need to convince users to visit a malicious website, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message. For the web hosting scenario, an attacker needs permission to upload arbitrary ASP.NET pages to a Web site with ASP.NET installed. For windows .NET applications, the attacker needs to run an untrusted windows .NET application."
