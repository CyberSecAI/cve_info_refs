Create state-of-the-art conversational agents with Google AI

Using Dialogflow, you can provide new and engaging ways for users to interact with your product.

Dialogflow can analyze multiple types of input from your customers, including text or audio inputs (like from a phone or voice recording). It can also respond to your customers in a couple of ways, either through text or with synthetic speech. Dialogflow CX and ES provide virtual agent services for chatbots and contact centers. If you have a contact center that employs human agents, you can use Agent Assist to help your human agents. Agent Assist provides real-time suggestions for human agents while they are in conversations with end-user customers.

  No SQL database and clean look are best selling points of PivotX - beside the FLOSS license, of course!
