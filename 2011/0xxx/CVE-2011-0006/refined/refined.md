Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0006:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) handles the initialization of Linux Security Module (LSM) rules, specifically when an LSM (like SELinux) is disabled at runtime. If `security_filter_rule_init()` does not return a rule, the IMA policy can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect handling of empty LSM rules during IMA policy initialization.
- Failure to prevent the default IMA TCB policy from being replaced when LSM is disabled.
- An empty LSM rule causes `ima_match_rules()` to always succeed, effectively ignoring all remaining rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Subversion of the IMA policy.
-  The intended file integrity measurements are not performed, resulting in a loss of security.
-  With the boot parameter `tcb selinux=0`, adding a specific rule like `'dont_measure obj_type=var_log_t'` to the default IMA TCB policy would cause no files to be measured, effectively disabling the IMA.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation is possible through manipulation of the IMA policy when an LSM is disabled at runtime.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the IMA policy, which typically requires root or administrative privileges.
- The system must be booted with an LSM disabled (e.g., with `tcb selinux=0`).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.30-rc1 (commit `4af4662f`).
- The fix is in commit `867c20265459d30a01b021a9c1e81fb4c5832aa9`.
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and MRG were not affected, but Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was affected and received a patch.
