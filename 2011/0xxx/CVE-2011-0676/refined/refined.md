Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0676:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference issue in the Windows kernel-mode driver `win32k.sys`. This occurs because of the way kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects. Specifically, the driver fails to properly keep track of these pointers, leading to a dereference of a null pointer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper management of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.
- Null pointer dereference in `win32k.sys`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can run arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- This can lead to complete control of the affected system.
- The attacker could install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full administrative rights.
- Elevation of privilege from a regular user to kernel level.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to log on to the system locally.
- They would then run a specially crafted application to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Valid logon credentials to the target system
- Ability to execute code locally on the target system
- The attacker cannot exploit this vulnerability remotely or anonymously.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by correcting the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects.
- This is one of several vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
- This vulnerability was reported by Tarjei Mandt of Norman.
