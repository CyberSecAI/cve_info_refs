Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability arises from how Microsoft PowerPoint handles specifically crafted PowerPoint files. An invalid record within the file leads to an error, which can corrupt memory, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary code. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered when PowerPoint improperly validates `TimeColorBehaviorContainer` floating point records when opening PowerPoint files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Improper handling of records within the file structure leads to memory corruption.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The memory corruption can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain complete control of the affected system, executing arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker can then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data on the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** Attackers create a specially crafted PowerPoint file.
*   **Web-based Attack:** The malicious file can be hosted on a compromised or attacker-controlled website, luring victims to download it.
*  **Email Attachment:** The malicious file can be sent as an email attachment, tricking users into opening it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Technical Skill:** Attackers need technical expertise to create the malicious PowerPoint file.
*  **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to convince the user to open the file using social engineering tactics, or by luring them to a malicious site hosting the file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important".
*   The advisory provides workarounds, such as disabling editing in protected view in PowerPoint 2010 and using the Microsoft Office File Block policy.
*   The advisory also mentions the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) as a workaround for older versions of Office.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed prior to the security bulletin's release and there were no reports of it being actively exploited at the time.
