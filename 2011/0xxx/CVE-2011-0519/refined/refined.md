{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'id' parameter of the 'gallery.php' script.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:\n  - Data exfiltration of sensitive data, such as usernames and passwords.\n  - Modification or deletion of data within the database.\n  - Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploitable through a crafted HTTP GET request to the 'gallery.php' script, specifically by manipulating the 'id' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, without needing prior authentication. The attacker also needs to know that the application is vulnerable."
