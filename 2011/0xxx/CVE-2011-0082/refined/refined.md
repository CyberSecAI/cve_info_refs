Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0082:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Firefox fails to re-validate SSL/TLS certificates when loading HTTPS pages from the cache. This means that if a user visits a site with an untrusted certificate, adds a temporary exception, and then restarts the browser, the cached content is displayed without proper certificate validation.
- The issue stems from how Firefox caches and reuses security information associated with HTTPS connections, particularly when temporary exceptions are granted for untrusted certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Bypassed Certificate Validation:** The browser does not re-verify the validity of a certificate when retrieving a page from the cache, whether it's from memory or disk.
- **Confusion in Exception Handling:** After a browser restart, when a cached page with a previously untrusted certificate is loaded, Firefox incorrectly indicates that the site has a valid certificate. This prevents the user from adding a new temporary exception.
- **Potential for Serving Malicious Content:** An attacker could potentially exploit this by serving malicious content with a self-signed or otherwise untrusted certificate, which the browser would then cache. If a user adds a temporary exception and then restarts their browser, they might see the cached malicious content without a proper security warning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**  Users might unknowingly accept an invalid certificate, leading to potential MitM attacks where their communication can be intercepted and modified.
- **Displaying Potentially Malicious Cached Content:** If a malicious server serves malicious content with a self-signed certificate, a user might inadvertently trust it through temporary exception, and later the browser loads the cached copy after restart without proper certificate check.
- **Usability Issue:**  The inability to add a security exception makes it difficult to access legitimate sites with expired or self-signed certificates, resulting in user frustration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Self-Signed Certificates:** An attacker sets up a malicious server with a self-signed certificate.
- **Temporary Exception:** The user visits the malicious site, sees the warning, and adds a temporary exception.
- **Browser Restart:** The user restarts the browser and revisits the malicious site, the cached content is served without revalidating the certificate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Server:**  The attacker needs control of a server and the ability to serve content over HTTPS with an invalid certificate.
- **User Interaction:**  The attacker needs the user to initially visit the malicious site, add a temporary security exception, and then restart the browser.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Firefox versions 4.0.x and onwards.
- The bug report mentions that the issue is related to enabling HTTPS caching.
- The fix involves modifying the cache to store certificate hashes for validation rather than just serialized `nsNSSSocketInfo` and `nsSSLStatus` objects.
-  The patch involves ensuring that `nsNSSCertificate::Write` always saves the EV status as `ev_status_unknown` and then forces re-validation.
