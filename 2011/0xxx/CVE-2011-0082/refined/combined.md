| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |

Subject: CVE request: firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading HTTPS page

Hi,
found this in RH's bugzilla: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=709165>

Vincent Danen 2011-05-30 18:38:43 EDT

A Debian bug report [1] indicated that Firefox 4.0.x handled the
validation/revalidation of SSL certificates improperly.  If a user were to
visit a site with an untrusted certificate, Firefox would correctly display the
warning about the untrusted connection.  If a user were to confirm the security
exception for a single session (not check off the "permanently store this
exception"), then restart the browser and re-load the page, the contents of the
page would be displayed from the Firefox cache.  Upon reloading the page, the
security warning would appear, but incorrectly indicates that the site provides
a valid, verified certificate and there is no way to confirm the exception.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86\_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110322 Fedora/3.6.16-1.fc14 Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:2.0.1) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0.1
A Debian bug report indicated that Firefox 4.0.x handled the
validation/revalidation of SSL certificates improperly. If a user were to
visit a site with an untrusted certificate, Firefox would correctly display the
warning about the untrusted connection. If a user were to confirm the security
exception for a single session (not check off the "permanently store this
exception"), then restart the browser and re-load the page, the contents of the
page would be displayed from the Firefox cache. Upon reloading the page, the
security warning would appear, but incorrectly indicates that the site provides
a valid, verified certificate and there is no way to confirm the exception.
This is not the case in Firefox 3.6.17 where when re-loading the browser and
visiting the page, the untrusted connection warning comes up immediately,
without showing the contents of the page, and allowing you to confirm the
exception.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1) Visit a site with a self-signed certificate (such as <https://kitenet.net/>)
and click "I Understand The Risks", click "Add Exception", uncheck "Permanently
store this exception", click "Confirm Security Exception". The site's contents
will be displayed.
2) Exit the browser.
3) Start Firefox again and visit the page you visited in step 1. The browser
will show the contents of the page, even though its certificate should no
longer be considered valid.
4) Refresh the page. The untrusted connection warning will display again.
Click "I Understand The Risks", click "Add Exception". Firefox will indicate
that "This site provides valid, verified identification" and does not allow you
to confirm the security exception.

I'm not too concerned we're reading the content from the cache even though we should no longer be trusting the certificate -- the certificate was trusted at the time we saw that content. I could go either way on that, but if we're not hitting the network then it's analogous to the case when a certificate was revoked after the content was cached.
The state where we can't re-add the exception because it's trusted and not at the same time is a bug that needs to be fixed. If just that one dialog is confused it may not be that bad, but if we're confused at a deeper level it could result in loading untrusted content in some contexts.Blocks: [531801](/show_bug.cgi?id=531801 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should cache SSL content to disk even without Cache-Control: public")Keywords: [regression](/buglist.cgi?keywords=regression&resolution=---)Whiteboard: [sg:high?] â†’ [sg:low?]

I think the people who implemented caching in Firefox deliberately made this work like this. I think it's acceptable, if all we do is displaying the exact copy of what was displayed earlier.

Workaround to add the exception: Clear the cache.
Go to:
Tools
Clear recent history
select "everything"
keep "Cache" checked, uncheck everything else
clear now
After that, you should be able to add the exception.
Can you confirm the workaround helps you?

My company makes products that use web-interfaces to configure embedded computers, and we frequently encounter this bug. I would love to see it get addressed.
Using FF 6.0.2 I have confirmed that using browser.cache.disk\_cache\_ssl to false will prevent this from happening. If that is set to true, then clearing the cache will also workaround this bug.
(I posted a writeup of how to reproduce the problem in [bug 659736](/show_bug.cgi?id=659736 "RESOLVED FIXED - No way to add a security exception - \"This site provides valid, verified identification. There is no need to add an exception.\""), which covers the same issue.)
As a test I added a flag LOAD\_BYPASS\_CACHE to ignore the cache in mozilla-release/security/manager/pki/resources/content/exceptionDialog.js. This worked, too. Any chance of getting this, or some other workaround, added into the code base?
...
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
try {
if(uri) {
req.open('GET', uri.prePath, false);
req.channel.notificationCallbacks = new badCertListener();
req.channel.loadFlags |= Components.interfaces.nsIRequest.LOAD\_BYPASS\_CACHE;
req.send(null);
}

I know the cause and I think I have an idea for a fix. I \*think\* we can fix this issue within PSM without doing major changes to the cache or to the way Necko loads pages out of the cache. That solution involves changing the implementation of nsNSSSocketInfo::Read() to check that a verification has been done and failing if it doesn't. However, that solution is pretty wasteful; we have to do all the work of locating the entry in the cache and reading its metadata out of the cache, but then we never use that response.
IMO, what we \*really\* should do this this:
(1) Change the cache entry writing logic so that it stores a SHA-384 hash of the certificate, instead of the serialized nsNSSSocketInfo and nsSSLStatus instances. Also, do not write the cache entry if there were any SSL errors (including any cert errors or cert overrides).
(2) Change the cache entry reading logic so that it doom any cache entry for a HTTPS page we come across without this SHA-384 hash, and so that it verifies that a cert with that hash has already been verified in the current session.
(3) Remove the nsISerializable implementations for nsNSSSocketInfo and nsSSLStatus.
(4) Change Necko so that it starts the HTTPS connection without checking the cache first, if the resource is HTTPS and we haven't validated a certificate for the host in the current session.
(All of this is approximately what IE does, BTW.)
This latter implementation would be better for security \*AND\* use less disk space. Right now, every cache entry writes a serialized nsNSSSocketInfo, which includes a serialized copy of the cert and a serialized nsSSLStatus, which also includes a serialized copy of the cert. (That is, the same cert is written to disk twice, AFAICT.) This latter implementation would reduce the SSL-specific entry overhead from ~3,000-10,000 bytes per entry to <100 bytes per entry.
I will meet with Bjarne and Michal (and Patrick) to coordinate this work.Component: Security: PSM â†’ Networking: HTTPKeywords: [perf](/buglist.cgi?keywords=perf&resolution=---),

bsterne and I both looked at the proposal in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c8 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache") and it sounds good to us. i've asked other secteam members to take a look and comment in the bug if they have further questions/concerns.

The proposal in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c8 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache") doesn't work for WYCIWYG entries. For WYCIWYG, we need to serialize the nsIAssociatedContentSecurity information, at least, in addition to the the entire server certificate chain. Also, we cannot refuse to load a WYCIWYG resource out of the cache just because we haven't previously validated the cert yet. That means that we will not be able to avoid validating the cert during cache loads.
So, here is an amendment to the proposal in [comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c8 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache") for WYCIWYG entries only ([comment 8](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c8 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache") would still be applicable for non-WYCIWYG entries):
----
(1) Store the nsIAssociatedContentSecurity information \*and\* the full cert chain in the cache entry.
(2) Validate the certificate chain in the cache entry before returning it from the cache to Necko. This must happen off the socket transport thread. Ideally it would be asynchronous with the cache thread too, so that the cache thread doesn't get blocked.
----
Additionally, there are other uses of the nsISerializable implementation of nsNSSSocketInfo and nsSSLStatus--they are serialized for e10s. See [bug 568502](/show_bug.cgi?id=568502 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Security UI binding for multiprocess Fennec") and [bug 568504](/show_bug.cgi?id=568504 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Security UI binding for multiprocess Firefox"). In order to avoid unnecessary re-validations of certs for the e10s case, the value of isExtendedValidation() must be serialized/deserialized in nsSSLStatus.
The straightforward way to fix this would break compatibility with previously-cached entries (both WYCIWYG and non-WYCIWYG), but I think we can do so without changing the cache version (i.e. we don't have to blow away the entire cache for this transition). The consequence of this is that session restore for HTTPS pages wouldn't work during the upgrade restart.
If we aren't happy with that, then we can make the fix more complicated, and separate the serialization/deserialization logic used for the cache from the serialization/deserialization logic used for e10s. And/or, ideally, we would remove the need to serialize/deserialize the security info for e10s at all--that is, keep it all in the chrome process and never copy it to the child process.

The above analysis has assumed incorrectly that revalidation should only happen when loading from the disk cache. However, we should also revalidate when loading from the memory cache if the cert validation might be stale. For example, if the browser has been running for three days, a memory cache entry might have a cert that was valid three days ago but which expired yesterday. However, we don't want to do re-validation excessively (for every cache load), because performance would be horrible. Instead, we will have to implement a cache of SSL cert validation results that allows us to avoid revalidation for a period of time that we think is reasonable w.r.t. staleness. Wan-Teh said Chrome also does this and they invalidate cache SSL cert validation cache entries after they are 30 minutes old. I think a policy like that is reasonable.
This means the cert validation logic should happen in nsCacheService::SearchCacheDevices or higher in the call stack.

What should happen when the server returns a 304 Not Modified response and the cached document has different security properties (e.g. different cert) from the connection?
Let's assume that the client previously cached a document from a malicious server, e.g. by adding a cert override. Then, we don't really want to use the cached document. Similarly, if the connection returning the 304 is from a malicious server, but the cached document was from a good server, then we would not want to use the cached document either, because it might contain sensitive information that could be retrieved by the attacker that sent the 304 response.
I propose that, when we look up the validators for a cached entry, we compare the cert to the cert that we will use for the connection; if they match, carry on; if they are different certs, then don't provide those validators in our (conditional) request.
However, a malicious server could return a 304 response even to an unconditional request. That means we would also have to ensure that we do, or have already done, the "same cert" check for whatever resource we look up from the cache in response to the 304.

Re: [comment 16](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c16 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache"). We may be able to do the above checks for a 304 somewhat sensibly, but then a 304 would work differently from a 301/302/303 redirect to the same server, which seems wrong. It seems like, if we want to apply "same cert" logic, we must do so consistently in many places, including just regular document navigation or document/subdocument structures, or not at all. And, the Citibank problem makes me think "not a all" is probably the right answer.

Kai, why do you think this is a regression? When did we ever re-validate SSL certificates from cached documents (in the memory cache or from disk cache)? I tried to search back in hg history to see if some such logic got removed, but I couldn't find any such removed logic.

I think that this may have been made \*worse\* by enabling HTTPS pages to be cached on disk. However, I think that it probably existed previously in a milder form, when we allowed HTTPS pages to be cached in memory.

The proper fix for this will be too much for ESR. It will require the SSL thread removal that is in the release after ESR, multiple changes to the HTTP cache, as-yet-unfinished in-memory certificate validation result caching, etc.
I am not sure that this is an issue that qualifies for ESR at all. If we need a solution for ESR, I suggest that we make that solution be "disable all caching of HTTPS pages," for ESR only. And/or, document the workaround of clearing the caches.

From ESR corporate usability perspective, the worst part of this bug is the inability to add a new exception (as the "add exception" dialog thinks that there already exists a valid exception). Firefox should enable the user to replace the old exception with a new one, if he so wishes. Hopefully at least the dialog might be fixed rather soon, also for ESR.

After reading the above, this does not meet the requirement for ESR. I will let release-drivers have the final say though.

This does not meet the criteria for ESR as Brian notes in [Comment#37](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c37 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache"). We are only considering fixes that are regressions in FF10, major stability issues, or security issues.

I think this is already what happens, and is partially the opposite behavior of what is being requested in this bug.
I think that if there is any cert error, then the cache entry should be doomed and the resource reloaded from the network.

Kaie, I've been bitten by what seems to be this bug (see duplicate). The symptoms include an error page that says that the website provides no identity information (using another browser shows that the website \*does\* have a proper certificate) and no way at all to solve it. I can't even add an exception to says "please let me see the website".
The other bug report (from me) mentions that this starts happening in Firefox 16 so there's potential for a regression here.

This is a bug in the HTTP cache. The HTTP cache needs to validate the certificate for the cached entry. PSM provides an API for doing this: SSLServerCertVerificationJob::Dispatch. You can see how this is used in the function AuthCertificateHook in security/manager/ssl/src/SSLServerCertVerification.cpp:
socketInfo->SetCertVerificationWaiting();
SECStatus rv = SSLServerCertVerificationJob::Dispatch(
certVerifier, static\_cast<const void\*>(fd), socketInfo,
serverCert, stapledOCSPResponse, providerFlags, now);
The HTTP cache needs to do something similar. Note that currently the HTTP cache doesn't store all the information that is needed to re-validate the cached entry.Component: Networking: HTTP â†’ Networking: Cache

Judging by the attached patch, and the behaviour I've noticed, the problem is in nsNSSCertificate.cpp
I have changed the Write method so that it always saves ev\_status\_unknown as the cached status.
Turns out that after the certificate and status are read from cache, rechecking the status immediately will cause mCachedEVStatus to be set to ev\_status\_invalid. Later calls would return a valid status, but because mCachedEVStatus is set to a definite state, later checks aren't even performed.
This causes certificates loaded from cache to be missing the green EV mark, and even a hard refresh doesn't restore it (browser restart sometimes works).
In the patch I added a mCachedEVStatusIsStale attribute, which forces revalidation for certificates loaded from cache. The behaviour I'm observing is that the first load doesn't have the secure EV mark, but a refresh will cause a revalidation, and the tag appears.
Also, I was unable to use SSLServerCertVerificationJob::Dispatch, even in nsNSSCertificate.cpp (it doesn't seem to be a public API).
I don't think my fix is optimal, or even safe for that matter, but it does illustrate that we can/should fix the issue in the PSM code, rather than in the cache code.
Brian, do you think I'm interpreting the behaviour correctly, or is there something I missed?Assignee: valentin.gosu â†’ nobodyBlocks: [1040086](/show_bug.cgi?id=1040086 "VERIFIED FIXED - EV identifier is no longer displayed for addons.mozilla.org when restoring session and HTTP cache v2 enabled")Flags: needinfo?(brian)

Dana, could you also weigh in on [comment 52](/show_bug.cgi?id=660749#c52 "NEW - Firefox doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading a HTTPS page from the cache")? [Bug 1040086](/show_bug.cgi?id=1040086 "VERIFIED FIXED - EV identifier is no longer displayed for addons.mozilla.org when restoring session and HTTP cache v2 enabled") seems pretty urgent, and maybe we can fix this before it moves from beta.Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

So, when we from some reason (must be checked yet!) store the ev cached state as "unknown" in the cache entry, the cached certificate fails to do OCSP check since CertVerifier::FLAG\_LOCAL\_ONLY is set when nsNSSCertificate::GetIsExtendedValidation gets called and we so far don't have any OCSP response in the local cache:

Using [bug 1040086](/show_bug.cgi?id=1040086 "VERIFIED FIXED - EV identifier is no longer displayed for addons.mozilla.org when restoring session and HTTP cache v2 enabled")#c10, cannot reproduce.
The thing is that "security-info" meta is not set on the cache entry sooner than after OnStartRequest that doesn't happen sooner than after the cert is verified (we block on OCSP). I'm no expert to the cert verification code either, brian (re)wrote it. Since I cannot reproduce, this is hard for me to figure out easily.
Note: during non-cached load the certificate is set on the ssl info object at (SSL Cert #1 thread):
xul.dll!mozilla::psm::`anonymous namespace'::AuthCertificate({...}, 0x14555c50, 0x1780c010, {...}, 0x18bfd0d0, 0x00000000, {...}) Line 803 C++
if (status && !status->mServerCert) {
> status->mServerCert = nsc;
PR\_LOG(gPIPNSSLog, PR\_LOG\_DEBUG,
("AuthCertificate setting NEW cert %p\n", status->mServerCert.get()));
}
xul.dll!mozilla::psm::`anonymous namespace'::SSLServerCertVerificationJob::Run() Line 900 C++
xul.dll!nsThreadPool::Run() Line 222 C++
The cert (nsc) is created with nsNSSCertificate::Create(cert, &evOidPolicy); call few lines above, so it has set the cached ev status from its very life start.
Then we restart the handshake (suspended) on the sts thread.

I don't actually think fixing this bug will improve the situation for [bug 1040086](/show_bug.cgi?id=1040086 "VERIFIED FIXED - EV identifier is no longer displayed for addons.mozilla.org when restoring session and HTTP cache v2 enabled"). Keep in mind that a certificate will only verify as EV if we either have cached OCSP responses or can access the network. Since we don't save OCSP responses persistently, on startup we basically have no OCSP cache (our work on OCSP GET will improve this, but not all responders will support GET, so this will always apply). Thus, when loading a site that was EV from the cache, if we re-validate the certificate, we will either take the performance hit on fetching an OCSP response or we won't show the EV indicator.
To fix [bug 1040086](/show_bug.cgi?id=1040086 "VERIFIED FIXED - EV identifier is no longer displayed for addons.mozilla.org when restoring session and HTTP cache v2 enabled") without sacrificing performance, we should figure out why mCachedEVStatus is getting saved in the cache with an incorrect value.Flags: needinfo?(dkeeler)

|  | |

As far as I could tell, there is no way to determine if the mCachedEVStatus has been computed, from the cache code.
Also I feel it is a problem that if mCachedEVStatus is set to invalid, due to not having the OCSP response, there is no way of revalidating it until a restart is performed. I think we should make this possible, at least when doing a forced refresh.

 certificates when loading HTTPS page

Looks like Red Hat reported this upstream to Mozilla late last night...

Mozilla is tracking this as
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=660749>.

No CVE has been assigned yet (afaict), but I'll see about getting one
assigned once this has been confirmed.

 certificates when loading HTTPS page

I'm going to save this one for upstream. It's possible they've already
assigned something (Mozilla is a CNA).

I've CC'd Reed in the rare event he doesn't know about this.

Thanks.

Subject: iceweasel doesn't (re)validate certificates when loading HTTPS page
from cache
Date: Sat, 21 May 2011 23:56:00 +0200
```
Package: iceweasel
Version: 4.0.1-2
Severity: important
Tags: security

It looks like when Iceweasel loads an HTTPS page from cache, it doesn't
verify if its certificate is (still) valid. Here's how to reproduce this
bug:

1. Try to visit <https://kitenet.net/>. Iceweasel (correctly) displays
scary warning about the untrusted connection. Click "I Understand The
Risks", click "Add Exception", uncheck "Permanently store this
exception", click "Confirm Security Exception". Iceweasel shows contents
of the page.

2. Close the browser. The kitenet.net's certificate should be no longer
consider valid past this point.

3. Start Iceweasel again. Try to visit <https://kitenet.net/>. The browser
happily shows contents of the page (presumably loaded from cache), even
though its certificate is not valid anymore.

4. For added fun, try to refresh the page. Iceweasel displays scary
warning about the untrusted connection. Click "I Understand The Risks",
click "Add Exception". The browser says that "This site provides valid,
verified identification" and doesn't allow you to confirm security
exception. So it turns out the certificate is both valid and invalid at
the same time...

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=709165#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-05-30 22:38:43 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1] indicated that Firefox 4.0.x handled the validation/revalidation of SSL certificates improperly.  If a user were to visit a site with an untrusted certificate, Firefox would correctly display the warning about the untrusted connection.  If a user were to confirm the security exception for a single session (not check off the "permanently store this exception"), then restart the browser and re-load the page, the contents of the page would be displayed from the Firefox cache.  Upon reloading the page, the security warning would appear, but incorrectly indicates that the site provides a valid, verified certificate and there is no way to confirm the exception.  This is not the case in Firefox 3.6.17 where when re-loading the browser and visiting the page, the untrusted connection warning comes up immediately, without showing the contents of the page, and allowing you to confirm the exception.  Steps to reproduce:  1) Visit a site with a self-signed certificate (such as <https://kitenet.net/>) and click "I Understand The Risks", click "Add Exception", uncheck "Permanently store this exception", click "Confirm Security Exception".  The site's contents will be displayed.  2) Exit the browser.  3) Start Firefox again and visit the page you visited in step 1.  The browser will show the contents of the page, even though its certificate should no longer be considered valid.  4) Refresh the page.  The untrusted connection warning will display again.  Click "I Understand The Risks", click "Add Exception".  Firefox will indicate that "This site provides valid, verified identification" and does not allow you to confirm the security exception.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
