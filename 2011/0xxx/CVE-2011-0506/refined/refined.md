{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application includes a file based on user-controlled input without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Local File Inclusion (LFI)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can include arbitrary local files, potentially leading to information disclosure by reading sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd) or other local files.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `aXconf[default_language]` parameter in the URL.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is mentioned as required."
  },
  "affected_software": {
    "name": "axdcms",
    "version": "0.1.1"
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided exploit example demonstrates reading the /etc/passwd file by using path traversal techniques and a null byte injection. The vulnerable code snippet `include(\"modules/profile/lang/\".\$aXconf['default_language'].\".php\");` clearly shows how the unsanitized user input is used directly in the include function, causing the vulnerability.",
  "cve": "CVE-2011-0506"
