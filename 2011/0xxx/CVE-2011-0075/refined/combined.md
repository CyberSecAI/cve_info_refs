User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86\_64; rv:2.0b7) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b7
Build Identifier: Firefox 4.0b7
Opening a specific HTML document consisting mainly of marquee elements causes current Firefox 4.0b7 to crash with an invalid read of size 4 with a high address (0xf0dea813) in libxul.so.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1.$ echo "<foo> <marquee> <marquee> <marquee> <marquee> <marquee>
<marquee> <foo> <marquee> <foo> <marquee> <foo> <object> <marquee>
<foo> <marquee> <marquee> <foo> <foo> <marquee> <marquee> <foo>
<marquee> <marquee> <marquee> <foo> <marquee> <foo> <foo> <marquee>
<marquee>" > marquee.html
2.
3. firefox marquee.html
Actual Results:
Firefox crashes with a segfault.
Expected Results:
Firefox remains running.
This looks like a potentially dangerous crash to me. 4.0 stable release is probably not too far off, and many people are already using 4.0 beta series, so reporting this as a security issue to be on the safe side.

Fwiw, on 10.6 builds that old don't build either. But nothing in that range looks obviously relevant...

It looks like the poisoned frame pointer is coming from nsFrame::DoGetParentStyleContextFrame (on an nsBlockFrame with a :-moz-anonymous-block style context), where we should have gone (based on examining the frame we were calling it for) through the not-out-of-flow but special-frame codepath:
\*aProviderFrame = GetIBSpecialSiblingForAnonymousBlock(this);
if (\*aProviderFrame) {
return NS\_OK;
}
So that implies that we have a dangling pointer in the nsIFrame::IBSplitSpecialPrevSibling frame property.

Based on the valgrind data, I'm guessing that means we somehow got a next-in-flow as an IBSplitSpecialPrevSibling, which really shouldn't happen; that should always point to the first-in-flow, I thought.

Or, perhaps more likely, we called DeleteNextInFlowChild on something that was supposed to be empty, but it wasn't empty because it erroneously reported NS\_FRAME\_IS\_COMPLETE.

Yes. I added assertions for this, and they fire on this testcase (but not in normal browsing of a few sites).

Yes, it's in my patch queue.
We're returning NS\_FRAME\_IS\_COMPLETE incorrectly because of nsFrame::IsFrameTreeTooDeep. Joy.
Maybe if I hack initialization of nsHTMLReflowState::mReflowDepth for the reflow root case to match what we do in the reflow-from-root case, it will fix this...

It doesn't. I guess I'll have to investigate how we end up with the frame being split.

Reflow depth for a given frame seems to vary quite a bit.
Given that, I think the better solution is to just report incomplete status when appropriate.

I think a console warning in this case is appropriate; it would have helped me to know that we were entering this code.
But we don't need the old DEBUG\_kipp blocks that don't compile anymore.

I don't think that AssertFrameTreeIsEmpty is the best name for this. Apart from text frames, we also support split image frames, so this can return true even when there's real content in the frame tree.
+ // Should we also assert about text frames not mapping any text, or is

It should be fixed in the next continuation, but there's no harm in asserting it.

Some of the bugs in the regression range appear to have been fixed in 1.9.1 as well. Does this affect that branch? Or can we narrow the regression range to a specific patch so we can see if that's one of the ones that was backported?

I don't know why it doesn't crash on 1.9.1; I'd have thought the underlying problem would be present going back pretty much forever. It's possible it's something specific to the testcase.
The patch should be safe to take on 1.9.1 if we want to take it there.

The fact that the regression ranges are all different on win opt, linux opt, and linux debug and none of them contains anything suspicious probably means we are just getting lucky when it doesn't crash.

I cannot reproduce the crash using the testcase in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=619021#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash when opening a page with several marquee elements [@ nsStyleSet::GetContext ]") with the Firefox 4 beta 10 build (pre-fix) on Windows 7 or OS X 10.6.
Is there a better STR?

The testcase in [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=619021#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash when opening a page with several marquee elements [@ nsStyleSet::GetContext ]") worked pretty reliably for me, if my memory is correct. (Were you really using the one in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=619021#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash when opening a page with several marquee elements [@ nsStyleSet::GetContext ]") instead?)

I was on 64-bit Linux. tn also saw it on Windows ([comment 5](/show_bug.cgi?id=619021#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash when opening a page with several marquee elements [@ nsStyleSet::GetContext ]") and [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=619021#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash when opening a page with several marquee elements [@ nsStyleSet::GetContext ]")), and Jesse did on Mac ([comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=619021#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash when opening a page with several marquee elements [@ nsStyleSet::GetContext ]")).

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

                 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, an unbranded
version of the Thunderbird mail/news client.

CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

   "Scoobidiver", Ian Beer Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo,
   Mats Palmgren, Jesse Ruderman, Aki Kelin and Martin Barbella
   discovered memory corruption bugs, which may lead to the execution
   of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0073

   "regenrecht" discovered several dangling pointer vulnerabilities,
   which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0067

   Paul Stone discovered that Java applets could steal information
   from the autocompletion history.

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Iceape internet suite, an
unbranded version of Seamonkey:

CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081

   "Scoobidiver", Ian Beer Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo,
   Mats Palmgren, Jesse Ruderman, Aki Kelin and Martin Barbella
   discovered memory corruption bugs, which may lead to the execution
   of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0073

   "regenrecht" discovered several dangling pointer vulnerabilities,
   which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2011-0067

   Paul Stone discovered that Java applets could steal information
   from the autocompletion history.

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-5.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686 on x86\_64; rv:2.0b11) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/4.0b11
Build Identifier: 4.0b11
Firefox 4.0b11 crashes in libxul with a segfault on a bad and possibly controllable read when given an iframe with source address ";%80".
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. echo '<iframe src=";%80">' > page.html
2. ...
3. firefox page.html
Actual Results:
Firefox is sorry it followed a bad pointer.
Expected Results:
Firefox should only follow good pointers.
The above minimal case crashes with:
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
[Switching to Thread 0xeffffb70 (LWP 31736)]
0xf71dafaf in ?? () from ./libxul.so
=> 0xf71dafaf: mov (%edx,%eax,4),%edi
with eax = -1, edx = 0
Different files causing this seem to have edx=0, but eax as different values like -256975184, which make this look less like a harmless null deref. Filing conservatively as a security issue.

I tried to reproduce this with <http://office.smedbergs.us/test.html> and your attached testcase and I did not crash on any OS with nightly builds or b11. Do you have any extensions installed? Can you reproduce this in a new profile?

No crash here either when following the link, but if the file is saved and opened locally, Firefox crashes when opening it. Curious.
No extensions installed here. The computer has 64-bit Ubuntu 10.10. After removing $HOME/.mozilla, first load did not crash, but all the subsequent ones did.

I do see a crash here, from local file. It's preceded by two assertions:
###!!! ASSERTION: Got Stop on wrong stream.: 'mRequest == aRequest', file /Users/bzbarsky/mozilla/vanilla/mozilla/parser/html/nsHtml5StreamParser.cpp, line 751
###!!! ASSERTION: Stream ended without being open.: 'STREAM\_BEING\_READ == mStreamState', file /Users/bzbarsky/mozilla/vanilla/mozilla/parser/html/nsHtml5StreamParser.cpp, line 706
The actual crash has happened in three different places so far, but I bet if we fix those asserts we'll fix the crash too.Status: UNCONFIRMED → NEWComponent: General → HTML: ParserEver confirmed: trueQA Contact: general → parser

It's quite interesting that I can reliably crash with breakpad saying things like "No proper signature could be created because no good data for the crashing thread (7) was found". Ted might be interested in that.

In this case what seems to be happening is that nsHtml5StreamParser::OnStopRequest fires for the subframe URI when mRequest is null. At this point mStreamState is STREAM\_NOT\_STARTED.

OK, this is a bug in nsIndexedToHTML (hence the local-only aspect). In particular, there are all sorts of cases in which nsIndexedToHTML::OnStartRequest has all sorts of cases in which it takes early returns without calling OnStartRequest on mListener. One of these is the "unescape the filename failed" case, which is what we're hitting here, depending on the filesystem charset (which is why I think Benjamin can't reproduce). But nsIndexedToHTML::OnStopRequest always calls OnStopRequest on the listener.Component: HTML: Parser → NetworkingQA Contact: parser → networking

Patch
Looks good. If this passes manual testing, I'd be fine not having an automated test. This is a simple patch, and it clears up a large set of obviously incorrect return paths.
>+ // Push buffer to the listener now, so the initial HTML will not
>+ // be parsed in OnDataAvailable().
Is it just me or does this comment belong above the call to FormatInputStream, not here? We won't be pushing to the listener if OnStartRequest fails. I'm also not clear on how "the initial HTML would get parsed" if we didn't call FormatInputStream, but whatever. Seems like "Parse initial data and call OnDataAvailable" is a more accurate summary. But I don't know this code that well.

> Is it just me or does this comment belong above the call to FormatInputStream,
Yes. I've moved it there and changed it to just say "Push our buffer to the listener".
I have no idea what that comment was trying to say; it's part of the initial checkin of the file in 2001. Ccing dougt in case he happens to recall what he meant.

Patch
Requesting 2.0 approval. This should be a very safe change and it fixes what looks like a possibly exploitable crash that can happen when loading local HTML files.

FTP directory listings also use nsIndexedToHTML. Could this be remotely triggered on an FTP site? If so, might be worse than sg:moderate.

Hmm. Yes, FTP may be able to cause the same issues.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

This is moderate so usually wounldn't qualify for a bounty, but we will award $500 based on the possibilty that the ftp idea could be turned into an exploit PoC. Aki, if you wanted to try that we could up the bounty on this.

Core :: Layout: Images, Video, and HTML Frames

Issues with the CSS images and other replaced content. This includes loading, layout, and rendering of CSS images (such as in background-image), and the layout of HTML img, picture, video, iframe, frame, and frameset elements. For issues with image decoding and video playback, see the ImageLib and Audio/Video components respectively.

Example bugs:

* SVG as image with an intrinsic width and max-height has its width incorrectly scaled down by the same ratio as the height is scaled down
* <iframe> has incorrect default size in vertical writing mode

Specifications covered:

* CSS Backgrounds
* CSS Images

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.04 (lucid) Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier: 3.6.13
When creating a frameset element both a rows and cols spec are parsed by nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol, which limits their sizes to 100'000 elements.
If a frameset spec is created where the product of the rows and cols sizes is >= 2^32 we overflow the PRInt32 numCells:
layout/generic/nsFrameSetFrame.cpp
352 PRInt32 numCells = mNumRows\*mNumCols;
369 mChildFrameborder = new nsFrameborder[numCells];
With carefully crafted values for the rows and cols spec this can lead to arbitrary code execution on some platforms.

Analysis:
The POC creates a frameset with 61751 rows and 69553 cols, which overflows to allocate memory for 7 frames.
nsHTMLFramesetFrame::Init uses this 7 value throughout and I can't find any opportunity for a heap overflow there, but nsHTMLFramesetFrame::SetBorderResize uses the mNumRows and mNumCols values to iterate through the cells.
(PRInt32 childX = aBorderFrame->mPrevNeighbor + (rowX \* mNumCols);)
It passes the computed index to nsHTMLFramesetFrame::CanChildResize, which calls nsFrameList::FrameAt(PRInt32 aIndex) with the out of bounds index:
276 nsFrameList::FrameAt(PRInt32 aIndex) const
277 {
278 NS\_PRECONDITION(aIndex >= 0, "invalid arg");
279 if (aIndex < 0) return nsnull;
280 nsIFrame\* frame = mFirstChild;
281 while ((aIndex-- > 0) && frame) {
282 frame = frame->GetNextSibling();
283 }
284 return frame;
This will walk off the end of the list and return NULL.
This is then passed to nsHTMLFramesetFrame::GetNoResize without checking for NULL. GetNoResize also performs no NULL check on the pointer it is passed before executing:
1359 nsIContent\* content = aChildFrame->GetContent();
(where aChildFrame is a NULL pointer)
If you can map the null page (eg: an older version of linux, not sure about other systems) you could heap spray hoping to control memory just above 0x00000000 to gain control of execution flow.
There may be a more elegant heap overflow possible using the integer overflow but I haven't found one.
The fix would be to limit the size of frameset specs to something way below 100'000, and a null check on the return value of nsFrameList::FrameAt.

I don't see how this could be other than a null deref, and we're generally less worried about old systems that let you map memory at null since so many things fall down in that case.
What insane pages are going to break if we limited framesets to 10x10, 100x100, or 250x250? or even 1024x1024? We don't need to allow framesets with 10 billion frames.blocking1.9.1: ? → ---blocking1.9.2: ? → ---blocking2.0: ? → ---Keywords: [crash](/buglist.cgi?keywords=crash&resolution=---),

Exploiting that particular code path I agree does require the ability to map the null page which really should be stopped by the OS.
However I still think this is exploitable; for example using the method outline in the report for [bug 576447](/show_bug.cgi?id=576447 "RESOLVED FIXED - FRAMESET integer overflow via new operator in nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol()") where the overflow actually happens in the new[] allocator.
Crafting new frameset specs with smaller sizes (eg 2^16) leads to this style of overflow and a different AV/crash.
I will attach a new POC showing this.

This POC just sets mNumRows and mNumCols to 2^16+1 instead, which segfaults inside nsHTMLFramesetFrame::Init
With more carefully chosen values than these for mNumCols and mNumRows (taking into account the sizes of the array elements being allocated) it should be possible to control the overflow more carefully such that a heap overflow is possible.
I will do some more work on it an attach better POC + trace tomorrow.

As per the method used for [bug 576447](/show_bug.cgi?id=576447 "RESOLVED FIXED - FRAMESET integer overflow via new operator in nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol()"), this now sets the rows to 3078 and the cols to 87211. This leads to the correct value being computed for numCells and to the correct allocations of mChildTypes and mChildFrameborder (which both have sizes of 4 bytes.)
However, when allocating:
370 mChildBorderColors = new nsBorderColor[numCells];
the size of struct nsBorderColor is 16 bytes, which leads to an allocation of 16\*87211\*3078 mod 2^32 == 32 bytes.
nsBorderColor is defined as:
64 struct nsBorderColor
65 {
66 nscolor mLeft;
67 nscolor mRight;
68 nscolor mTop;
69 nscolor mBottom;
70
71 nsBorderColor() { Set(NO\_COLOR); }
72 ~nsBorderColor() {}
73 void Set(nscolor aColor) { mLeft = mRight = mTop = mBottom = aColor; }
74 };
so the constructor is called for numCells elements in the array (where numCells == 87211\*3078) leading to a heap overflow, which with more work could be more controlled leading to arbitrary code execution.
I've changed the whiteboard back to [sg:critical?] since this shows that the vuln can lead to more than just a null deref.
I'm very new to the firefox dev environment, if the decision as to whether it's critical or not isn't mine to make then please change it back!Whiteboard: [sg:dos?] → [sg:critical?]

This fix changes the maximum number of frameset rows and cols to 100. It adds PR\_STATIC\_ASSERT's to check that overflows don't occur during the allocations. These assert's cause compile time failures when using the original value of 100000 for the maximum value.

Um... there are some really old bugs in which they were complaining about our 5000-frame-total cap on frame trees and the like... (And it might not have been Lotus, though I think it was. It was \_definitely\_ something IBM.) I could dig up the bug numbers if that would really help, I guess.

This patch allows 100 frames in each direction. Nested framesets could easily take the total number of frames over 5000 if people wanted that. The question is whether people need more than 100 rows or columns in a single frameset.

Maybe instead of capping NS\_MAX\_FRAMESET\_SPEC\_COUNT we should just check that memory allocation calculations don't overflow, and move on. Or set the limit to something ridiculously high like 16000.
As for the test, we can try create a frameset which is 20,000 x 1 and see if we get the number of frames we expect.

Unfortunately I don't think we can trust the implementation. See [bug 466445](/show_bug.cgi?id=466445 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - |new []| can integer-overflow with gcc (g++)") and [bug 576447](/show_bug.cgi?id=576447 "RESOLVED FIXED - FRAMESET integer overflow via new operator in nsHTMLFrameSetElement::ParseRowCol()") for an example of it in practice.

Crashtests
On discussion with roc I'm obsoleting the crash test. I've been unable to create a test that doesn't consume huge amounts of memory (>2GB) when succeeding.

Fix for mozilla-central
Requesting approval to land on 1.9.2 and 1.9.1. The patch has baked on mozilla-central for about a week without issues. The patch has no performance issues.
The oly backwards compatibility issue I can think of is that we've lowered the number of frames that a frameset can have to 16,000. Frames with more than this number previously would allocate enormous amounts of memory, or crash and hit the error described in this bug so I don't see this as a risk.
Tests were not included on discussion with roc as the tests that could trigger the error case allocated many gigabytes of memory making it problematic to run.

I notice that this still crashes 3.6.14, released a couple of days ago.
(at least on the Ubuntu 10.10 3.6.14 packages which went out today)
Should this have been patched in that release?

No, Ian. Read [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=623998#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - Integer overflow in frameset spec (not bug 576447) w/gcc compiler"). This is approved for 1.9.2.15 (which will be 1.9.2.16 as of this morning). This was not fixed in 1.9.2.14 or 3.6.14.

You're right, sorry. I'd just upgraded the ubuntu package, ran some quick tests and saw this crash. I hadn't read that comment properly, my bad.

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

This DEFINETLY would be cool and would go along perfectly with the cookie
manager, the ability to only accept original images/cookies, and the wallet.
Once moz has all of these it would be the de facto security/privecy browser.

Agreed. This is something I've been considering for awhile, and it is definitely
on my priority list to implement some P3P support. First, I'd like a good
general mechanism for storing site-specific prefs, like the cookie manager does.
I'll see if I can leverage existing code for this, or rewrite it more generally.
If somebody else wants to work on P3P support before I get to it, please do;
I'll accept patches in this area.Status: NEW → ASSIGNED

I'm getting ready to contribute P3P support as soon as I get past all the
open source submission stuff I'm supposed to get through. Should be a few days
from now hopefully. The support is current to the September 15, 2000 version of
the spec. I'll have more to say once it's available to the community.

Thomas,
Can you post your changes as a patch here? That way I can review them and get
them approved, and hopefully start integrating it with other privacy code.

First of all, [bug 63096](/show_bug.cgi?id=63096 "RESOLVED WONTFIX - Add \"P3P\" component") is not a duplicate of this bug.
The Platform for Privacy Preferences 1.0 (P3P1.0) Specification may be visit by
using this uri: <http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-P3P-20001215/>
It's a W3C Candidate Recommendation starting from December 15.
Microsoft is working hard on this issue, Netscape/Mozilla should do this also.
Protecting the users privacy is getting more and more attention, this will be
very important, for a lot of us.

I've just posted Tom Lendacky of IBM's patches for P3P support, with a textfile
that explains how to merge them. This code has a problem which is documented in
[bug 64668](/show_bug.cgi?id=64668 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsParser calling nsFileInputStream::ReadSegments which is not yet implemented"). If anyone wants to work on integrating this stuff before I get to it,
please go ahead.

I thought of a way to temporarily work around [bug 64668](/show_bug.cgi?id=64668 "VERIFIED FIXED - nsParser calling nsFileInputStream::ReadSegments which is not yet implemented"). It requires the
following:
1. Copy the P3P Base Dataschema (p3p\resources\content\P3PBaseDataSchema.xml) to
a local HTTP server.
2. Modify p3p\src\nsP3PDataSchema.cpp::PostInit to point to the local HTTP
server copy: In the "if (aURISpec.EqualsWithConversion( P3P\_BASE\_DATASCHEMA ))"
block, set mReadURISpec and mcsReadURISpec to the URL where the base dataschema
file was copied to, leave mUseDOMParser as false, and return NS\_OK right after.
This should work. However when I tested it I kept getting random failures in
the parsing of the XML file saying that the file is not well formed. These
failures happen at different spots in the file. Loading it directly into the
browser window sometimes worked and sometimes failed. Loading the XML file with
IE was always successful. So it looks like there is a parsing bug in Mozilla.

What needs to be done to get to December 2000 specification.
MUST
- policy refrence file referenced by a LINK tag can specify policies other than
the URI prefix as the policy reference file itself.
- P3P parser should taught about TEST element and NON-IDENTIFIABLE element.
- import user preferences using a documented mechanism ( need APPEL support ).
- Base Data Schema should be updated to comply with December 2000 spec.
- support COOKIE-INCLUDE and COOKIE-EXCLUDE.
MAY
- support Compact Policies.
- support POLICIES element within policy.
- support multiple languages.
- export user preferences.

Tom, could you please take a look at my previous comment and let me know if I
missed something? Thanks

Supporting the POLICIES element is a MUST. Additionally, there are some XML
tags and attributes that had a spelling change and these MUST be corrected to
match the new spelling.
Other than that your list looks good.

I've attached some changes needed after I cvs removed pref-utilities.js
recently. It seems to me these xul files need to be updated for the recent XUL
tag name changes, cc'ing blake who can give some pointers on that. Also, since
this is an extension, shouldn't this be going into its own jar file in its own
subdirectories (e.g. comm/content/p3p/, en-US/locale/en-US/p3p/)?

When I created my own jar file for the cookie and wallet stuff, super-review
complained saying that we shouldn't be creating additional jar files and should
put this into the existing comm.jar and en-US.jar files. He said the jar files
are only a packaging issue so there's nothing wrong with putting things from the
extensions directory into the common jar files. Go figure.

I very much prefer for wallet and all other extensions to get there own jars.
If we can't handle localization of individual components then we have a serious
problem.
p3p needs its own jars. I for one do not want to download a single bit of p3p
support.

In a chrome .jar file any subdirectory with its own contents.rdf could be
mechanically moved from .jar to .jar with simple build (and install script)
changes to reference the new location. There's no conflict between creating a
separate chrome structure for some feature and for now putting it in one of the
existing chrome .jars for simplicity.
At the very least make the P3P chrome movable in this way, and then people can
fight out the packaging issues elsewhere.

I am trying to make the Mac project files. p3pIDL.mcp seems to be ok, but the
normal p3p.mcp will not compile - cannot file header files like nsCOM.h. I have
no idea why, the include paths seem to be OK. Also, I am not sure what extra
libs needs to be included in the project (besides the .cpp files in the p3p
dir). Also I am not sure what needs to be done with the resource files. So some
help would be needed here.
I attached the diff (could not get unified diff to work) to make the Mac build
script changes. These changes would make p3p not be built by default, as it
should be to begin with.

Just a comment on the packaging issue :-
packaging is completely independent of the underlying code. We collect all the
packages that we ship with by default in our distribution together into the
comm.jar file, this includes chrome that CAN NOT be deselected during the
install process, while chrome that can receives its own jars (mailnews,
chatzilla, etc). There is ZERO POINT creating new jar files for chrome that
will always be present in our distribution, and it adds to the file clutter
that we lay down on disk. This does not stop other distributions from
repackaging as they see fit, should they choose to offer installation options
or remove a feature completely, however it is appropriate for our distribution
to try and use as few jar files as possible, rather than balkanizing the front
end into hundreds of jar files for every add-on.

|  | |

Another reason for creating .jars would be to save startup time for chrome that
isn't used often since the open-jar time spent is directly proportional to the
number of files in each archive.
Of course the big losers on that front are the skin and locale jars which
contain everything whether used or not. I'm not recommending
further balkanization of the chrome .jars at this point, but it might be
interesting to measure what time could be saved by being smarter.

I've attached the necessary source changes to build P3P support on Mac.
Most of it is changing #include <blah.h> to #include "blah.h". Angle
brackets are used to indicate system headers on Mac. Also some minor
changes to handle PRTime correctly. I've also attached a patch to the Mac
build system so that it has a p3p build option. The third patch I just
attached contains the changes for the new XUL syntax, someone needs
to check these and the fourth patch groups most of the previously
attached patches to source outside of mozilla/extensions/p3p (in
text/plain, not zipped \*ugh\*). With this, I can use P3P somewhat in Mozilla,
though I haven't found a site for which it really works (seems related to the
version of the spec it supports). Also, the privacy icon doesn't display most
of the time, because some of the gifs that are in the cvs are broken and
customizing the settings in the prefs doesn't work either.

I'm still opposed to this. Microsoft's actions appear to be anticompetitive and
are probably just as illegal as some of their previous actions. That should not
be the reason for something to be added to mozilla's tree.

Probably done for anticompetitive reasons, but I don't see how supporting a
standard is really anticompetitive.
Anyways, what do you mean "still" opposed to this? I only saw one complaint

that what you're against, or are you against adding P3P in general?

Maybe a more thorough approach would be beneficial? P3P is all fine and dandy,
but it leaves issues to address.
<http://www.kcoyle.net/response.html>
"It is interesting to note that these more privacy-oriented cookie controls,
although not at all complex as a technology, are not available in the browsers
themselves. Had they been included in the primary Web browsers and been in wide
use over the last five years, the Net would be different to what it is today in
terms of personal privacy. We have to conclude that the developers of browsers
made a conscious decision not to include privacy-oriented cookie controls
because it might interfere with the economic model of many Web sites, including
their own. It is also significant that the P3P privacy policy interaction
relates solely to the immediate Web page that is visited. This means that P3P
does not include the gathering of data through banner ad cookies and thus
ignores the vast majority of privacy invasions on the Web."

"We have to conclude that the developers of browsers made a conscious decision
not to include privacy-oriented cookie controls[...]"
What are we to make of the fact that even NS4.x had "no cookies from secondary
servers" as a pref (though not pref-panel) option more than 5 years ago, then?
Curious.

Hi,
As the co-developer of a GPL'ed CMS / Web publication system (named SPIP), I
would like to know how our individual / non-profit users (i.e. webmasters) are
expected to be able to fill a bunch of complex administrative XML stuff if they
want our authentication cookies to work for them. P3P is aggressively
discriminative against non-corporate webmasters. Right now, if a MSIE 6 user
tells us his browser refuses the cookies, we suggest he jumps to Mozilla. If
Mozilla implements P3P by default, then the only thing we can tell them is to
set a low privacy level in their browser. A good way to promote privacy, isn't it ?
Yours
Antoine (antoine@rezo.net).

As the developer of a GPL'd CMS (Berylium) I don't think P3P is such a big
hurdle. I think the biggest problem might be lack of examples-- once you see a
few other implementations, it's not so difficult to create your own.
(<http://chxo.com/w3c/> )
The trick with a CMS is to provide a default policy that will at least get your
cookies accepted, and then allow/encourage site owners to create more
comprehensive XML policies. Sending a P3P header with a compact cookie policy
(CP="") is not so difficult.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-12

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:2.0.1/ 1.9.2.17/ 1.9.1.19)

Announced
April 28, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.19
* Firefox 3.6.17
* Firefox 4.0.1
* SeaMonkey 2.0.14
* Thunderbird 3.1.10

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### Credits

Mozilla developers Boris Zbarsky, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Michael Wu,
Nils, Scoobidiver, and Ted Mielczarek reported memory safety issues which
affected Firefox 4.

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0473)

Original Release Date: May 2, 2011

Last Revised: May 2, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-135

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) to this issue.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the HTML iframe tag. A web
page with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey displayed multiple marquee elements.
A malformed HTML document could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause SeaMonkey to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0473.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed:

| Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 | These are a low as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) and
[CVE-2011-0081](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0081.html) to these issues.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
accessible to the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0071](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0071.html) to this issue.

A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
"application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0070](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0070.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0069](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0069.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0067](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0067.html) to this issue.

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0066](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0066.html) and
[CVE-2011-0065](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0065.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1202.html) to this issue.

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:
