  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input being used in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries which can lead to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Depending on database permissions, this can also lead to complete server compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP GET request to the `/index.php?page=profile` endpoint with a crafted `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web server. No special privileges are required."
