|  | |

On 1.9.2 branch JO() from json.cpp incorrectly reuse the passed vp parameter for rooting an iterator leading to a GC hazard. The following example demonstrates this for a debug build of JS shell:
function iter() {
({});
gc();
yield 1;
}
function create\_iter() {
return iter();
}
JSON.stringify({ get o() {
var obj = {};
obj.\_\_iterator\_\_ = create\_iter;
return obj;
}});
~/m/192/js/src> ~/b/js/192dbg32/js ~/s/x.js
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
On trunk we are safe due to the conservative GC scanner.

Yes, this affects 1.9.1 - I forgot that the native JSON were introduced on that branch first.

ZDI-CAN-971: Mozilla Firefox JSON.stringify Dangling Pointer Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following
products:
Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Firefox. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious
page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within js3250.dll. In the JSON.stringify() call
chain js\_HasOwnProperty() is called with an invalid pointer. The pointer
becomes invalid due to being unrooted and garbage collection occurring.
Dereferecing of this pointer allows a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the user running the browser.
Version(s) tested: Firefox 3.6.10
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3 x86
There is a GC hazard in function |JO|. One can see that |obj| is rooted
only at |vp[0]|. Then, if there is no replacer object associated or
replacer is an array, |js\_ValueToIterator| is called returning iterator
instance at
|keySource|, where |keySource| is a pointer == |vp|. Thus |obj| becomes
unrooted while still being used as an argument in several functions'
invocations along the |JO| body.
POC triggers a jump to an invalid address in ecx, below:

Tested on Linux...
On trunk, PoC loads fine with no issues.
On 3.6.x, PoC hangs browser (throws slow script warning repeatedly).

The stack scanner in 2.0 should find obj and keep it alive (I don't crash with 4.0b7 on this test case).blocking2.0: ? → ---

We could probably backport the stack scanner to 3.6 with reasonable effort and pretty limited risk.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-03

## Use-after-free error in JSON.stringify

Announced
March 1, 2011
Reporter
regenrecht
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.17
* Firefox 3.6.14
* SeaMonkey 2.0.12

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative that a method used
by `JSON.stringify` contained a use-after-free error in
which a currently in-use pointer was freed and subsequently
dereferenced. This could lead to arbitrary code execution if an
attacker was able to store malicious code in the freed section of
memory.

Mozilla developer **Igor Bukanov** also independently
discovered and reported this issue two weeks after the initial
report was received.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0310)

Original Release Date: April 11, 2011

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-093

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox sanitized HTML content in extensions.
If an extension loaded or rendered malicious content using the
ParanoidFragmentSink class, it could fail to safely display the content,
causing Firefox to execute arbitrary JavaScript with the privileges of the
user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2010-1585](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2010-1585.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled dialog boxes. An attacker could
use this flaw to create a malicious web page that would present a blank
dialog box that has non-functioning buttons. If a user closes the dialog
box window, it could unexpectedly grant the malicious web page elevated
privileges.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0051](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0051.html) to this issue.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0053](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0053.html),
[CVE-2011-0055](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0055.html),
[CVE-2011-0058](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0058.html) and
[CVE-2011-0062](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0062.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the way Firefox handled malformed JavaScript. A
website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox to execute that
JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0054](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0054.html),
[CVE-2011-0056](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0056.html) and
[CVE-2011-0057](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0057.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0061](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0061.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled plug-ins that perform HTTP
requests. If a plug-in performed an HTTP request, and the server sent a 307
redirect response, the plug-in was not notified, and the HTTP request was
forwarded. The forwarded request could contain custom headers, which could
result in a Cross Site Request Forgery attack.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0059](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0059.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2010-1585 CVE-2011-0051 CVE-2011-0053 CVE-2011-0054 CVE-2011-0055 CVE-2011-0056 CVE-2011-0057 CVE-2011-0058 CVE-2011-0059 CVE-2011-0061 CVE-2011-0062 | These are a Low for MN, MSS, PS, SM and SMGR as it would require non-standrard direct user interaction. There is no risk to IQ and CS1000 as firefox is not installed, only xulrunner. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.
