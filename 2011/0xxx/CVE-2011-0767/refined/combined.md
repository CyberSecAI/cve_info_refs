How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Imperva SecureSphere management GUI contains an XSS vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#567774

Original Release Date: 2011-05-31 | Last Revised: 2011-05-31

---

### Overview

An XSS vulnerability exists in the Imperva SecureSphere management GUI.

### Description

| Dell SecureWorks' [SWRX-2011-001 advisory](http://www.secureworks.com/research/advisories/SWRX-2011-001/) states:  *"**A vulnerability exists in Imperva SecureSphere due to improper validation of user-controlled input. User-controllable input is not properly sanitized for illegal or malicious content prior to being stored and later returned to an administrator in dynamically generated web content. Remote attackers could leverage this issue to conduct persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When the malicious content is viewed, arbitrary script or HTML code injected into the affected database field will be executed in the SecureSphere administrative user’s browser session in the security context of the SecureSphere administrative GUI. Successful exploitation may aid an attacker in retrieving session cookies, stealing recently submitted data, or launching further attacks."*Additional details can be found in Imperva's advisory, [Imperva Security Response for CVE-2011-0767](http://www.imperva.com/resources/adc/adc_advisories_response_secureworks.html). |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to execute arbitrary script in the security context of the user's browser session accessing the management GUI. |
| --- |

### Solution
