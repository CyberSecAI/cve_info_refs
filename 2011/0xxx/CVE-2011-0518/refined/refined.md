      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'system' parameter within the 'index.php' file. Specifically, the application uses the 'getInputString' function to retrieve the 'system' parameter value, which is then directly concatenated into a file path without sufficient validation. This allows an attacker to control the included file.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI): The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary files from the server's filesystem. By manipulating the 'system' parameter, an attacker can cause the application to include files outside of the intended 'core/plugs/' directory.",
         "Remote Code Execution (RCE): By combining the LFI vulnerability with the ability to inject code into log files or blog comments, the attacker can achieve RCE. Code injection via these methods writes a PHP webshell to the server that can then be executed via LFI."
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to read sensitive files on the server (LFI) and execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to complete compromise of the system (RCE). This can result in data theft, defacement, or the use of the server for further malicious activity.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "HTTP GET Request: The LFI vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious HTTP GET request to the vulnerable 'index.php' file, manipulating the 'system' parameter to include a file path.",
        "HTTP GET Request via Log Poisoning: The RCE is achieved by injecting PHP code into the Apache access logs via a crafted GET request, then including the poisoned log via LFI to execute the code.",
        "HTTP POST Request via Blog Comment Injection: The RCE is achieved by submitting a malicious comment to the blog post that includes PHP code, then including the resulting comment file via LFI to execute the code."
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application. The attacker must be able to inject into either log files or blog comments to gain RCE."
