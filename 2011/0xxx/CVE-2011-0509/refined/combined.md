How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vaadin 6.4.9 is a maintenance release for Vaadin 6.4. It contains several important fixes.

Please see the [list of fixed issues in Vaadin 6.4.9](http://dev.vaadin.com/query?status=closed&resolution=fixed&order=id&milestone=Vaadin+6.4.9&type=!task)
for more details. Problem fixes and enhancements planned for upcoming
releases can be found from the [Vaadin Roadmap](http://dev.vaadin.com/roadmap) in Vaadin Trac.

An outline of enhancements introduced in Vaadin 6.4 is given in the [Release Notes for Vaadin 6.4.0](http://vaadin.com/download/release/6.4/6.4.0/release-notes.html).

Problem fixes and enhancements planned for upcoming releases can be found in the [Vaadin Roadmap](http://dev.vaadin.com/roadmap) in Vaadin Trac.

As always, when upgrading from an earlier version, you should recompile any custom
widget sets and refresh your project in Eclipse. If you are upgrading from earlier than
6.3.0, notice that Vaadin 6.4 uses GWT 2.0 (included in the installation package). See
[General Upgrade Notes](#upgrading) for more details on upgrading.

## Security fixes

* Fixed an XSS vulnerability on the index-page ([#6257](http://dev.vaadin.com/ticket/6257))

## General Upgrade Notes

When upgrading from an earlier version of the Vaadin library, you should always do the following:

1. Install the new Vaadin JAR to your project

* If using the Vaadin Plugin in Eclipse, download and select the new version in project preferences.

3. Install new GWT JARs if the GWT version has changed

* The Eclipse plugin will automatically download the new GWT and update launch configurations and the project build path when you update the Vaadin version.

5. If you have custom widget sets, recompile them with the new Vaadin library using the included GWT compiler
6. If using the Eclipse IDE:
   1. Refresh the Eclipse project by selecting the project folder and pressing **F5**
   2. Restart the application server

Using the Vaadin project facet in the Eclipse IDE does the steps 1 and 2 automatically.

## Upgrading from Vaadin 6.3

The following changes can break backward compatibility in applications
using Vaadin 6.3 or earlier:

* In **AbsoluteLayout.ComponentPosition** ([#5311](http://dev.vaadin.com/ticket/5311)):

  + The setters and getters of floating-point properties now use **Float**
    instead of float to allow null values for indicating "unset"
    values. This change can cause compile-time errors, which you may need
    to solve with proper casts.
  + The setCSSString() now resets attributes not present
    in the given parameter to their unset state, which may cause change
    application behavior without causing any compile- or runtime-errors.
* In the rare case that you have extended the **DefaultWidgetSet** class, please notice that earlier, the custom entry point was defined in the .gwt.xml file as follows:
  ```
      <entry-point class="com.example.MyExtendedWidgetSet" />
  ```
  Now you need to write as follows:
  ```
      <replace-with class="com.example.MyExtendedWidgetSet">
          <when-type-is class="com.vaadin.terminal.gwt.client.WidgetSet" />
      </replace-with>
  ```

## Upgrading from Vaadin 6.0 or 6.1

The way how widget sets are defined was simplified in Vaadin 6.2.
Existing projects, where custom widgets (a custom widget set) are used,
must be migrated when upgrading to Vaadin 6.2 or later. Projects where
the default widget set is used do not need migration. For most projects
this should be a quite painless upgrade.

For applications where custom widgets are used (also applicable to widget projects):

* Remove the *getTag()* method from all components and replace it with a @ClientWidget(VClientSideWidget.class) annotation. Tag names are no longer used to map the server-side and client-side part of the component. This is done automatically using the @ClientWidget annotation.
* Remove the WidgetSet.java file. This file is no longer needed as the mapping between the server- and the client-side is done automatically using @ClientWidget.

If you are using widgets from another project (typically in a separate JAR file):

* Acquire a new JAR which is compatible with Vaadin 6.4 and add it to WEB-INF/lib. The widget set compilation will automatically include the JAR in your .gwt.xml during compilation if you use the Eclipse **Compile Widget Set** button. For Ant/Maven you need to specify the location of the widget set JARs that you want to include in the application widget set.

If you package a widget set as a JAR for use in other projects:

* Replace getTag() with @ClientWidget and remove the -WidgetSet.java as described above.
* Add a "Vaadin-Widgetsets: <fully qualified name of widgetset>" (e.g. "Vaadin-Widgetsets: com.example.widgetset.mywidgetset") row to the META-INF/MANIFEST.MF of the JAR file. This enables the widget set builder to automatically detect and include the widget set in other projects.

## Instructions for Upgrading from IT Mill Toolkit 5

While the Vaadin 6 API is otherwise mostly backward-compatible with IT Mill Toolkit 5.4, the
change of the product name has made it necessary to reflect it in the Java package names,
some name prefixes, and some other details.

### Server-side Upgrade Instructions

* Java Package names have changed:

+ In all Java files using IT Mill Toolkit, rename package prefix com.itmill.toolkit → com.vaadin
+ You also need to update the web.xml deployment descriptor:

- The servlet class is now **com.vaadin.terminal.gwt.server.ApplicationServlet**.

* Changes in themes:
  + Rename WebContent/ITMILL → WebContent/VAADIN
  - If you have extracted the built-in themes and widgetsets in IT Mill Toolkit JAR to the folder to have them served statically by the server, remove the old content and re-extract from Vaadin JAR.
  - This may require changes to build scripts for custom widgetsets, as well as to any code that relies on the old naming (it is discouraged but possible).+ The new "reindeer" theme is the default theme in Vaadin; the old
    "default" theme in IT Mill Toolkit 5 has been renamed as "runo"
  - There is no longer a theme with name "default"
  - In your custom theme, replace:

    |  | @import "../default/styles.css"; |
    | --- | --- |
    | → | @import "../reindeer/styles.css"; | if you wish to use the new default theme, |
    | or → | @import "../runo/styles.css"; | if you wish to use the old default theme. |
  - Use the new default theme with setTheme("reindeer") and the old one with setTheme("runo").+ CSS class names now start with "v-" prefix instead of "i-"
  - Search and replace ".i-" → ".v-" in custom themes* Embedding Vaadin applications in web pages:
  + The name of the JavaScript variable used for launching applications has changed from "itmill.toolkitConfigurations" → "vaadin.vaadinConfigurations"* Other changes in naming:
  + Rename references to translateToolkitUri() → translateVaadinUri() method in **ApplicationConnection** class.

### Client-side Upgrade Instructions

The following changes are relevant only if you have developed or integrated custom
client-side widgets with Google Web Toolkit (GWT).

* GWT 2.0 is required for compiling custom widgets (optional)

+ You need to upgrade GWT
+ The GWT Compiler class name has changed:

- Replace com.google.gwt.dev.GWTCompiler → com.google.gwt.dev.Compiler in your widget set build script (Ant) or launch configuration (Eclipse).
- Replace the output directory argument for the compiler with the new WAR output argument: -out → -war. The directory parameter for the argument remains unchanged.

* The "**I**" (IT Mill) prefix in client-side widget classes has been changed to "**V**" (Vaadin), for example: **IButton** → **VButton**.
* Rename **IToolkitOverlay** → **VOverlay**

## Notes and Limitations for Google App Engine

The following instructions and limitations apply when you run a Vaadin application
under the Google App Engine.

* Applications must use **GAEApplicationServlet** instead of
  **ApplicationServlet** in web.xml.
* Session support must be enabled in appengine-web.xml:

  ```
      <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>
  ```
* Avoid using the session for storage, usual App Engine limitations apply (no
  synchronization, i.e, unreliable).
* Vaadin uses memcache for mutex, the key is of the form
  \_vmutex<sessionid>.
* The Vaadin **WebApplicationContext** class is serialized separately into memcache
  and datastore; the memcache key is \_vac<sessionid> and the datastore
  entity kind is \_vac with identifiers of the type \_vac<sessionid>.
* DO NOT update application state when serving an **ApplicationResource** (e.g **ClassResource**.*getStream()*).
* AVOID (or be very careful when) updating application state in a
  **TransactionListener** or a **HttpServletRequestListener** - they are called even when the
  application is not locked and won't be serialized (e.g **ApplicationResource**), and
  changes can thus go missing (it should be safe to update things that can be safely discarded
  later - i.e valid only for the current request)
* The application remains locked during uploads - a progress bar is not possible

## Important known problems in Vaadin 6.4.9

* [#1155](http://dev.vaadin.com/ticket/1155):
  Uncompressing the installation package fails in Windows if using the
  default Zip uncompression. Uncompression gives (in Windows Vista) an
  error message about too long filenames, and a more obscure message in
  other versions of Windows. Workaround: use [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) or some other good unzip
  program for Windows.

For other known problems, see open tickets at developer site [dev.vaadin.com](http://dev.vaadin.com/).

## Requirements

Vaadin is available for the following operating systems:

* Windows (see the Zip installation notice above)
* Linux
* Mac OS X Tiger (mac) or Leopard (leopard)
* Other UNIX operating systems, such as Sun Solaris

Vaadin supports Java Servlet API 2.3 and later versions and should work with
any Java application server that conforms to the standard. It supports the following
application servers:

* Apache Tomcat, version 4.1 or later
* BEA WebLogic® Server, version 9.2 or later
* IBM WebSphere® Application Server, version 6.1 or later
* JBoss Application Server, version 3.2.8 or later
* Jetty, version 5 or later
* Glassfish, version 2 or later

Vaadin supports the following browsers for using the applications made with
it:

* Mozilla Firefox 3
* Internet Explorer releases 6, 7, and 8
* Safari 3, 4 and 5
* Opera 10
* Google Chrome 5

The support for browsers follows the support by GWT. The browsers are supported on both
Windows and Mac, if available. Firefox is supported also on Linux. There may be differences between the
exact versions of the supported browsers that may cause incompatibility with applications
made with Vaadin.

The following browsers are not supported but have been found to
work to a large degree:

* Safari 2
* Firefox 2
* Older versions of Google Chrome
* iPhone (firmware 2.2)
* Midori (0.1.2)
* Epiphany (2.22.3), Galeon, and other Gecko-based browsers. Also WebKit-based Epiphany (2.22.3) works.
* Konqueror 4.2 (3.5.x does not work)
* Nokia Internet Tablet N800 and N810 (ITOS 2008, Opera-based browser).

The reported versions are those that have been tested, though other versions may work
as well.

Nokia E-series phones, such as E90, have been known to work with older versions, but
not with Vaadin 6. Links, Lynx, and other text-based browsers do not
work.
