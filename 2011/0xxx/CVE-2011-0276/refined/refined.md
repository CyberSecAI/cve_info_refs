    "related": true,
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Performance Insight Server. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific vulnerability is due to a hidden account present within the com.trinagy.security.XMLUserManager Java class. Using this account a malicious user can access the com.trinagy.servlet.HelpManagerServlet class. This is defined within the piweb.jar file installed with Performance Insight. This class exposes a doPost() method which an attacker can use to upload malicious files to the server. Accessing these files can then lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
    "root_cause": "A hidden account within the `com.trinagy.security.XMLUserManager` Java class allows access to the `com.trinagy.servlet.HelpManagerServlet` class.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Backdoor account",
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Arbitrary code execution"
     ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable server with SYSTEM user privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the vulnerable server.",
      "Use of the hidden account credentials to access the HelpManagerServlet"
      ,"File upload via the doPost method.",
      "Accessing the uploaded malicious files to trigger code execution."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the server and the knowledge of the hidden account's credentials (username: hch908v, password: z6t0j$+i)."
