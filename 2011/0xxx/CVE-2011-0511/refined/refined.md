{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The 'id' parameter in the com_allcinevid component is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification or complete takeover of the application/database.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting malicious HTTP GET requests with manipulated 'id' parameters.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable component and understand the behavior of the SQL queries."
