  "vulnerability_details": {
    "CVE-2011-0887": {
      "root_cause": "The Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateways (D3G-CCR) use a predictable value for session validation. The epoch time of session start is stored as the 'userid' cookie.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Weak session management",
        "Predictable session IDs"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially bypass authentication by brute-forcing valid session IDs. While sessions expire within 10 minutes, the attack window can be exploited with other techniques.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the gateway's web management portal"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with custom cookies to the gateway. No prior authentication is needed"
    }
  }
