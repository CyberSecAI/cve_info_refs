Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-0149:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Apple's WebKit library parses a specially formatted HTML file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A dangling pointer is called when parsing a particular HTML element that also defines the namespace of the document. This pointer is consistent but unmapped in memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If an attacker can get code loaded at the unmapped address, it can lead to arbitrary code execution under the context of the application using WebKit.
- This could result in the unexpected termination of the application or allow the attacker to gain control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit it over a network.
- User interaction is required, as the target must visit a malicious webpage or open a specially crafted HTML file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious HTML page or file that triggers the dangling pointer vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to lure the victim into opening the malicious content using the vulnerable WebKit library.

**Additional Details from ZDI Advisory:**
- The vulnerability is within how the application parses an HTML file.
- The specific element parsed has a namespace declaration
- The dangling pointer is consistent, but unmapped.

This vulnerability was fixed in iTunes 10.2 and iOS 4.3.
