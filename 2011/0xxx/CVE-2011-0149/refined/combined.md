# Advisory Details

March 2nd, 2011
## Apple Webkit Root HTMLBRElement Style Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-100ZDI-CAN-969

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-0149](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0149) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 9.0, [AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Apple](http://www.apple.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [WebKit](http://webkit.org/) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['10884']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Apple's Webkit Library. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within how the application parses a specially formatted HTML file. When parsing a particular element that also defines the namespace of the document, the library will call a dangling pointer which is consistent but unmapped. Due to this being unmapped, if an attacker can get code loaded at that address this can can lead to code execution under the context of the application. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Apple has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4554> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-10-18 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2011-03-02 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
