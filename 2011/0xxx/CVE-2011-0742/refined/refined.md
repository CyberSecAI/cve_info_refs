Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-0742:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow within the Access Point process (`ZfHIPCnd.exe`) of Novell ZENworks Handheld Management.
- The application copies data of arbitrary size from a packet into a statically sized buffer without proper size validation. This occurs during the initialization of the buffer, leading to the overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: The application does not validate the size of the incoming data before copying it into a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- The code execution occurs in the context of the application, which could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges or compromise the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
- Attackers can send a specially crafted network packet to the vulnerable application listening on TCP port 2400 by default.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target system, specifically TCP port 2400.
- The attacker does not need any form of authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is associated with ZDI-11-026 and ZDI-CAN-1071.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID 10792.
- The vulnerability was reported by Junaid Bohio and AbdulAziz Hariri.
- A patch is available from Novell (Micro Focus).
