Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `PRTestCreation` and `TelePresenceReportAction` components of Cisco Unified Operations Manager (CuOM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `CCMs` parameter of `PRTestCreation.do` and the `ccm` parameter of `TelePresenceReportAction.do`. Specifically, a single quote (') character allows injection of SQL commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database Access:** Exploiting the SQL injection could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of the application's database.
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database, including user credentials or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote with Authentication:** The vulnerabilities are accessible remotely, however it appears that authentication is required for accessing the vulnerable endpoints.
- **HTTP GET Request:** The exploit utilizes HTTP GET requests, injecting malicious SQL code through URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Cisco Unified Operations Manager server.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a valid and authenticated user.

**Technical Details:**
- The report details that a single quote can be used to trigger a SQL injection.
- Specifically for `PRTestCreation.do`, the parameter `CCMs` is vulnerable.
- Specifically for `TelePresenceReportAction.do`, the parameter `ccm` is vulnerable.
- The exploit examples use a `waitfor delay` command to confirm the SQL injection is working (blind injection), without revealing direct data.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in Cisco Unified Operations Manager (CuOM) versions 8.0 and 8.5, and potentially other versions.
- The provided content also mentions other vulnerabilities (XSS, directory traversal) in the same system, but those are not related to CVE-2011-0960 and are associated with different CVEs.
