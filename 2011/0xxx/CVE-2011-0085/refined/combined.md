# USN-1149-1: Firefox and Xulrunner vulnerabilities

22 June 2011

Multiple Vulnerabilities were fixed in Firefox and Xulrunner

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - safe and easy web browser from Mozilla
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](/security/cves?package=xulrunner-1.9.2) - XUL + XPCOM application runner

## Details

Multiple memory vulnerabilities were discovered in the browser rendering

engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2364](/security/CVE-2011-2364), [CVE-2011-2365](/security/CVE-2011-2365),

[CVE-2011-2374](/security/CVE-2011-2374), [CVE-2011-2376](/security/CVE-2011-2376))

Martin Barbella discovered that under certain conditions, viewing a XUL

document while JavaScript was disabled caused deleted memory to be

accessed. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2373](/security/CVE-2011-2373))

Jordi Chancel discovered a vulnerability on multipart/x-mixed-replace

images due to memory corruption. An attacker could potentially use this to

crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2377](/security/CVE-2011-2377))

Chris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow vulnerability

in JavaScript Arrays. An attacker could potentially use this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2371](/security/CVE-2011-2371))

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered. An attacker could

potentially use these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0083](/security/CVE-2011-0083), [CVE-2011-0085](/security/CVE-2011-0085), [CVE-2011-2363](/security/CVE-2011-2363))

David Chan discovered that cookies did not honor same-origin conventions.

This could potentially lead to cookie data being leaked to a third party.

([CVE-2011-2362](/security/CVE-2011-2362))

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [3.6.18+build2+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/3.6.18%2Bbuild2%2Bnobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1)
* [xulrunner-1.9.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/xulrunner-1.9.2)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0885)

Original Release Date: July 19, 2011

Last Revised: April 5, 2012

Number: ASA-2011-207

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in Firefox. A web page
containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
Firefox to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that Firefox could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0885.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya IQ | 4.x, 5.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Message Networking | 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to Messaging Storage Server 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | None | Upgrade to Presence Services 6.1.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | None | Upgrade to Session Manager 6.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.x, 6.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | This is a low risk for Message Networking and Messaging Storage Server as Firefox usage is not standard functionality. There is no risk for IQ, Presence Services, Session Manager and System Manager because Firefox is not installed by default. The xulrunner package is installed and updated per the specific product actions above. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-23

## Multiple dangling pointer vulnerabilities

Announced
June 21, 2011
Reporter
regenrecht
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.18
* Thunderbird 3.1.11

### Description

Security researcher **regenrecht** reported via
TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative two instances of code which
modifies SVG element lists failed to account for changes made to the
list by user-supplied callbacks before accessing list elements. If a
user-supplied callback deleted such an object, the element-modifying
code could wind up accessing deleted memory and potentially executing
attacker-controlled memory.

regenrecht also reported via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative
that a XUL document could force the nsXULCommandDispatcher to remove
all command updaters from the queue, including the one currently in
use. This could result in the execution of deleted memory which an
attacker could use to run arbitrary code on a victim's computer.

Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1 and newer were not affected by
these issues.

3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of MozillaFirefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0888)

Original Release Date: July 11, 2011

Last Revised: July 11, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-201

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
SeaMonkey to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause SeaMonkey
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that SeaMonkey could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0888.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | Low risk as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

ZDI-CAN-1203: Mozilla Firefox nsXULCommandDispatcher Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Firefox. User interaction is required to
exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within nsXULCommandDispatcher.cpp. During a NS\_XUL\_COMMAND\_UPDATE event dispatch, the user is able to force command
dispatcher to remove all the updaters in the mUpdaters chain including the one that is currently in use. As a result, the local variable updater becomes a stale pointer and updater->mNext refers to memory previously freed. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution in the context of the browser.
Version(s) tested: 3.6.16
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3
dispatcher-use-after-free1.xul results in the following crash:
(700.4b0): Access violation - code c0000005 (!!! second chance !!!)

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
