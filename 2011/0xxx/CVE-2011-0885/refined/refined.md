{
  "CVE-2011-0885": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateways have a static administrative login of \"mso\" with the password of \"D0nt4g3tme\". These credentials are not provided during installation and users are not prompted to change them.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Static, default credentials",
    "Impact of exploitation": "With these default credentials, internal attackers can modify device configurations to leverage more significant attacks, including redirection of DNS requests, creation of a remote VPN termination point, and modification of NAT entries. The attacker gains access to the web interface for management, as well as a telnet interface that provides shell access to the device with root privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the device's management interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be on the same network as the device, or have access to the device's management interface."
