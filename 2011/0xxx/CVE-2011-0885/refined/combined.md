Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2011-002:
Vulnerabilities in Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateways
(D3G-CCR)

https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2011-002.txt

Published: 2011-02-04
Version: 1.0

Vendor: Comcast (http://comcast.com)
Product: Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateway - D3G-CCR
Version affected:  Versions prior to 1.4.0.49.2

Product description:
The Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateway provides end-user termination of
cable internet services for Comcast Business Class customers with enhanced
services including Network Address Translation (NAT), firewalling, and
Virtual Private Network (VPN) termination.

Finding 1: Static Credentials
CVE: CVE-2011-0885

All D3G-CCR gateways provided by Comcast have an administrative
login of "mso" with the password of "D0nt4g3tme".  These passwords
are not provided as a part of the installation of the device and are
not recommended to be changed, thus the majority of users are unaware
of the default configuration.

With these default credentials, internal attackers can modify device
configurations to leverage more significant attacks, including redirection
of DNS requests, creation of a remote VPN termination point, and
modification of NAT entries.  These credentials provide access to the web
interface for management, as well as a telnet interface that provides shell
access to the device.  The mso login provides shell as UID 0 (root).

Finding 2: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CVE: CVE-2011-0886
D3G-CCR gateways provided by Comcast permit CSRF attacks against
numerous management pages allowing an attacker to embed in a webpage a
malicious request against the gateway's management interface.  Through
this, an attacker can modify device configuration and enable remote
administration via a telnet shell and http.

The following Proof of Concept (PoC) connects to the gateway, logs in,
modifies the remote administration to allow any user to connect externally,
and modifies the DNS information.

</html>

If the PoC was embedded in any web page the targeted user visited while
logged into the device, the attacker would be provided remote
administration in to the gateway device include a telnet shell.  This would
allow the attacker to redirect traffic to a malicious end-point.

Finding 3: Weak Session Management
CVE: CVE-2011-0887
D3G-CCR gateways provided by Comcast utilize a predictable value to
validate the active web management portal session.  The epoch time of
beginning of the session is stored as a cookie labeled "userid".  This
provides a predictable range of session IDs that can be brute-forced.

The following PoC attempts to brute force the session IDs by requesting the
admin page with an incrementing cookie and determining whether it wants to
redirect to login.asp.

## d3g-session-poc.sh

#!/bin/bash
start=1267604160
end=1267605960
for (( i=$start; i<=$end; i++)) do if [ `curl -sb userid=$i
http://10.1.10.1/admin/index.asp | grep -c login.asp` -lt
"1" ] then echo "Session ID Found:  $i"
fi
if [ $(($i % 100)) -eq "0" ]
then echo "Currently at $i"
fi
done

Through this, an attacker can brute-force the possible valid session IDs.
Sessions do by default expire within 10 minutes, thus the attack window is
limited but can be leveraged with other attack methods.

Vendor Response:
These issues have been addressed as of version 1.4.0.49.2

Remediation Steps:
In order to determine if the correct version is installed, users should
view the "About" link in the management interface. Versions 1.4.0.49.2 and
above have been corrected.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Trustwave's SpiderLabs Security Advisory TWSL2011-001:
Vulnerabilities in Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateways
(SMCD3G-CCR)
https://www.trustwave.com/spiderlabs/advisories/TWSL2011-002.txt
Published: 2011-02-04
Version: 1.0
Vendor: Comcast (http://comcast.com) and SMC (http://www.smc.com)
Product: Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateway - SMCD3G-CCR
Version affected: Versions prior to 1.4.0.49.2
Product description:
The Comcast DOCSIS 3.0 Business Gateway provides end-user termination of
cable internet services for Comcast Business Class customers with enhanced
services including Network Address Translation (NAT), firewalling, and
Virtual Private Network (VPN) termination.
Credit: Zack Fasel and Matthew Jakubowski of Trustwave's SpiderLabs
Finding 1: Static Credentials
CVE: CVE-2011-0885
All SMCD3G-CCR gateways provided by Comcast have an administrative
login of "mso" with the password of "D0nt4g3tme". These passwords
are not provided as a part of the installation of the device and are
not recommended to be changed, thus the majority of users are unaware
of the default configuration.
With these default credentials, internal attackers can modify device
configurations to leverage more significant attacks, including redirection
of DNS requests, creation of a remote VPN termination point, and
modification of NAT entries. These credentials provide access to the web
interface for management, as well as a telnet interface that provides shell
access to the device. The mso login provides shell as UID 0 (root).
Finding 2: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CVE: CVE-2011-0886
SMCD3G-CCR gateways provided by Comcast permit CSRF attacks against
numerous management pages allowing an attacker to embed in a webpage a
malicious request against the gateway's management interface. Through
this, an attacker can modify device configuration and enable remote
administration via a telnet shell and http.
The following Proof of Concept (PoC) connects to the gateway, logs in,
modifies the remote administration to allow any user to connect externally,
and modifies the DNS information.

</body>
</html>
If the PoC was embedded in any web page the targeted user visited while
logged into the device, the attacker would be provided remote
administration in to the gateway device include a telnet shell. This would
allow the attacker to redirect traffic to a malicious end-point.
Finding 3: Weak Session Management
CVE: CVE-2011-0887
SMCD3G-CCR gateways provided by Comcast utilize a predictable value to
validate the active web management portal session. The epoch time of
beginning of the session is stored as a cookie labeled "userid". This
provides a predictable range of session IDs that can be brute-forced.
The following PoC attempts to brute force the session IDs by requesting the
admin page with an incrementing cookie and determining whether it wants to
redirect to login.asp.
## smcd3g-session-poc.sh
#!/bin/bash
start=1267604160
end=1267605960
for (( i=$start; i<=$end; i++)) do if [ `curl -sb userid=$i
http://10.1.10.1/admin/index.asp | grep -c login.asp` -lt
"1" ] then echo "Session ID Found: $i"
fi
if [ $(($i % 100)) -eq "0" ]
then echo "Currently at $i"
fi
done
Through this, an attacker can brute-force the possible valid session IDs.
Sessions do by default expire within 10 minutes, thus the attack window is
limited but can be leveraged with other attack methods.
Vendor Response:
These issues have been addressed as of version 1.4.0.49.2
Remediation Steps:
In order to determine if the correct version is installed, users should
view the "About" link in the management interface. Versions 1.4.0.49.2 and
above have been corrected.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
