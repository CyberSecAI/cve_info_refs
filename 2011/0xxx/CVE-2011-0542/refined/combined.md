Subject: CVE request: fuse

Hello,

A few more fixes have made their way to FUSE to prevent TOCTTOU symlink
attacks. An unprivileged user was able to unmount arbitrary mounts:

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=bf5ffb5fd8558bd799791834def431c0cee5a11f>

Could we please get one or more CVE numbers for them?

Thanks,

Marc.

Sorry for the dealy, some other things popped up :(

I'm going to assign 3 IDs. These look like they maybe could be combined,
but I'd rather not try to just to have a big split later on when we find
out various versions are affected in different ways.

Sure!

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=bf5ffb5fd8558bd799791834def431c0cee5a11f>

Fuse tries to mount a directory without resolving symlinks, and then
tries to update mtab. If it couldn't update mtab, it would unmount the
directory while resolving symlinks this time, resulting in a different
directory being unmounted.

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=1e7607ff89c65b005f69e27aeb1649d624099873>

This prevents local users from changing the location of the current
directory from under fuse using a timing attack.

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=cbd3a2a84068aae6e3fe32939d88470d712dbf47>

Fuse uses the --no-canonicalize mount option to prevent a symlink attack
on the mount point written to mtab. For backwards compatibility reasons,
it would fallback to using mount in an insecure way. This fallback could
get triggered by a user when an entry already existed in mtab.

All three of these issues allowed local users to trick fuse into
unmounting arbitrary directories.

Marc.
