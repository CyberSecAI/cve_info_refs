- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `FSFindFolder()` API, when used with the `kTemporaryFolderType` flag, returns a directory that is world readable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A local information disclosure vulnerability exists because the temporary directory returned by the API is readable by any user on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user could gain access to files in the temporary directory that they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to be a local user on the affected system to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user account on the system is needed.
