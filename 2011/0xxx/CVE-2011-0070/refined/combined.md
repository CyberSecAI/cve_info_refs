## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) and
[CVE-2011-0081](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0081.html) to these issues.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
accessible to the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0071](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0071.html) to this issue.

A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
"application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0070](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0070.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0069](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0069.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0067](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0067.html) to this issue.

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0066](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0066.html) and
[CVE-2011-0065](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0065.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1202.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | All | None | See mitigating factors below. | Avaya IQ | 5.x | None | See mitigating factors below. || Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0.x, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0067 CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0071 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081 CVE-2011-1202 | This rated a Low for IQ, MN, MSS, PS, SMGR because no critical system processes or applications are affected This is rated a None for CS1000 and IQ because XULRunner is not used or configured and Firefox is not installed |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110323 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.16
Build Identifier: 3.6.16
By passing a malformed "application/http-index-format" response it is possible to cause a double delete in nsDirIndexParser leading to application crash and potential arbitrary code execution.
Details:
(All code below is from netwerk/streamconv/converters/nsDirIndexParser.cpp)
The nsDirIndexParser destructor deletes the member mFormat:
101 nsDirIndexParser::~nsDirIndexParser() {
102 delete[] mFormat;
...
This is usually fine as mFormat is either null (as it is initalised in the Init method) or a value which has been return by new in the method ParseFormat (line 206):
178 nsDirIndexParser::ParseFormat(const char\* aFormatStr) {
179 // Parse a "200" format line, and remember the fields and their
180 // ordering in mFormat. Multiple 200 lines stomp on each other.
181
182 delete[] mFormat;
183
184 // Lets find out how many elements we have.
185 // easier to do this then realloc
186 const char\* pos = aFormatStr;
187 unsigned int num = 0;
188 do {
189 while (\*pos && nsCRT::IsAsciiSpace(PRUnichar(\*pos)))
190 ++pos;
191
192 ++num;
193 // There are a maximum of six allowed header fields (doubled plus
194 // terminator, just in case) -- [Bug 443299](/show_bug.cgi?id=443299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate possible buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser")
195 if (num > (2 \* NS\_ARRAY\_LENGTH(gFieldTable)))
196 return NS\_ERROR\_UNEXPECTED;
197
198 if (! \*pos)
199 break;
200
201 while (\*pos && !nsCRT::IsAsciiSpace(PRUnichar(\*pos)))
202 ++pos;
203
204 } while (\*pos);
205
206 mFormat = new int[num+1];
mFormat is deleted on entry to this function on line 182.
By passing a correct 200: line (with num < 14), mFormat will be assigned the value returned by new on line 206. If another 200: line is encountered, mFormat will be deleted on 182 but not set to null. If this second 200: line has an incorrect number of header fields it will fail the check on line 195 and an error value will be return, with mFormat retaining the value which was just deleted.
When this instance of nsDirIndexParser is destroyed the destructor will be called, deleting the same mFormat which has already been deleted, leading potentially to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
A simple patch would be to set mFormat to null after it is deleted on line 182.
This issue appears to have been introduced by the fix for [Bug 443299](/show_bug.cgi?id=443299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate possible buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser") which limited the number of header fields.
\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*
I'll attach a simple python script which will generate the required "application/http-index-format" response (based on the PoC for [Bug 443299](/show_bug.cgi?id=443299 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate possible buffer overflow in nsDirIndexParser"))
Due to the nature of double delete bugs it may not crash every time and may crash with many different stack traces. I am able to reliably crash firefox here (sometimes having to mash f5 a bit, sometimes not.)
I've only tested on FF 3.6.16 32 bit Ubuntu 10.10.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
Run attached python script
navigate to localhost:8080
crash. (try with different tabs open etc to get different traces)

I don't know why you'd crash over in nsHtml5HtmlAttributes::~nsHtml5HtmlAttributes but I guess general memory corruption.
On 3.6.17pre Mac I didn't crash after a bunch of reloads, but the test page doesn't do a lot and probably didn't trigger reallocating that memory (or if it freed something used elsewhere I might not crash until some later time). I crashed immediately (fatal abort) when running with MallocScribble turned on. QA should verify this fix using MallocScribble on Mac and gflags on Windows: don't rely on multiple reloads triggering a crash by chance.blocking1.9.1: --- → ?blocking1.9.2: --- → ?

Rather than null out mFormat right after the delete, what if we delay the delete until we've decided that the new format is good?

branch patch
looks good, but have you considered making making mFormat an nsAutoArrayPtr?

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-12

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:2.0.1/ 1.9.2.17/ 1.9.1.19)

Announced
April 28, 2011
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.5.19
* Firefox 3.6.17
* Firefox 4.0.1
* SeaMonkey 2.0.14
* Thunderbird 3.1.10

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### Credits

Mozilla developers Boris Zbarsky, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Michael Wu,
Nils, Scoobidiver, and Ted Mielczarek reported memory safety issues which
affected Firefox 4.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.
