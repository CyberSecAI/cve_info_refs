Debian Security Advisory DSA-2178-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                            Florian Weimer
March 02, 2011                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : pango1.0
Vulnerability  : NULL pointer dereference
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0064

It was discovered that pango did not check for memory allocation
failures, causing a NULL pointer dereference with an adjustable
offset.  This can lead to application crashes and potentially
arbitrary code execution.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.28.3-1+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |

Looks like OOM. Do you think malloc() may return NULL for a 200mb request? Pango doesn't deal with OOM, though next version using external harfbuzz will do a fair job. Can you make sure you don't pass on strings 8388607 characters long to pango?

That's only 8-16MB of text. We should be able to handle that. Perhaps we could break up the string into pieces, like we do for shapers on other platforms, but that feels like working around a bug.
Shouldn't OOM trigger a clean abort with an obvious stack trace rather than dereferencing NULL or whatever's happening here?

Donno if realloc aborts or returns NULL these days. I can try making it try to deal with it. Let me cook a patch tonight and see.

Firefox here (x86\_64) seems to have a writable segment at 0x0060d000 (6344704).
If we break up the string, we can choose where to break it up.
How do we choose the number?

To be realistic, I don't think I get to do it anytime soon. One can try to backport the buffer malloc failure handling from hb-ng to pango, but it's not a high priority for me right now.

I'd say, 100,000 chars? I have a hard time imagining a legitimate usecase for a 100,000 chars long paragraph.

My comment was on the understanding that limiting the size of the offset from NULL to the portion of the address space that can't be modified would keep the outcome to a DoS. And I'm curious how much space we have at the beginning of the address space that can't be modified.
Though a smaller limit would also help make the OOM a little less likely, I guess. Being conservative is fine, but I'm still curious re the size of non-writeable address space, so that I know we're being conservative.
We can limit the number of characters. Is there any limit on the number of glyphs per character?

Not really. With webfonts you can exponentially expand the buffer length with a tiny tiny font. I'm actually working on such test fonts right now.

Don't think so. Large expansion can come from legitimate GSUB tables. And the OT sanitizer doesn't even support GSUB.

No; OTS does not (currently) even attempt to check/sanitize OpenType layout tables (in particular, GSUB, which is the one that could be used to generate large numbers of glyphs from a short string).
Having said that, the typical DoS (such as this one) does not directly involve generating huge numbers of \*glyphs\* but rather inserting very long \*strings\* into the document. This stresses the shaping process because we shape the entire string at once.
There's a patch in [bug 606714](/show_bug.cgi?id=606714 "RESOLVED FIXED - CoreText crash [@ TGlyphEncoder::EncodeChars] with gigantic text run") that addresses this by splitting very large strings (preferring whitespace, or at least cluster boundaries) so that we shape them in sections (about 32K chars). This is implemented in gfxFont::InitTextRun, so potentially applies to any back-end, but currently some platforms may override this method and so they'd need to handle it separately; I haven't checked the Pango case specifically.

Yes, OOM ought to be handled properly/safely, and if it's not, we ought to fix that. But we should also try to avoid passing multi-megabyte strings to shapers, as the shaping process necessarily involves buffer allocations of several times the size of the input text, and there's no realistic use-case that actually requires shaping such strings in a single operation.

Confirming based on [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=606997#c11 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash with document.write marquee loop (JS:ShellCode-FG Exploit)").
realloc() is in our code (for apps built with the default m-c configure.in at least), so I think the simplest protection from fonts with large numbers of glyphs per characters is to make realloc abort on failure.
(realloc is what is involved here and malloc isn't quite the same risk, because often malloced data is first written near the beginning of the segment leading to a safe crash.)

Using FF 3.6.13pre on Windows (where originally reported) I only get crashes due to operator new throwing on OOM. We did fix [bug 607222](/show_bug.cgi?id=607222 "RESOLVED FIXED - Interleaving document.write and appendChild can lead to duplicate text frames and overrunning of text run buffers") in Firefox 3.6.12 and this bug was filed against 3.6.11--could that be a fix?

No, I'm seeing exactly the same thing on Windows XP with 3.6.11 as originally reported. On Windows this is a sg:dos OOM bug, and basically a duplicate of several similar testcases.

On Linux, with Pango, when realloc fails on OOM, memory is then overwritten at an offset from NULL equal to the length the end of the old buffer, which could be arbitrary length depending on memory limits. That seems worse than DoS to me.

In Linux default configurations, only one page (4k) is protected from being
mapped into user address space (DEFAULT\_MMAP\_MIN\_ADDR).

AFAIK, the logic in arch\_get\_unmapped\_area\_topdown means that the next page could be used in low memory situations.

(BTW, it seems that the bottomup logic will not necessarily kick in if
mmap\_min\_addr > one page, because an unmapped area can be selected below

sizeof(hb\_internal\_glyph\_info\_t) = 20 (on 32 and 64 bit machines)
That gives us a safe limit of 4k/20 which we could round up to 205 glyphs.
Given the "new\_allocated += (new\_allocated >> 1) + 8" pattern and possible
initial values of 32 or 64, we could expect a safe SEGV for lengths of up to 227 glyphs.

If we stripped GSUB tables from downloaded fonts (which would be unfortunate),
IIUC the number of glyphs in a run would be bounded by k0 + k1 \* c, where c
is the number of characters, and we could control c, but the limit is
uncomfortably small, making this approach unappealing.
(I'd need to study the code much more carefully to calculate the constants k0 and k1, and it's complex code, so I'm not super confident about getting the numbers right.)

I think that leaves two options:
1) Write a patch to add realloc failure checking to Pango, and depend on OS
vendors to pick up the patch.
2) Make realloc abort in situations where failure might lead to this bug.

This aims to make realloc fail in the minimum set of situations and still avoid this bug.
Pango always starts writing at the next byte in the newly allocated buffer, so we get a safe SEGV if the length of the previous buffer is known to be < 4096.

CC'ing some people that I know have thoughts on infallible malloc.
Note that GLib and GObject have allocators that abort on failure (and these
libraries are used by Pango), so abort on OOM is already likely. However, the
proposed patch here increases the number of situations that lead to abort on
OOM. A don't know how to comment on how significant that increase is.

The requested size from realloc there is 58 MB.
Reducing the address space limit a touch to 2100 MB instead results in an abort during an attempted infallible allocation of 64 MB here:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/annotate/60d9203fdc35/parser/html/nsHtml5TreeBuilderCppSupplement.h#l312>

The pango realloc is harder... We should definitely wait on the outcome of tomorrow's meeting (and in particular, maybe we can have an infallible realloc even if malloc stays fallible...).

As part of that approach, we'd need to keep lengths to something like 50-100 characters. (I don't know exactly how many.) I'd need to measure how that affected peformance and it would also sometimes prevent ligatures from forming.
As the other part, we'd need to incapacitate downloaded fonts so that they didn't produce many glyphs per character. That's a particularly big issue on branches where we don't have HarfBuzz for any scripts.

Seeing how much trouble this bug is making, if a pango patch that is then left to distributions to pick up would "fix" this bug, I can be bothered to make that.

On my x86-64 machine, firefox seems to be consistently loaded with the bottom 4MB of address space unmapped (and my kernel's configured mmap\_min\_addr is 65536). Certainly this value would be different on x86 and ARM, but I wonder if we could attempt to map K bytes in the bottom of our address space with no access. Then we could choose the max-glyph constant based on the amount of no-access address space we expect to map, instead of this very small unmappable limit.

In an x86 VM of mine, dsos are the mapped at the lowest addresses (with ASLR too). But, on several trials I didn't see libs mapped below 1D8000 (1933312).

That sounds like an excellent idea in general on x86\_64 systems, where there is plenty of address space.
On 32-bit systems, address space is in short supply so it gets harder to pick a reasonable K.

Make realloc abort in situations where failure might lead to this bug
It appears that we only use pango with gtk2 and qt, which in practice implies running on the linux kernel. It seems like this patch assumes overcommit and so rare realloc failures that are visible to jemalloc. Otherwise, this would essentially make ns\*Array/ns\*String infallible with no fallible recourse. That logic seems fine to me.

Thanks, Behdad. Yes, I think we should fix this in Pango. (We're not
confident about the consequences from possible workarounds in Gecko.)
This is adapted from your HarfBuzz patch
<http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/commit/?id=a6a79df5fe2e>
The only functional change is that positions is now always allocated in
hb\_buffer\_ensure. Whether that makes any difference in practice, I don't
know.
With this patch, I get a safe abort here (as expected):

FWIW, the patch in [bug 617905](/show_bug.cgi?id=617905 "RESOLVED FIXED - refactor gfxFont::InitTextRun to make the splitting of long runs universally applicable") should mean that it is significantly more difficult to hit this issue now, as it prevents huge strings being passed to Pango for shaping in a single operation; they are broken up and shaped in sections. This will help to limit Pango's need to allocate huge working buffers.
It would still be possible to hit this, I think, but crafting an example that pushes us close enough to OOM that allocation will fail within Pango while shaping a 32K-character run (yet does not simply hit OOM elsewhere and crash safely) will be a lot more difficult and fairly specific to the exact system configuration in use.

This is probably a better question for dveditz, bsterne, or someone closer to managing the 1.9.x releases.
If its feasible for researchers to find a way to develop and exploit around the second comment in [comment 51](/show_bug.cgi?id=606997#c51 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash with document.write marquee loop (JS:ShellCode-FG Exploit)") I think we should assume some higher risk for needing to get this in to 2.0, since independent research turned up the original problem.

Do we have anyone who knows the appropriate way to notify the appropriate set of OS vendors? That sounds like the best way forward here.
If we were to land the patch here, we should probably make sure that any other browser vendors that use Pango have some notice.

Hey Dan, do we have an ETA for closing this in our own code?

I did not get any response from vendor-sec, guess I'll ping the distro guys on our own security group directly.
Is there anything to close in our own code? I'm confused about the status of [attachment 494190](/attachment.cgi?id=494190 "Make realloc abort in situations where failure might lead to this bug") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=494190&action=edit "Make realloc abort in situations where failure might lead to this bug") [[diff]](/attachment.cgi?id=494190&action=diff "Make realloc abort in situations where failure might lead to this bug") [[review]](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=606997&attachment=494190) -- it's reviewed and not obsolete, but Karl seemed to think it was worth avoiding in [comment 48](/show_bug.cgi?id=606997#c48 "RESOLVED WORKSFORME - Crash with document.write marquee loop (JS:ShellCode-FG Exploit)").

I think that question was addressed to Chris Jones, not Hofmann. I think the answer to that question is also the answer to Johnath's question.

and Red Hat agreed.

I expect there is a non-negligible number of situations where that will happen, but those may (or may not) be situations where we were about to abort, or at least badly malfunction, anyway.

Making the browser resilient to OOM DoS attacks is a big project beyond the scope of this bug IMO.

1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- hplip
Specially crafted SNMP replies could cause a buffer overflow in
hplip's sane backend (CVE-2010-4267).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3

- nbd
A buffer overflow in the mainloop function the nbd server could
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0530).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- clamav
Specially crafted VBA data in Microsoft Office documents could crash
clamav or potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code. clamav
was updated to version 0.97 to fix the issue (CVE-2011-1003).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- aaa\_base
shell meta characters in file names could cause interactive shells
to execute arbitrary commands when performing tab expansion
(CVE-2011-0468).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- flash-player
The Adobe Flash Player was updated to version 10.2.153.1 to fix a
buffer overflow. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0609).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- pango
Specially crafted font files could cause a heap corruption in
applications linked against pango (CVE-2011-0064, CVE-2011-0020).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- openssl
A malformed ClientHello message could crash servers using openssl for
communication (CVE-2011-0014).

- subversion
Remote attackers could crash an svn server by causing a NULL deref
(CVE-2011-0715).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.4
- postgresql
A buffer overflow in the intarray module potentially allowed
attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user running postgresql
(CVE-2010-4015).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- logwatch
Shell meta characters in log file names could lead to execution of
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-1018).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml files could crash applications linked against
libxml2 (CVE-2010-4494).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- quagga
Remote attackers could crash bgpd via a malformed Extended Communities or AS\_PATHLIMIT
attributes (CVE-2010-1674, CVE-2010-1675).
Affected Products: SLES9, SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-02-18 12:43:08 UTC  ``` It was discovered that pango did not check for memory reallocation failures in hb_buffer_ensure() function.  This could trigger a NULL pointer dereference in hb_buffer_add_glyph(), where possibly untrusted input is used as an index used for accessing members of the incorrectly reallocated array, resulting in the use of NULL address as the base array address.  This can result in application crash or, possibly, code execution.  It was demonstrated that it's possible to trigger this flaw in Firefox via a specially crafted web page.  Mozilla bug report (currently not public): <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606997>  Fix in the harfbuzz git: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/commit/?id=a6a79df5fe2e>  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Mozilla Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-02-18 13:07:47 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the pango package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and 6.  This issue affects the versions of the evolution28-pango package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  --  This issue affects the versions of the pango package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c7)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-23 08:57:47 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c1)) > This issue affects the versions of the pango package, as shipped with > Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 5, and 6. >  > This issue affects the versions of the evolution28-pango package, as > shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  This initial assessment was incorrect.  The issue only affects pango version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  Upstream dropped realloc failure checking code in this commit:   <http://git.gnome.org/browse/pango/commit/?id=336bb320>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-23 09:18:29 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 480386](attachment.cgi?id=480386&action=diff "Patch ported to pango") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=480386&action=edit "Patch ported to pango") Patch ported to pango  (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c0)) > Upstream patch: > [2] <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/commit/?id=a6a79df5fe2e>  Port of this harfbuzz patch to pango, by Karl Tomlinson.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-02-28 19:38:05 UTC  ``` Additional patch (in the harfbuzz git) to protect against possible integer overflow in hb_buffer_ensure:   <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/commit/?id=b5dd44e24669>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-01 10:10:56 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c10)) > Additional patch (in the harfbuzz git) to protect against possible integer > overflow in hb_buffer_ensure: >   <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/harfbuzz/commit/?id=b5dd44e24669>  Further review of the pango code confirmed that the overflow is not possible in the current versions.  In most hb_buffer_ensure calls, the requested buffer size is only 1 larger than the current number of items in the buffer (and hence at most current capacity + 1).  _hb_buffer_add_output_glyphs is the only place that may request extension larger than 1 (num_out argument).  Sequence::apply is the only place that may call that function with num_out greater than 1.  It passes substitute.len value as num_out argument, which is of unsigned short type and hence 0xffff at max.  Due to that, the loop adjusting new_allocated will not run more than once when current buffer size is large enough to possibly trigger realloc overflow after the new_allocated value increase.  On 32bit platforms, that would require current buffer size of at least 0x8888884 items, which means total memory allocation that already exceeds 2^32 memory size limit and hence is impossible.  The overflow can never happen on 64bit platforms (new_allocated * sizeof(...) is evaluated as size_t expression).  Thanks to Karl Tomlinson for the review and feedback.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c12)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-01 23:34:12 UTC  ``` This is public now via:  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/63070>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c13)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-01 23:35:14 UTC  ``` Created pango tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 681378](show_bug.cgi?id=681378 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0064 pango: missing memory reallocation failure checking in hb_buffer_ensure [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-03-01 23:43:43 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0309 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0309.html>   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=678563#c15)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-09-09 07:33:05 UTC  ``` In all the versions of qt shipped with RHEL, in the embedded harfbuzz code, hb_buffer_ensure / otl_buffer_ensure returned an error and hb_buffer_add_glyph / otl_buffer_add_glyph had a check for the error.  Hence it was not vulnerable to the realloc failure.  Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of qt shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6.   ``` |  |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# USN-1082-1: Pango vulnerabilities

2 March 2011

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [pango1.0](/security/cves?package=pango1.0) -

## Details

Marc Schoenefeld discovered that Pango incorrectly handled certain Glyph

Definition (GDEF) tables. If a user were tricked into displaying text with

a specially-crafted font, an attacker could cause Pango to crash, resulting

in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and 9.10.

([CVE-2010-0421](/security/CVE-2010-0421))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that Pango incorrectly handled certain FT\_Bitmap

objects. If a user were tricked into displaying text with a specially-

crafted font, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute

arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. The

default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the

vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-0020](/security/CVE-2011-0020))

It was discovered that Pango incorrectly handled certain memory

reallocation failures. If a user were tricked into displaying text in a way

that would cause a reallocation failure, an attacker could cause a denial

of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking

the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04 LTS and 10.10.

([CVE-2011-0064](/security/CVE-2011-0064))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
