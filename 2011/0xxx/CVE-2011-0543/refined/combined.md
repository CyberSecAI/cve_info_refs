1) Solved Security Vulnerabilities
To avoid flooding mailing lists with SUSE Security Announcements for minor
issues, SUSE Security releases weekly summary reports for the low profile
vulnerability fixes. The SUSE Security Summary Reports do not list or
download URLs like the SUSE Security Announcements that are released for
more severe vulnerabilities.
Fixed packages for the following incidents are already available on our FTP
server and via the YaST Online Update.
- hplip
Specially crafted SNMP replies could cause a buffer overflow in
hplip's sane backend (CVE-2010-4267).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3

font parser of t1lib (CVE-2010-2642).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- bind
Crafted IXFR transfers or DDNS updates could hang BIND
(CVE-2011-0414).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3
- tomcat5, tomcat6

(CVE-2011-0013).
Web applications could read or write files outside the intended
working directory (CVE-2010-3718).
Specially crafted requests could lead to a denial of service
(CVE-2011-0534).

- libtiff
specially crafted tiff images could cause buffer overflows in
libtiff (CVE-2011-0191, CVE-2011-0192).

- krb5
A double-free issue in kdc when PKINIT is enabled allowed remote
attackers to crash the daemon or potentially execute arbitrary code
(CVE-2011-0284).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- nbd
A buffer overflow in the mainloop function the nbd server could
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0530).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- clamav
Specially crafted VBA data in Microsoft Office documents could crash
clamav or potentially even cause execution of arbitrary code. clamav
was updated to version 0.97 to fix the issue (CVE-2011-1003).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- aaa\_base
shell meta characters in file names could cause interactive shells
to execute arbitrary commands when performing tab expansion
(CVE-2011-0468).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- flash-player
The Adobe Flash Player was updated to version 10.2.153.1 to fix a
buffer overflow. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0609).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- pango
Specially crafted font files could cause a heap corruption in
applications linked against pango (CVE-2011-0064, CVE-2011-0020).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- openssl
A malformed ClientHello message could crash servers using openssl for
communication (CVE-2011-0014).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- subversion
Remote attackers could crash an svn server by causing a NULL deref
(CVE-2011-0715).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.4
- postgresql
A buffer overflow in the intarray module potentially allowed
attackers to execute arbitrary code as the user running postgresql
(CVE-2010-4015).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- logwatch
Shell meta characters in log file names could lead to execution of
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-1018).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- libxml2
Specially crafted xml files could crash applications linked against
libxml2 (CVE-2010-4494).
Affected Products: SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- quagga
Remote attackers could crash bgpd via a malformed Extended Communities or AS\_PATHLIMIT
attributes (CVE-2010-1674, CVE-2010-1675).

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.

Sure!

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=bf5ffb5fd8558bd799791834def431c0cee5a11f>

Fuse tries to mount a directory without resolving symlinks, and then
tries to update mtab. If it couldn't update mtab, it would unmount the
directory while resolving symlinks this time, resulting in a different
directory being unmounted.

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=1e7607ff89c65b005f69e27aeb1649d624099873>

This prevents local users from changing the location of the current
directory from under fuse using a timing attack.

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=cbd3a2a84068aae6e3fe32939d88470d712dbf47>

Fuse uses the --no-canonicalize mount option to prevent a symlink attack
on the mount point written to mtab. For backwards compatibility reasons,
it would fallback to using mount in an insecure way. This fallback could
get triggered by a user when an entry already existed in mtab.

All three of these issues allowed local users to trick fuse into
unmounting arbitrary directories.

Marc.

Sorry for the dealy, some other things popped up :(

I'm going to assign 3 IDs. These look like they maybe could be combined,
but I'd rather not try to just to have a big split later on when we find
out various versions are affected in different ways.

Subject: CVE request: fuse

Hello,

A few more fixes have made their way to FUSE to prevent TOCTTOU symlink
attacks. An unprivileged user was able to unmount arbitrary mounts:

<http://fuse.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=fuse/fuse;a=commit;h=bf5ffb5fd8558bd799791834def431c0cee5a11f>

Could we please get one or more CVE numbers for them?

Thanks,

Marc.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
