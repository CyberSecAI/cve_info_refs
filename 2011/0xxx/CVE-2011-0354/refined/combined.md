# Announcement Regarding Non-Cisco Product Security Alerts

On 2019 September 15, Cisco stopped publishing non-Cisco product alerts  alerts with vulnerability information about third-party software (TPS). Cisco will continue to publish Security Advisories to address both Cisco proprietary and TPS vulnerabilities per the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy. Cisco uses Release Note Enclosures to disclose the majority of TPS vulnerabilities; exceptions to this method are outlined in the Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities section of the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#3psv). The following links provide additional information.

**Vulnerability Information for Non-Cisco Products**

 National Vulnerability Database: <https://nvd.nist.gov>

 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: <https://cve.mitre.org>

**Vulnerability Information for Cisco Products**

 Cisco Bug Search Tool: <https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch>

 Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC): <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/case>

**Cisco Security Policy and Advisories**

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Cisco Security Advisory: Default Credentials for Root Account on
Tandberg E, EX and C Series Endpoints

Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110202-tandberg

Revision 1.0

For Public Release 2011 February 2 1600 UTC (GMT)

+---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
=======

Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX Personal Video units that are
running software versions prior to TC4.0.0 ship with a root
administrator account that is enabled by default with no password. An
attacker could use this account in order to modify the application
configuration or operating system settings.

Resolving this default password issue does not require a software
upgrade and can be changed or disabled by a configuration command for
all affected customers. The workaround detailed in this document
demonstrates how to disable the root account or change the password.

Affected Products
=================

Vulnerable Products
+------------------

This vulnerability affects Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX
Personal Video units, including software that is running on the C20,
C40, C60, C90, E20, EX60, and EX90 codecs. The software version of
the Tandberg unit can be determined by logging into the web-based
user interface (UI) or using the "xStatus SystemUnit" command.

Users can determine the Tandberg software version by entering the IP
address of the codec in a web browser, authenticating (if the device
is configured for authentication), and then selecting the "system
info" menu option. The version number is displayed after the
"Software Version" label in the System Info box.

Alternatively the software version can be determined from the
device's application programmer interface using the "xStatus
SystemUnit" command. The software version running on the codec is
displayed after the "SystemUnit Software Version" label. The output
from "xStatus SystemUnit" will display a result similar to the
following:

    xStatus SystemUnit

Details
=======

Tandberg devices are part of the Cisco TelePresence Systems that
provide Cisco TelePresence endpoints for immersive environments,
conference rooms, individual desktops and home offices. The C Series
Endpoints are typically deployed as Multipurpose Room Systems and the
E/EX Personal Video units are desktop devices.

These devices contain a root user that is enabled for advanced
debugging that is unnecessary during normal operations. The root
account is not the same as the admin and user accounts. The root user
is enabled by default in software versions prior to TC 4.0.0. The
default configuration prior to TC 4.0.0 does not set a password for
the root user.

When a device is upgraded to TC 4.0.0, the root user is disabled.
System software for Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX Personal
Video units is available for download at:

http://www.tandberg.com/support/video-conferencing-software-download.jsp?t=2

For instructions on how to set a root password or disable the root
user on other software versions, see the workaround section of this
advisory.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2011-0354.

Impact
======

Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an
unauthorized user to modify the application configuration and the
operating system settings or gain complete administrative control of
the device.

Software Versions and Fixes
===========================

When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.

In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.

Workarounds
===========

The root user is disabled in the default configuration starting in
the TC4.0.0 software version. To disable the root account, an
administrator should log in to the applications programmer interface
and use the command "systemtools rootsettings off" to temporarily
disable the account, or the command "systemtools rootsettings never"
to permanently disable the root user.

The root user is enabled for advanced debugging. If the root user is
needed, the password should be configured when the account is
enabled. This can be done through the command "systemtools
rootsettings on [password]".

Devices running software version TC 4.0.0 or later

The root user is disabled in the default configuration starting in
the TC4.0.0 software version. To disable the root account, an
administrator should log in to the applications programmer interface
and use the command "systemtools rootsettings off" to temporarily
disable the account, or the command "systemtools rootsettings never"
to permanently disable the root user.

The root user is enabled for advanced debugging. If the root user is
needed, the password should be configured when the account is
enabled. This can be done through the command "systemtools
rootsettings on [password]".

The default configuration of devices running TC4.0.0 does not contain
a password for the administrator account. The password for the
administrator account should be set with the command "xCommand
SystemUnit AdminPassword Set Password: [password].

Devices running software versions prior to TC 4.0.0

The root user cannot be disabled on devices running software versions
prior to TC4.0.0. The password for the root account is the same as
the administrator password. The administrator password is set with
the command "xCommand SystemUnit AdminPassword Set Password:
[password]".

Obtaining Fixed Software
========================

Cisco has released free software updates that address these
vulnerabilities. Prior to deploying software, customers should
consult their maintenance provider or check the software for feature
set compatibility and known issues specific to their environment.

Customers may only install and expect support for the feature sets
they have purchased. By installing, downloading, accessing or
otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to be bound
by the terms of Cisco's software license terms found at
http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/EU1KEN_.html,
or as otherwise set forth at Cisco.com Downloads at
http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml

Do not contact psirt () cisco com or security-alert () cisco com for
software upgrades.

Customers with Service Contracts
+-------------------------------

Customers with contracts should obtain upgraded software through
their regular update channels. For most customers, this means that
upgrades should be obtained through the Software Center on Cisco's

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Cisco Tandberg E, EX, and C Series default root credentials

#### Vulnerability Note VU#436854

Original Release Date: 2011-02-03 | Last Revised: 2011-02-03

---

### Overview

Cisco's Tandberg C series endpoints and E/EX personal video units that run software versions prior to TC4.0.0 have a root administrator account enabled by default with no password.

### Description

| [Cisco Advisory cisco-sa-20110202-tandberg](http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110202-tandberg.shtml) states:  *"This vulnerability affects Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX Personal Video units, including software that is running on the C20, C40, C60, C90, E20, EX60, and EX90 codecs. The software version of the Tandberg unit can be determined by logging into the web-based user interface (UI) or using the "xStatus SystemUnit" command.**Users can determine the Tandberg software version by entering the IP address of the codec in a web browser, authenticating (if the device is configured for authentication), and then selecting the "system info" menu option. The version number is displayed after the "Software Version" label in the System Info box.**Alternatively the software version can be determined from the device's application programmer interface using the "xStatus SystemUnit" command. The software version running on the codec is displayed after the "SystemUnit Software Version" label. The output from "xStatus SystemUnit" will display a result similar to the following:"**xStatus SystemUnit**\*s SystemUnit ProductType: "Cisco TelePresence Codec"**\*s SystemUnit ProductId: "Cisco TelePresence Codec C90"**\*s SystemUnit ProductPlatform: "C90"**\*s SystemUnit Uptime: 597095**\*s SystemUnit Software Application: "Endpoint"**\*s SystemUnit Software Version: "TC4.0"**\*s SystemUnit Software Name: "s52000"**\*s SystemUnit Software ReleaseDate: "2010-11-01"**\*s SystemUnit Software MaxVideoCalls: 3**\*s SystemUnit Software MaxAudioCalls: 4**\*s SystemUnit Software ReleaseKey: "true"**\*s SystemUnit Software OptionKeys NaturalPresenter: "true"**\*s SystemUnit Software OptionKeys MultiSite: "true"**\*s SystemUnit Software OptionKeys PremiumResolution: "true"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware Module SerialNumber: "B1AD25A00003"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware Module Identifier: "0"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware MainBoard SerialNumber: "PH0497201"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware MainBoard Identifier: "101401-3 [04]"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware VideoBoard SerialNumber: "PH0497874"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware VideoBoard Identifier: "101560-1 [02]"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware AudioBoard SerialNumber: "N/A"**\*s SystemUnit Hardware AudioBoard Identifier:* *\*s SystemUnit Hardware BootSoftware: "U-Boot 2009.03-65"**\*s SystemUnit State System: Initialized**\*s SystemUnit State MaxNumberOfCalls: 3**\*s SystemUnit State MaxNumberOfActiveCalls: 3**\*s SystemUnit State NumberOfActiveCalls: 1**\*s SystemUnit State NumberOfSuspendedCalls: 0**\*s SystemUnit State NumberOfInProgressCalls: 0**\*s SystemUnit State Subsystem Application: Initialized**\*s SystemUnit ContactInfo: "helpdesk@company.com"**\*\* end* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker may be able to gain complete administrative control of the device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**  Users should upgrade to version TC4.0.0 or later of the device software, disable the root account, and verify the administrator account has a password set. Updates are available from the [Cisco Software Area](http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/sw-usingswc.shtml). |

| **Devices running software version TC 4.0.0 or later**To disable the root account, an administrator should log in to the applications programmer interface and use the command "systemtools rootsettings off" to temporarily disable the account, or the command "systemtools rootsettings never" to permanently disable the root user.The root user is enabled for advanced debugging. If the root user is needed, the password should be configured when the account is enabled. This can be done through the command "systemtools rootsettings on [password]".The default configuration of devices running TC4.0.0 does not contain a password for the administrator account. The password for the administrator account should be set with the command "xCommand SystemUnit AdminPassword Set Password: [password]".**Devices running software versions prior to TC 4.0.0**The root user cannot be disabled on devices running software versions prior to TC4.0.0. The password for the root account is the same as the administrator password. The administrator password is set with the command "xCommand SystemUnit AdminPassword Set Password: [password]". |

Cisco Security Advisory: Default Credentials for Root Account on
Tandberg E, EX and C Series Endpoints
Advisory ID: cisco-sa-20110202-tandberg
Revision 1.0
For Public Release 2011 February 2 1600 UTC (GMT)
+---------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
=======
Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX Personal Video units that are
running software versions prior to TC4.0.0 ship with a root
administrator account that is enabled by default with no password. An
attacker could use this account in order to modify the application
configuration or operating system settings.
Resolving this default password issue does not require a software
upgrade and can be changed or disabled by a configuration command for
all affected customers. The workaround detailed in this document
demonstrates how to disable the root account or change the password.
This advisory is posted at
http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/707/cisco-sa-20110202-tandberg.shtml.
Affected Products
=================
Vulnerable Products
+------------------
This vulnerability affects Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX
Personal Video units, including software that is running on the C20,
C40, C60, C90, E20, EX60, and EX90 codecs. The software version of
the Tandberg unit can be determined by logging into the web-based
user interface (UI) or using the "xStatus SystemUnit" command.
Users can determine the Tandberg software version by entering the IP
address of the codec in a web browser, authenticating (if the device
is configured for authentication), and then selecting the "system
info" menu option. The version number is displayed after the
"Software Version" label in the System Info box.
Alternatively the software version can be determined from the
device's application programmer interface using the "xStatus
SystemUnit" command. The software version running on the codec is
displayed after the "SystemUnit Software Version" label. The output
from "xStatus SystemUnit" will display a result similar to the
following:

Details
=======
Tandberg devices are part of the Cisco TelePresence Systems that
provide Cisco TelePresence endpoints for immersive environments,
conference rooms, individual desktops and home offices. The C Series
Endpoints are typically deployed as Multipurpose Room Systems and the
E/EX Personal Video units are desktop devices.
These devices contain a root user that is enabled for advanced
debugging that is unnecessary during normal operations. The root
account is not the same as the admin and user accounts. The root user
is enabled by default in software versions prior to TC 4.0.0. The
default configuration prior to TC 4.0.0 does not set a password for
the root user.
When a device is upgraded to TC 4.0.0, the root user is disabled.
System software for Tandberg C Series Endpoints and E/EX Personal
Video units is available for download at:
http://www.tandberg.com/support/video-conferencing-software-download.jsp?t=2
For instructions on how to set a root password or disable the root
user on other software versions, see the workaround section of this
advisory.
This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE ID CVE-2011-0354.
Vulnerability Scoring Details
=============================
Cisco has provided scores for the vulnerabilities in this advisory
based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). The CVSS
scoring in this Security Advisory is done in accordance with CVSS
version 2.0.
CVSS is a standards-based scoring method that conveys vulnerability
severity and helps determine urgency and priority of response.
Cisco has provided a base and temporal score. Customers can then
compute environmental scores to assist in determining the impact of
the vulnerability in individual networks.
Cisco has provided an FAQ to answer additional questions regarding
CVSS at:
http://www.cisco.com/web/about/security/intelligence/cvss-qandas.html
Cisco has also provided a CVSS calculator to help compute the
environmental impact for individual networks at:
http://intellishield.cisco.com/security/alertmanager/cvss
\* Root account enabled by default with no password
CVSS Base Score - 10
Access Vector - Network

Impact
======
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability may allow an
unauthorized user to modify the application configuration and the
operating system settings or gain complete administrative control of
the device.
Software Versions and Fixes
===========================
When considering software upgrades, also consult
http://www.cisco.com/go/psirt
and any subsequent advisories to determine exposure and a
complete upgrade solution.
In all cases, customers should exercise caution to be certain the
devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and that current
hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported
properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, contact
the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or your contracted
maintenance provider for assistance.
Workarounds
===========
The root user is disabled in the default configuration starting in
the TC4.0.0 software version. To disable the root account, an
administrator should log in to the applications programmer interface
and use the command "systemtools rootsettings off" to temporarily
disable the account, or the command "systemtools rootsettings never"
to permanently disable the root user.
The root user is enabled for advanced debugging. If the root user is
needed, the password should be configured when the account is
enabled. This can be done through the command "systemtools
rootsettings on [password]".
Devices running software version TC 4.0.0 or later
The root user is disabled in the default configuration starting in
the TC4.0.0 software version. To disable the root account, an
administrator should log in to the applications programmer interface
and use the command "systemtools rootsettings off" to temporarily
disable the account, or the command "systemtools rootsettings never"
to permanently disable the root user.
The root user is enabled for advanced debugging. If the root user is
needed, the password should be configured when the account is
enabled. This can be done through the command "systemtools
rootsettings on [password]".
The default configuration of devices running TC4.0.0 does not contain
a password for the administrator account. The password for the
administrator account should be set with the command "xCommand
SystemUnit AdminPassword Set Password: [password].
Devices running software versions prior to TC 4.0.0
The root user cannot be disabled on devices running software versions
prior to TC4.0.0. The password for the root account is the same as
the administrator password. The administrator password is set with
the command "xCommand SystemUnit AdminPassword Set Password:
[password]".
