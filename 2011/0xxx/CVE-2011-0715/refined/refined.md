Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0715:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference in the `mod_dav_svn` module, a component of the Apache HTTP Server used to provide HTTP access to Subversion repositories.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The `mod_dav_svn` module fails to properly validate a pointer returned by `svn_fs_get_access()` before dereferencing it. This occurs specifically when processing requests to lock working copy paths in a repository and when the requesting Subversion client has not been authenticated to the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can trigger a denial of service (DoS) by sending a specially crafted lock request.
*   The crafted request causes the affected `httpd` process to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   Repeated attacks can lead to a sustained denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing the Subversion repository.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote, via an HTTP request.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker over HTTP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to an Apache server with the vulnerable `mod_dav_svn` module.
*   No authentication is required for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
*   The issue is specific to HTTP-based Subversion servers using the `mod_dav_svn` module.
*   Subversion servers that require authentication for read-only operations are not vulnerable to this specific flaw.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Hyrum Wright of the Apache Subversion project, with acknowledgement to Philip Martin of WANdisco, Inc. as the original reporter.
*   A patch was created for Subversion 1.6.x which was backported for older versions to fix this issue.
