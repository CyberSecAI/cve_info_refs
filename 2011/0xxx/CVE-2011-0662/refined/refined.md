Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0662:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue within the `win32k.sys` driver. It stems from improper management of kernel-mode driver objects. Specifically, the driver fails to properly handle object lifetimes leading to the possibility of accessing memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core issue is that the vulnerable driver accesses a memory location after it has been deallocated. This can cause corruption and lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Improper Kernel-Mode Driver Object Management:** The vulnerability is a result of not managing the object lifetimes correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
- **Complete System Control:** Gaining kernel-mode access grants the attacker full control of the system. They can install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on to the system locally.
- **Specially Crafted Application:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the target system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log on to the target system locally.
- **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute a malicious program on the system.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was privately reported.
- The vulnerability is addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
- The update fixes the vulnerability by correcting how kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects.
- This vulnerability is one of several addressed in the same update (MS11-034)

**Summary**

CVE-2011-0662 is a use-after-free vulnerability that exists because of the way Windows Kernel-mode drivers manage kernel-mode driver objects. An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can gain complete control of a vulnerable system. The attacker must log on locally and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability is addressed by a Microsoft security update that corrects the kernel-mode driver object management.
