Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-0264

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `ovutil.dll` component of Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager. When handling the `COOKIE` variable passed via a GET request, the process copies user-supplied data into a fixed-length buffer on the stack without proper bounds checking.
*   **Weaknesses:** This is a classic stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The primary weakness is the lack of input validation or bounds checking when copying the user-supplied data into the fixed-size buffer.
*  **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted GET request with an overly long `COOKIE` variable.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and can send arbitrary web requests over the network. The webserver is listening by default on TCP port 80
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite critical parts of the stack, including return addresses, and ultimately execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SYSTEM service.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Hewlett-Packard OpenView Network Node Manager.
*   **CVSS Score:** 10.0 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C), indicating critical severity.
