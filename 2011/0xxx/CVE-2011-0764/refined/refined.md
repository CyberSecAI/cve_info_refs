{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The t1lib library incorrectly parses Type 1 fonts, leading to an invalid pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Invalid pointer dereference during Type 1 font parsing"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (crash) and may be able to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By coercing users to process a specially crafted Type 1 font file, which can be embedded in PDF documents or other file formats handled by affected software."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create or modify font files and trick the user into processing the crafted font file using vulnerable software.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability exists due to t1lib embedding a copy of Xpdf, and t1lib processing Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) files or PostScript Type 1 fonts embedded in PDF documents. This vulnerability can be triggered by opening a specially-crafted font or PDF file. The fix is to build Xpdf without t1lib using FreeType."
