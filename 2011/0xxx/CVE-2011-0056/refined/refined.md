Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-0056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the JavaScript engine (SpiderMonkey) of Mozilla Firefox, specifically in how it handles string literals (atoms). When compiling JavaScript, the engine stores these literals in an atom map. Opcodes that use these atoms as values use a 16-bit immediate constant as an index into the atom map array. When the number of atoms exceeds 64K, the engine uses "indexbaseX" and "resetbase0" opcodes to move the atoms pointer forward and backward, respectively. If an exception is thrown between these two opcodes, the atoms pointer does not get reset, leading to the exception object being read from an invalid memory address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of the atom pointer when exceptions are thrown during bytecode execution.
- Lack of proper reset of the atoms pointer after an exception within the context of index base opcodes.
- Memory corruption due to accessing invalid memory locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
- Potential for a malicious website to compromise the user's system.
- Crash or unexpected behavior in vulnerable Firefox or SeaMonkey browsers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious web pages containing specially crafted JavaScript code with more than 64k string literals or atoms.
-  Heap spraying techniques are employed to populate memory with the needed structures for reliable code execution.
- Social engineering to lure users to the malicious page.
- Injection of malicious content into compromised trusted sites.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create or control a website that can serve malicious JavaScript.
- Ability to craft JavaScript code to trigger the vulnerability by creating a large number of atoms and triggering an exception at a specific point in the code execution.

**Additional Details:**
-  The bug report mentions that exploiting the vulnerability requires control of various structures at the location of the invalid reference, which can be achieved through heap spraying.
- The vulnerability is considered "critical" due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
- Patches for various versions of Firefox and SeaMonkey were created, addressing the missing re-initialization of atoms.
- The provided PoC was a shell PoC that needed additional manipulation to work on a browser level.
