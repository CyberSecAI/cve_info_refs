How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694933#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-08 23:24:37 UTC  ``` It was reported [1] that threads in Mono were not properly cleaned up upon finalization, so if one thread was resurrected, it would be possible to see the pointer to freed memory.  This could lead to unintended information disclosure, and possibly a crash.  This has been corrected upstream [2].  [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678515> [2] <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/722f9890f09aadfc37ae479e7d946d5fc5ef7b91>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=694933#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-08 23:25:56 UTC  ``` Created mono tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 694934](show_bug.cgi?id=694934 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2011-0992 mono: information leak due to improper thread finalization [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=694933#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-04-13 22:16:43 UTC  ``` There are additional flaws that were fixed in mono, but judging by their descriptions, they are only problems when moonlight is used (which we do not ship).  For reference, and because we may want to patch them as well (since the fix was done in mono):  CVE-2011-0989: <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667077> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/035c8587c0d8d307e45f1b7171a0d337bb451f1e>  The RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray method in metadata/icall.c in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, does not properly restrict data types, which allows remote attackers to modify internal read-only data structures, and cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security manager, via a crafted media file, as demonstrated by modifying a C# struct.  CVE-2011-0990: <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667077> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/2f00e4bbb2137130845afb1b2a1e678552fc8e5c>  Race condition in the FastCopy optimization in the Array.Copy method in metadata/icall.c in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer overflow and modify internal data structures, and cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security manager, via a crafted media file in which a thread makes a change after a type check but before a copy action.  CVE-2011-0991: <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=660422> <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667077> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/3f8ee42b8c867d9a4c18c22657840d072cca5c3a> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/89d1455a80ef13cddee5d79ec00c06055da3085c> <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/8eb1189099e02372fd45ca1c67230eccf1edddc0>  Use-after-free vulnerability in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to finalizing and then resurrecting a DynamicMethod instance.  CVE-2011:0992: <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667077> <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678515> [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694933](show_bug.cgi?id=694933 "CLOSED UPSTREAM - CVE-2011-0989 CVE-2011-0990 CVE-2011-0991 CVE-2011-0992 mono: multiple vulnerabilities fixed in 2.4.1/3.99.3") <https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/722f9890f09aadfc37ae479e7d946d5fc5ef7b91>  Use-after-free vulnerability in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or obtain sensitive information via vectors related to member data in a resurrected MonoThread instance.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=694933#c3)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-06-10 10:57:46 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product. Refer to the dependent bugs for status of those individual community products.   ``` |  |

Message-ID: <20110406180648.GA3660@suse.de>
Date: Wed, 6 Apr 2011 20:06:51 +0200
From: Marcus Meissner <meissner@...e.de>
To: OSS Security List <oss-security@...ts.openwall.com>
Subject: Moonlight release 2.4.1 with security fixes

Hi,

The Novell Mono developers are just releasing Moonlight (the Mono
Silverlight equivalent) security updates for several critical issues.

The first 3 issues were reported to the Mono team by Jeroen Frijters
(<http://www.ikvm.net/>).

The fixed versions is 2.4.1 for the 2.4 branch and 3.99.3 for the 3.99
(Moonlight 4 preview) branch.

The main Novell tracker bug for this update:
<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667077>

CVE-2011-0989: modification of read-only values via
RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/035c8587c0d8d307e45f1b7171a0d337bb451f1e>

The modification of read-only variables (e.g. from outside the sandbox)
could be used for breaking out of the moonlight sandboxing.

CVE-2011-0990: buffer overflow due to race condition in in Array.FastCopy
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/2f00e4bbb2137130845afb1b2a1e678552fc8e5c>

Similar to the above, an array element could be changed to a privileged
read-only element which would then be overwritten.
(So not a lowlevel buffer overflow, but a sandboxing violation/break out.)

CVE-2011-0991: use-after-free due to DynamicMethod resurrection
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/8eb1189099e02372fd45ca1c67230eccf1edddc0>
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/89d1455a80ef13cddee5d79ec00c06055da3085c>

Also fixed in this update:
CVE-2011-0992: information leak due to improper thread finalization
<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678515>
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/722f9890f09aadfc37ae479e7d946d5fc5ef7b91>

Ciao, Marcus

```
	* reflection.c: Use a reference queue to cleanup
	dynamic methods instead of finalization.

	* runtime.c: Shutdown the dynamic method queue
	before runtime cleanup begins.

	* DynamicMethod.cs: No longer finalizable.

	* icall-def.h: Remove unused dynamic method icall.

	Fixes #660422

Implement a reference queue API.

```
	* gc.c: A reference queue allows one to queue
	callbcks for when objects are collected.
	It allows for safe cleanup of objects that can
	only be done when it is effectively collected.
	The major difference with regular finalization
	is that the collector makes sure the object
	was collected - and can't be resurrected.

	* gc-internal.h: Export entrypoints for the
	new API.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
