{
  "CVE-2011-0989": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability lies in the `RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray` function of Moonlight, which allows modification of read-only values.",
    "Root cause": "The `RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray` function does not properly restrict the types of arrays it can initialize, allowing for the initialization of arrays containing references or value types with references.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper restriction of operations within the sandbox environment.",
      "Modification of read-only data."
    ],
    "Impact": "The modification of read-only variables could be exploited to break out of the Moonlight sandbox environment, potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": "By utilizing a crafted Moonlight application, an attacker could call the vulnerable `RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray` with an array containing references or value types with references, resulting in the modification of read-only values.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to execute a crafted Moonlight application on a system with a vulnerable version of Moonlight. This could be achieved by tricking a user into visiting a malicious web page containing a malicious Moonlight application or by some other method of deploying the malicious app on the target system."
