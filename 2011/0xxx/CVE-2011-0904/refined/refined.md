Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-0904:

**Root Cause:**

*   An out-of-bounds read flaw exists in the `rfbTranslateNone` function within the `vino` VNC server. This occurs when processing specific client framebuffer update requests using raw encoding. The vulnerability is triggered by an incorrect calculation of the memory region to read from, leading to an out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core issue is that `vino` attempts to read memory outside the allocated buffer when handling a crafted VNC client request, specifically during the processing of raw-encoded framebuffer updates.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability arises because the server doesn't properly validate the coordinates provided in the client's framebuffer update request before performing the memory read operation, which leads to the out of bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to cause the `vino` server to crash, effectively denying service to legitimate users by sending a specially crafted frame buffer update request.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** A remote attacker can send a specially crafted VNC client request over the network to the vulnerable `vino` server to trigger the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to send a VNC request to the target `vino` server.
*   **VNC Client:** The attacker needs to craft or use a VNC client capable of sending malformed framebuffer update requests with raw encoding.
*   **Authenticated VNC Client (in some cases):** It is stated that in some circumstances, an authenticated client may also be needed, but it is not required in all cases.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The `rfbTranslateNone` function is responsible for translating pixel formats during framebuffer updates.
*   The vulnerability is related to the `memcpy` operation within the `rfbTranslateNone` function.
*   The vulnerable code is present in `rfbserver.c` within the `vino` codebase.
*   The issue was initially misreported as an out-of-bounds write but was later corrected as an out-of-bounds read.
*   Patches involve validating the rectangle given by the update packet to ensure that `w + x` and `h + y` are not greater than the scaled screen dimensions.
*   The vulnerability is present in `vino` versions prior to the fix. `libvncserver` is not vulnerable to this specific flaw due to proper checks, even though `vino` uses `libvncserver`.

**Affected Products (from Red Hat Advisory):**

*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6
*   Fedora release 13 and 14 (not affected are the libvncserver versions shipped with RHEL 6, EPEL-5, or Fedora 13 and 14)
*   kdenetwork package shipped with RHEL 4 and 5

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to patched versions of `vino` which perform appropriate bounds checking to prevent out-of-bounds reads.
*   Red Hat provided updates for RHEL 6 via RHSA-2013:0169.
*   Ubuntu released updates as USN-1128-1.
