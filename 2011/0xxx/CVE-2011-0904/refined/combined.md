| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-07 12:48:12 UTC  ``` An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way vino, remote desktop system for GNOME processed certain framebuffer update requests from VNC client, when raw encoding was used. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to vino, causing it to crash.  Upstream bug report: [1] <https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641802>  Relevant upstream commits (for gnome-2-28, gnome-2-30, gnome-2-32, gnome-3-0 and master branches):  [2] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=dff52694a384fe95195f2211254026b752d63ec4> [3] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=0c2c9175963fc56bf2af10e42867181332f96ce0> [4] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=e17bd4e369f90748654e31a4867211dc7610975d> [5] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=456dadbb5c5971d3448763a44c05b9ad033e522f> [6] <http://git.gnome.org/browse/vino/commit/?id=8beefcf7792d343c10c919ee0c928c81f73b1279>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-07 13:14:49 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the vino package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.  This issue affects the versions of the vino package, as shipped with Fedora release of 13 and 14.  --  This issue did NOT affect the version of the libvncserver package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

It checks whether subtraction result fits into uint16_t. Otherwise it refuse the conversion and warning is printed and client request is refused. This is the output I get on server side with the Clipping log line:  Clipping: region(29696Xx32768Y-1Wx30975H) to screen(400Wx300H) Warning, ignoring rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest: 29696Xx32768Y-36240Wx30975H  The Cliping values correspond to the run_00108.input3 packet content: $ hexdump -C run_00108.input3 00000000  03 00 74 00 80 00 00 01  78 ff                    |..t.....x.|  03 00 is the request type probably 74 00 (29696) is X coordinate 80 00 (32768) is Y cooridnate 00 01 (1) is Width 78 ff (30975) is Height   Let's look on the clipping code closer and remember the *x and *w are uint16_t: if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         *w=cl->screen->width-*x; /* possible underflow */ if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         return FALSE;  If X fits into screen width, then substraction result is not negative and request width is clamped properly.  If X is out of screen width, then subtraction underruns and *W will be garbled (as can be seen in my output, 1W → 36240W), but still non-negative (because unsigned type). However subsequent underrun test will compare garbled non-negative value to negative subtraction result (the same as former one) resulting is true condition and causing `return FALSE'.  The same applies to vertical clipping.  Thus I conclude LIBVNCSERVER IS NOT VULNERABLE because it performs the range check on this place. One can see it's the same equation as in current patch:  +   /* Validate the rectangle given by the update packet. */ +   if (w + x > cl->scaledScreen->width || h + y > cl->scaledScreen->height) +       goto updateFailed;   -- Petr   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c21)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:12:27 UTC  ``` Created vino tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 701712](show_bug.cgi?id=701712 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0904 CVE-2011-0905 vino various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c22)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:22:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c0)  Kevin    2011-02-08 04:32:39 UTC  ``` Summary ======= Program: vino-server (vino 2.32.1) Type: Out-of-bounds write to arbitrary memory location Impact: Critical  Authors ======= The Bitblaze group at UC Berkeley. <http://bitblaze.cs.berkeley.edu/>   Description =========== The rfbTranslateNone function in rfbserver.c in vino-server in Vino 2.26.1 and 2.32.1 (the latest release) allows remote attackers to trigger an out-of-bounds write, via a very large "X position" value or a vary large "Y position" value in a "client framebuffer update request" packet.  Platforms affected ================== The bug has been tested on a Ubuntu 9.04 platform using both Vino 2.26.1 and Vino 2.32.1, the latter one is the latest version of the program. Other versions between these two releases could similarly be affected.  Vulnerable function =================== In process: vino-server Function backtrace stack (in vino 2.32.1):   ```  + [Trace 225886](page.cgi?id=traceparser/trace.html&trace_id=225886)   | * #0   ?? * #1   rfbTranslateNone   at /usr/include/bits/string3.h   line   52 * #2   rfbSendRectEncodingRaw   at rfbserver.c   line   1328 * #3   rfbSendFramebufferUpdate   at rfbserver.c   line   1168 * #4   rfbUpdateClient   at main.c   line   512 * #5   vino\_server\_update\_client   at vino-server.c   line   409 * #6   vino\_server\_client\_data\_pending   at vino-server.c   line   451 * #7   ?? * #8   ?? * #9   ?? * #10   ?? * #11   ?? * #12   ?? | | --- |  ```    Impact ======  Critical (Arbitrary write)  Reproducible ============  Yes, the bug is reproducible. And the pcap file is as attached.   Vulnerability description =========================  The vulnerability is a out-of-bounds write. It is triggered by the memcpy function in rfbTranslateNone, when handling the "client framebuffer update request" packet from a vnc client:  void rfbTranslateNone(char *table, rfbPixelFormat *in, rfbPixelFormat *out,                  char *iptr, char *optr, int bytesBetweenInputLines,                  int width, int height) {     int bytesPerOutputLine = width * (out->bitsPerPixel / 8);      while (height > 0) {         memcpy(optr, iptr, bytesPerOutputLine); //out-of-bounds write         iptr += bytesBetweenInputLines;         optr += bytesPerOutputLine;         height--;     } }  Here 'optr' points out of the boundary, and 'optr' is from the caller: rfbSendRectEncodingRaw (rfbserver.c:1328)          (*cl->translateFn)(cl->translateLookupTable,                &(cl->screen->rfbServerFormat),                            &cl->format, fbptr, &cl->updateBuf[cl->ublen],                            cl->screen->paddedWidthInBytes, w, nlines);  // (*cl->translateFn) is rfbTranslateNone, and the value of fbptr is passed to optr.   In rfbSendRectEncodingRaw, fbptr is calculated from some fields in the packet:      char *fbptr = (cl->screen->frameBuffer + (cl->screen->paddedWidthInBytes * y)                    + (x * (cl->screen->bitsPerPixel / 8)));  where x is 29696 and y is 32768 in our PoC packet.  Also the core dump file and original binary are attached with this email. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c1)  David King    2011-03-05 10:37:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 182540](attachment.cgi?id=182540 "Validate framebuffer update packet size") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=182540&action=edit "Validate framebuffer update packet size") [[review]](review?bug=641802&attachment=182540) Validate framebuffer update packet size  Hi Kevin, I am the new maintainer of Vino, and I would very much like to get this bug fixed quickly. I am not that familiar with the libvncserver code, but I have attached a patch to this bug which I think should fix the problem. Can you verify that it is a correct fix?  I also realised that this part of the Vino code is from libvncserver (<http://libvncserver.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=libvncserver/libvncserver;a=blob;f=libvncserver/rfbserver.c;h=73be34cb8a8cc70a19ff10d85b928d8e1cfed87d;hb=HEAD#l2968>) and that code also seems to have the same problem, which could affect other projects. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c2)  Kevin    2011-03-08 09:09:39 UTC  ``` Hi David,  Yes I tried this patch on Vino 2.32.1 and it fixes this bug. However, [Bug 641803](show_bug.cgi?id=641803 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE") ([https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=641803](show_bug.cgi?id=641803 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE")) remains unpatched, which I believe can be patched together with this bug by somehow. I think patching somewhere else can fix both of these two bugs from the root cause. Thanks!  Thanks, Kevin ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c3)  David King    2011-03-08 09:29:40 UTC  ``` Thanks for your testing Kevin. I will have a fix for [bug 641803](show_bug.cgi?id=641803 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE") by tonight, hopefully. I checked the krfb (KDE equivalent of Vino) source code and discovered that it also does not validate the framebuffer update packet, in the same way as the libvncserver code linked from [comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c1) and as the code in Vino. I think that we should let those projects know and try to coordinate a security announcement. Do you have any experience with this process? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c4)  Kevin    2011-03-08 09:59:35 UTC  ``` Unfortunately I'm a newbie in this vulnerability reporting process. But I did reserved a CVE number for this vulnerability(CVE-2011-0904). Similarly, I also reserved a CVE number for [Bug 641803](show_bug.cgi?id=641803 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE"), which I'll comment in that thread for consistency.   I'm not sure whether krfb have similar security issues because it's possible that they have a boundary check before reaching the library. But I think it might help by letting them know this issue.   Thanks, Kevin ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c5)  AndrÃ© Klapper    2011-03-08 10:10:22 UTC  ``` Distro contacts for security issues: security@gnome.org , security@kde.org .

As mentioned in [bug 641803, comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=641803#c5 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE"), this is just pending on an email to (and response from) security@gnome.org ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=641802#c7)  Josh Bressers    2011-04-14 18:39:50 UTC  ``` Would it be possible to share the reproducer for this and [bug 641803](show_bug.cgi?id=641803 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE")? Red Hat has to backport this fix to a number of versions of vino, so being able to verify we've actually fixed it would be helpful.

## Synopsis

Moderate: vino security update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2013%3A0169)

## Topic

An updated vino package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Vino is a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server for GNOME. It allows
remote users to connect to a running GNOME session using VNC.

It was found that Vino transmitted all clipboard activity on the system
running Vino to all clients connected to port 5900, even those who had not
authenticated. A remote attacker who is able to access port 5900 on a
system running Vino could use this flaw to read clipboard data without
authenticating. (CVE-2012-4429)

Two out-of-bounds memory read flaws were found in the way Vino processed
client framebuffer requests in certain encodings. An authenticated client
could use these flaws to send a specially-crafted request to Vino, causing
it to crash. (CVE-2011-0904, CVE-2011-0905)

In certain circumstances, the vino-preferences dialog box incorrectly
indicated that Vino was only accessible from the local network. This could
confuse a user into believing connections from external networks are not
allowed (even when they are allowed). With this update, vino-preferences no
longer displays connectivity and reachable information. (CVE-2011-1164)

There was no warning that Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) was used to open
ports on a user's network router when the "Configure network automatically
to accept connections" option was enabled (it is disabled by default) in
the Vino preferences. This update changes the option's description to avoid
the risk of a UPnP router configuration change without the user's consent.
(CVE-2011-1165)

All Vino users should upgrade to this updated package, which contains
backported patches to resolve these issues. The GNOME session must be
restarted (log out, then log back in) for this update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/11258>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694456#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-07 12:50:46 UTC  ``` An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way vino, remote desktop system for GNOME processed certain framebuffer update requests from VNC client, when tight encoding was used.

It checks whether subtraction result fits into uint16_t. Otherwise it refuse the conversion and warning is printed and client request is refused. This is the output I get on server side with the Clipping log line:  Clipping: region(29696Xx32768Y-1Wx30975H) to screen(400Wx300H) Warning, ignoring rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest: 29696Xx32768Y-36240Wx30975H  The Cliping values correspond to the run_00108.input3 packet content: $ hexdump -C run_00108.input3 00000000  03 00 74 00 80 00 00 01  78 ff                    |..t.....x.|  03 00 is the request type probably 74 00 (29696) is X coordinate 80 00 (32768) is Y cooridnate 00 01 (1) is Width 78 ff (30975) is Height  Let's look on the clipping code closer and remember the *x and *w are uint16_t: if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         *w=cl->screen->width-*x; /* possible underflow */ if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         return FALSE;  If X fits into screen width, then substraction result is not negative and request width is clamped properly.  If X is out of screen width, then subtraction underruns and *W will be garbled (as can be seen in my output, 1W → 36240W), but still non-negative (because unsigned type). However subsequent underrun test will compare garbled non-negative value to negative subtraction result (the same as former one) resulting is true condition and causing `return FALSE'.  The same applies to vertical clipping.  Thus I conclude LIBVNCSERVER IS NOT VULNERABLE because it performs the range check on this place. One can see it's the same equation as in current patch:  +   /* Validate the rectangle given by the update packet. */ +   if (w + x > cl->scaledScreen->width || h + y > cl->scaledScreen->height) +       goto updateFailed;   -- Petr   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=694456#c18)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:12:46 UTC  ``` Created vino tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 701712](show_bug.cgi?id=701712 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0904 CVE-2011-0905 vino various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=694456#c19)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:21:37 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=694456#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
=====================================================================
SUSE's security contact is <security@suse.com> or <security@suse.de>.
The <security@suse.de> public key is listed below.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-04-07 12:48:12 UTC  ``` An out of bounds read flaw was found in the way vino, remote desktop system for GNOME processed certain framebuffer update requests from VNC client, when raw encoding was used. An attacker could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted request to vino, causing it to crash.

So this bug is about reading out of buffer, not about writing.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c20)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 13:35:17 UTC  ``` Analysis from Petr Pisar (Red Hat libvncserver package maintainer) why various libvncserver package versions, as shipped within different products are not vulnerable to this flaw:   The libvncserver warning is produced in rfbserver.c:rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() when converting rectangle coordinates just after processing client packet of rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest type:      case rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest:         [...]         if ((n = rfbReadExact(cl, ((char *)&msg) + 1,                            sz_rfbFramebufferUpdateRequestMsg-1)) <= 0) {             [...]         }         [...]         /* The values come in based on the scaled screen, we need to convert          * them to values based on the main screen's coordinate system          */         if(!rectSwapIfLEAndClip(&msg.fur.x,&msg.fur.y,&msg.fur.w,&msg.fur.h,cl))         {                 rfbLog("Warning, ignoring rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest: "                     "%dXx%dY-%dWx%dH\n",                     msg.fur.x, msg.fur.y, msg.fur.w, msg.fur.h);                 return;         }         [...]  Not only the rectSwapIfLEAndClip() function converts values from network-order and scales the coordinates, it also clips requested rectangle (msg.fur members) to fit into server screen size:  rfbBool rectSwapIfLEAndClip(uint16_t* x,uint16_t* y,uint16_t* w,uint16_t* h,                 rfbClientPtr cl) {         /* Convert */         int x1=Swap16IfLE(*x);         int y1=Swap16IfLE(*y);         int w1=Swap16IfLE(*w);         int h1=Swap16IfLE(*h);          /* Scale */         rfbScaledCorrection(cl->scaledScreen, cl->screen, &x1, &y1, &w1, &h1,             "rectSwapIfLEAndClip");         *x = x1;         *y = y1;         *w = w1;         *h = h1;          /* Clip         rfbLog("Clipping: region(%uXx%uY-%uWx%uH) to screen(%dWx%dH)\n",                 *x, *y, *w, *h,                 cl->screen->width, cl->screen->height);         */         if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)                 *w=cl->screen->width-*x;         /* possible underflow */         if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)                 return FALSE;         if(*h>cl->screen->height-*y)                 *h=cl->screen->height-*y;         if(*h>cl->screen->height-*y)                 return FALSE;          return TRUE; }  And see the comment /* possible underflow */ (other comments added by me). It checks whether subtraction result fits into uint16_t. Otherwise it refuse the conversion and warning is printed and client request is refused. This is the output I get on server side with the Clipping log line:  Clipping: region(29696Xx32768Y-1Wx30975H) to screen(400Wx300H) Warning, ignoring rfbFramebufferUpdateRequest: 29696Xx32768Y-36240Wx30975H  The Cliping values correspond to the run_00108.input3 packet content: $ hexdump -C run_00108.input3 00000000  03 00 74 00 80 00 00 01  78 ff                    |..t.....x.|  03 00 is the request type probably 74 00 (29696) is X coordinate 80 00 (32768) is Y cooridnate 00 01 (1) is Width 78 ff (30975) is Height   Let's look on the clipping code closer and remember the *x and *w are uint16_t: if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         *w=cl->screen->width-*x; /* possible underflow */ if(*w>cl->screen->width-*x)         return FALSE;  If X fits into screen width, then substraction result is not negative and request width is clamped properly.  If X is out of screen width, then subtraction underruns and *W will be garbled (as can be seen in my output, 1W → 36240W), but still non-negative (because unsigned type). However subsequent underrun test will compare garbled non-negative value to negative subtraction result (the same as former one) resulting is true condition and causing `return FALSE'.  The same applies to vertical clipping.  Thus I conclude LIBVNCSERVER IS NOT VULNERABLE because it performs the range check on this place. One can see it's the same equation as in current patch:  +   /* Validate the rectangle given by the update packet. */ +   if (w + x > cl->scaledScreen->width || h + y > cl->scaledScreen->height) +       goto updateFailed;   -- Petr   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c21)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:12:27 UTC  ``` Created vino tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 701712](show_bug.cgi?id=701712 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0904 CVE-2011-0905 vino various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c22)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-05-03 16:22:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=694455#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2013-01-21 22:37:20 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2013:0169 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0169.html>   ``` |  |

      Vino strings are always in english regardless system language.
      This is caused by wrong locale dir. $(DATADIRNAME) which is used to
      build the path seems undefined. Let's use $(localedir) instead
      to fix this issue.
