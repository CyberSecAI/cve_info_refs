{
  "cve": "CVE-2011-0905",
  "extracted_information": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read flaw exists in the `vino` application, specifically when processing framebuffer update requests using tight encoding from a VNC client.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can send a specially crafted request that causes `vino` to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A remote attacker can send a crafted framebuffer update request to the `vino` VNC server."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted framebuffer update request to the `vino` server. Authentication is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement, however, the vulnerability exists within the handling of client requests."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "affected_versions": "Vino versions shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5 and 6, and Fedora 13 and 14 are affected. libvncserver is not affected as it performs necessary checks. This issue also affected kdenetwork packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.",
    "fix_information": "The fix involves validating the rectangle specified in the update packet to prevent out-of-bounds memory access. The fix was ported to libvnserver-0.9.7. RHSA-2013:0169 addresses this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability lies in how `vino` handles tight encoding framebuffer update requests. While `libvncserver` includes checks that mitigate this issue, `vino` does not implement the necessary checks. The clipping mechanism in `libvncserver` also helps prevent this issue"
