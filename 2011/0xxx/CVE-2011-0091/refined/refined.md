{
  "CVE-2011-0091": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the possibility to downgrade Kerberos authentication to use DES instead of the stronger encryption standards included in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper enforcement of stronger default encryption standards, allowing a downgrade to weaker encryption (DES)."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could read and forge all of the Kerberos traffic in that session, potentially impersonating the user who was authenticating.",
    "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker intercepts communication between a client and server and forces a downgrade to DES encryption.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned between the target client and server to intercept communication and downgrade the encryption."
  }
}
