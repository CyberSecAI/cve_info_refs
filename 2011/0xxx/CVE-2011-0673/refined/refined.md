Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-0673:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference within the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys). Specifically, it stems from how kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core issue is that the driver attempts to access memory through a pointer that is unexpectedly null, leading to a crash or potentially exploitable condition.
*   Improper management of pointers to kernel-mode driver objects by the driver.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Complete System Control:**  The attacker gains full control over the affected system, with the ability to:
    *   Install programs.
    *   View, change, or delete data.
    *   Create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:**  The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application designed to trigger the null pointer dereference.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Local Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the targeted system.
*   **Ability to Log On Locally:** The attacker must be able to log on to the system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker needs to be able to execute a custom application on the system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is part of a larger group of vulnerabilities addressed in Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
*   This vulnerability, along with others in MS11-034, is classified as "Important."
*   The vulnerability is in `win32k.sys`.
*   The vulnerability was not publicly disclosed before the security bulletin was released.
*   There were no reports of active exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the bulletin's release.
* The fix corrects how kernel mode drivers keep track of pointers to kernel mode driver objects.
