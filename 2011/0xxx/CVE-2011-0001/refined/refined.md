Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a double-free error in the `scsi-target-utils` package (specifically within the `tgt` daemon). This occurs when a memory location is freed twice, leading to memory corruption.
- A related issue is a buffer overflow in the handling of incoming data before the iSCSI login phase in `iscsid.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Double-free vulnerability: The `tgt` daemon attempts to free the same memory location twice.
- Buffer Overflow: The iSCSI daemon doesn't properly validate the size of received data before login, leading to potential buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The double-free vulnerability can cause the `tgtd` daemon to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition for iSCSI target services. The memory corruption can also make the daemon unstable.
- **Potential for other exploitation:** While primarily leading to a crash, memory corruption can be a starting point for other forms of exploitation, though this is not explicitly detailed in the provided context.
- The buffer overflow vulnerability allows for a remote, pre-authenticated denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Traffic:** The double-free and buffer overflow is triggered by specific, crafted network traffic sent to the `tgtd` or `iscsid` daemons.
- **Pre-Authentication:** The vulnerabilities can be triggered before successful authentication with the iSCSI target (pre-authentication), making it easier for an attacker to exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers need to have network access to the machine running the vulnerable `tgtd` or `iscsid` daemons.
- **Crafted Network Packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft specific network packets to trigger the double-free or buffer overflow in the iSCSI target.

**Additional Notes:**
- A patch was created by FUJITA Tomonori to address a buffer overflow issue, preventing the exploit by checking if the incoming data isn't larger than `INCOMING_BUFSIZE`.
- Red Hat released RHSA-2011:0332 to address this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.
- Debian also issued DSA-2209-1, which fixes the double free in tgt for the stable and unstable distributions.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v2 base score of 5.0 (Medium) as per the openSUSE Security Summary Report SUSE-SR:2011:009.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**
- A double-free vulnerability exists within the `tgt` daemon, potentially leading to crashes and denial of service via crafted network traffic.
- A pre-authentication buffer overflow issue exists in the `iscsid` daemon that allows for remote denial of service by sending oversized packets.
