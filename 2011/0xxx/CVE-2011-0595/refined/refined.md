  "related": true,
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an unbounded decompression in the handling of textures within the Universal 3D (U3D) compressed file format. During the decompression of RLE-compressed data, the application uses a specified size for allocating the destination buffer. However, it doesn't properly check if the decompressed data exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Unbounded Decompression"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system under the context of the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file containing a specially crafted U3D texture."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious file or webpage that contains a U3D texture with an RLE stream designed to cause a buffer overflow during decompression. The victim must then interact with the malicious file or webpage.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code is specifically in how Adobe Reader handles the decompression of texture data within a U3D file. The vulnerability arises because the software trusts the data being decompressed to fit into the allocated buffer, which is not guaranteed and allows for a buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered by RLE (Run Length Encoded) decompression within the U3D image processing routines."
