{
  "cveId": "CVE-2011-0057",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Mozilla Firefox when using Web Workers, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
  "details": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how nsAutoJSValHolder manages JavaScript values within Web Workers. The nsAutoJSValHolder class was not correctly rooting the jsval, allowing the garbage collector to free an object while a Web Worker still held a reference to it.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Incorrect jsval rooting"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the browser.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Malicious webpage",
      "JavaScript Web Worker"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "An attacker would need to create a malicious webpage with JavaScript that can trigger the use-after-free condition by exploiting the Web Workers API and manipulating object references to be garbage collected prematurely.",
    "additionalNotes": "The issue was identified and fixed quickly, with patches applied to multiple versions of Firefox and SeaMonkey. The bug report includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the vulnerability. The vulnerability is also present in older versions of Firefox (3.6) and is considered exploitable."
