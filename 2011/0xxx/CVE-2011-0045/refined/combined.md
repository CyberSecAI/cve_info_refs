**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode and take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take complete control over the affected system.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Workstations and terminal servers are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the Windows kernel properly validates the user-supplied data before allocating memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

# Advisory Details

February 8th, 2011
## Microsoft Windows WmiTraceMessageVa Local Kernel Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-064ZDI-CAN-890

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-0045](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0045) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 6.8, [AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Windows XP](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-xp/) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code from the context of kernelspace on vulnerable installations of Microsoft Windows. The ability to make a system call is required in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the kernel's support for Trace Events. Due to a bad type conversion, the kernel will use a truncated length for allocating data from userspace. When populating this buffer the kernel will use a differing length causing a buffer overflow. This will cause memory corruption and can lead to code execution under the context of the kernel. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Microsoft has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms11-011.mspx> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-09-29 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2011-02-08 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
