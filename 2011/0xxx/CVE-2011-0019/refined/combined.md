| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=666076#c0)  Adrian Bridgett    2010-12-28 20:13:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 470999](attachment.cgi?id=470999 "full backtrace") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=470999&action=edit "full backtrace") full backtrace  Description of problem: slapd crashed  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): 1.2.7.5-1.el5 (x86_64)  How reproducible: just once so far (but has happened on earlier versions)  Steps to Reproduce: 1. run slapd 2. wait a day, a week 3. panic  Additional info: Here's a short backtrace and full backtrace (attached).  May well be a dupe of 656734, but I thought it might be easier to raise separately and merge if needs be rather than put it in and find that was wrong.  An automated upgrade (now disabled) upgraded us from 1.2.7.1 to 1.2.7.4 which caused us major problems due to the memory leak.  I had to revert to 1.2.7.1 and we did see a few crashes, I've now upgraded to 1.2.7.5 (hoping that perhaps it was some incompatibility between 1.2.7.1 and data touched by 1.2.7.4) however it's just crashed.  I do wonder if we need to rebuild the indexes, I've also not run a dbverify yet.

I suppose you could work around the problem by increasing your lookthrough limit.  I was unable to reproduce by simply making a search hit the limit.  The stack trace sure looks like it is doing a free of already freed memory or perhaps uninitialized memory.  Looking at the code, I don't know where this could happen.  How many entries should be returned from the search?  That is, how many match base dc=public,dc=people,dc=ds,dc=example,dc=com scope subtree filter (&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(memberOf=*Enterprise*)) ?  If you can reproduce it easily, would you be able to run valgrind on this server to get more detailed memory access debugging?  It will slow the server somewhat.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=666076#c3)  Adrian Bridgett    2011-01-06 08:56:10 UTC  ``` Hi Rich, thanks for looking at this.  We are going to perform a nice big cleanup of LDAP in the not-too-distant future since it's not setup very well ATM.  Currently there are 3443 entries returned by the query (a plain ldapsearch is showing success - shouldn't it be reporting that it hit lookthrough limit?)  Oddly we also have this set in the DB (would it be useful to attach dse.ldif or a dump of cn=config?): dn: cn=config,cn=ldbm database,cn=plugins,cn=config nsslapd-lookthroughlimit: -1  Under dc=public,dc=people,dc=ds,dc=example,dc=com there are 97617 entries (post-cleanup this will drop probably to those 3443 entries and not much else).  We do have scripts which sync other systems to LDAP (as well as syncing other systems from LDAP).  One thing I've seen those (legacy) scripts do is update all the attributes (even if they are _already_ set to the correct value) - so there are likely to be lots of updates happening from time to time.  We definitely couldn't run valgrind on this box, it's pushed quite hard as it is.  I can look at running it on a separate test box and I could run half of those update scripts (the ones that update LDAP - I couldn't run the ones that update other systems from LDAP as we don't have a full test environment yet).

We are going to perform a nice big > cleanup of LDAP in the not-too-distant future since it's not setup very well > ATM.  Currently there are 3443 entries returned by the query (a plain > ldapsearch is showing success - shouldn't it be reporting that it hit > lookthrough limit?)  It depends on what you mean by "plain ldapsearch".  The search filter is the critical factor in determining when the lookthrough limit is hit.  If by "plain" you mean "running ldapsearch without specifying a search filter" then the default search filter of "objectclass=*" is used.  Are you running the search as directory manager or a regular user?  lookthrough limit does not apply to directory manager.  >  > Oddly we also have this set in the DB (would it be useful to attach dse.ldif or > a dump of cn=config?): > dn: cn=config,cn=ldbm database,cn=plugins,cn=config > nsslapd-lookthroughlimit: -1  This means to use the default value of lookthrough limit which is 5000.   > Under dc=public,dc=people,dc=ds,dc=example,dc=com there are 97617 entries > (post-cleanup this will drop probably to those 3443 entries and not much else).  So because of the search filter (&(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)(memberOf=*Enterprise*)) it has to look through all (or at least more than 5000) of the 97617 entries to find a match.  >  > We do have scripts which sync other systems to LDAP (as well as syncing other > systems from LDAP).

Can you paste excerpts from your directory server access log from around the time of the crash?  We can try to see if there are other operations happening at the time of the search.  The core dump did not show any operations other than the search request.  The access log is buffered by default for performance reasons, so it may be that what we are looking for was not written to disk before the crash.  You can turn off access log buffering, but that will also impact performance somewhat.  <http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Configuration_and_Command-Line_Tool_Reference/Core_Server_Configuration_Reference.html#cnconfig-nsslapd_accesslog_logbuffering_Log_Buffering>  and see also  <http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html-single/Administration_Guide/index.html#using-named-pipe>  >  > We definitely couldn't run valgrind on this box, it's pushed quite hard as it > is.

The directory server access log (sans buffering) could tell us what's going on.  Do all of these cores have the same thread stack traces?  If you like, you can attach the full stack traces from all of these cores to this bug.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=666076#c5)  Adrian Bridgett    2011-01-06 17:50:31 UTC  ``` I'm was running ldapsearch without any filters, not as the directory owner but I an in the ldap administrators group.

We use quite a range I'm afraid: - RHEL5 boxes with LDAP authentication: -- nss_ldap-253-25.el5_5.3  (just chose one box out of many, they are all rhel5) - Java applications JDK 1.6 (Sun JNDI LDAP service provider) - apache using mod_auth*_ldap (RHEL5 httpd 2.2.3-43.el5_5.3) - bespoke perl code (Net::LDAP v0.39) - openldap client (ldapsearch) - apache directory studio   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=666076#c16)  Rich Megginson    2011-01-13 18:48:51 UTC  ``` It has to be some application that can * open a connection * issue async operations on the connection * issue Simple Paged Search requests  That rules out nss_ldap, mod_auth_ldap, openldap client  so, could be JNDI apps, Net::LDAP perl code, and apache directory studio  I have been able to reproduce the crash by issuing multiple simultaneous Simple Paged Search requests on the same connection (using python-ldap).  I have also found a workaround - just set nsslapd-maxthreadsperconn: 1 in cn=config in your dse.ldif - you have to shutdown the server first before editing dse.ldif.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=666076#c17)  Adrian Bridgett    2011-01-17 09:35:21 UTC  ``` Thanks Rich,   I made that change on Friday morning and it's not crashed since. I think the Net::LDAP perl is the most likely culprit TBH as it performs some (horribly inefficient - e.g. modifying attributes and setting them to their current values...) synchronisation from a bespoke system to LDAP.   I'll keep an eye on it to see if it crashes but I thought you might appreciate confirmation that the workaround seems to be working here as well.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=666076#c18)  Rich Megginson    2011-01-18 16:54:20 UTC  ``` Good to know the workaround works for you - thanks for the update.

The new function pagedresults_check_or_set_processing() will     check the flag in the connection to see if pagedresults processing is in     progress.  If so, the function will return True and the search will terminat     with LDAP_UNWILLING_TO_PERFORM (as per section 3 in RFC 2696, a server is     allowed to return unwillingToPerform if there is a limit to the number of     outstanding paged search requests from a given client).  The processing     flag will be reset once the search result has been sent to the client.     Since the problem is multiple threads in the same connection accessing     the pagedresults data, the workaround is to just set      nsslapd-maxthreadsperconn: 1     in cn=config in dse.ldif.     Platforms tested: RHEL6 x86_64     Flag Day: no     Doc impact: no To ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/389/ds.git    1847a51..5d4895c  389-ds-base-1.2.8 -> 389-ds-base-1.2.8 commit 5d4895c4d6a412476f4b831e1d0654931c3934f9 Author: Rich Megginson <rmeggins> Date:   Thu Jan 13 13:44:15 2011 -0700   ``` |  |
