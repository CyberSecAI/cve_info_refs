Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0709:

**Vulnerability Description:**

CVE-2011-0709 is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the Linux kernel's bridge networking code, specifically within the multicast handling functionality (`br_multicast`).

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises because a NULL check was removed from the `br_mdb_ip_get` function. This function is responsible for retrieving multicast database entries. When an IGMP packet is received and no multicast table is allocated, the missing NULL check results in a dereference of a NULL pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Missing NULL check:** The primary weakness is the absence of a check to ensure that the multicast database (`mdb`) pointer is not NULL before attempting to access its members.
-   **Uninitialized memory:** If the multicast table is not allocated, the `mdb` pointer will be NULL, leading to a crash when code tries to access it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Kernel Panic/Denial of Service:** Exploitation of this vulnerability results in a kernel NULL pointer dereference, leading to a kernel panic and a denial of service. The affected system becomes unresponsive and requires a reboot.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Network Packets:** The attack vector is network-based, triggered by receiving an IGMP packet when the multicast database table has not been allocated. This can be triggered by simply sending a specific IGMP packet, meaning an attacker can trigger the issue remotely on a system that has the vulnerable code active.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the target system, specifically IGMP multicast packets.
-   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require authentication, meaning any attacker that can send network packets to a vulnerable system can cause a kernel panic.

**Technical Details:**

-   **Affected Code:** The vulnerable code is located in `net/bridge/br_multicast.c` within the Linux kernel.
-   **Vulnerable Function:** The primary vulnerable function is `br_mdb_ip_get`, specifically when it calls `__br_mdb_ip_get` without checking if the `mdb` variable is NULL.
-   **Patch:** The fix involves restoring the NULL check within the `br_mdb_ip_get` function, ensuring that the function returns early if the `mdb` is NULL, preventing the null dereference.
-   **Affected Kernel Versions:** This vulnerability was introduced in the Linux kernel 2.6.35-rc1 and fixed in 2.6.35-rc5. Linux versions between those two are affected.
-   **Specific functions involved:** `__br_ip4_hash`, `br_mdb_ip_get`, `br_multicast_leave_group`, `br_multicast_rcv`.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability was introduced by mistake and was quickly fixed.
-   There is some debate on whether a CVE ID should be assigned to issues only occurring in development snapshots.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing NULL check when accessing the multicast database, allowing a remote attacker to cause a kernel panic. The vulnerability was present in Linux kernels versions between 2.6.35-rc1 and 2.6.35-rc5.
