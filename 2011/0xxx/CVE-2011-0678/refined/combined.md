## Lomtec ActiveWeb Professional 3.0 CMS allows arbitrary file upload and execution

#### Vulnerability Note VU#528212

Original Release Date: 2011-01-25 | Last Revised: 2011-01-25

---

### Overview

Lomtec ActiveWeb Professional 3.0 web content management server allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files.

### Description

| According to Lomtec's [website](http://www.lomtec.com/en/ActiveWeb/d/activeweb/basic_info.html): "*Lomtec ActiveWeb offers an ideal solution for the creation, maintenance and administration of a Web site and its content.*" Lomtec ActiveWeb Professional 3.0 web content management server, running on ColdFusion, allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files. By accessing the "getImagefile" section of the EasyEdit module, a remote attacker could upload an executable server-side script (e.g., an .asp shell on a Microsoft Internet Information Server platform) and execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web content management server. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By uploading a file that can be executed by the web server (e.g., an .asp shell), a remote, authenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web content management server. |
| --- |

### Solution

| We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. |
| --- |

| **Restrict Access**Limit network access to hosts that require connections to the web content management server. Do not allow access to the web content management server from untrusted networks such as the internet.**Filter URLs**Using a reverse HTTP proxy, web server URL filtering, or similar technology, it may be possible to restrict the names and extensions of files that can be uploaded to the web content management server.**Modify Web Server Permissions**It may be possible to modify web content management server permissions to prevent file uploads. This may impact web content management server functionality. |

# City of Gold and Mega Moolah: Your Path to Slot Victories

Feb 17, 2024

![Skull Duggery](https://b1370496.smushcdn.com/1370496/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Skull-Duggery-1080x675.png?lossy=2&strip=1&webp=1)

The worst thing which I like is waiting of something. I was on Adelaide airport with my ticket waiting for the flight to go the desired vacation spot on an island which was delayed by three hours. During that time I started reading a book of very famous author which was based on some drama [comic](http://www.loc.gov/rr/news/coll/049.html). After sometime it was announced that the flight was delayed by six hours which made me hectic to pass off my time. A person beside me was playing some [pokie](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/age/agemov.html) game which compelled me to for this if I really want to make my spare time in a good mood. I went for the search and found Skull Duggery the most pleasant one and without wasting a moment I went for the download of the full paid app on my [android mobile](http://www.bom.gov.au/uv/iphoneapp.shtml).

This is a [video slot](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/poker-revenue-source-for-governments/) which is pirate themed with nine payline. I had watched a movie and its series which also used the concept of pirate with the similar characters which had been used in the game. The superb quality which really made it popular among the average bettor is that they can start with the super low of $0.01 to $1.00 at each of the lines and may bet with the max of five coins at each slot. The most typical thing which I liked about this game was the symbols which were related to the food. The winning combination of this one also gives some multiplier which can be used in proceeding stage. The animated icon of robber which is the wild symbol will take you in the round of bonus and gives you the maximum chance to win some prizes and even some amount of real cash too which will make you to stuck in its world.

### Mega Moolah Mad: Overview

You may have been [playing slots](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/unintentional-clash-with-arabian-nights-slot-machines/) for some time and wondered what it would feel like to win one of the Mega Jackpots. The Mega Moolah universe is the one thing that doesn’t need explanation. Microgaming’s progressive Jackpot network has awarded over EUR1.1 billion in prizes, including more than EUR26 million this year. More than 150 players have taken home EUR10,000 or higher. A player won the impressive Jackpot of EUR10 735 716.84 on Sunday, April 5. Let’s look at what it would be like if we won this.

We’ll now return to the basics and take a closer look at the Mega Moolah version. Microgaming’s Triple Edge Studios developed the slot. It bears the intriguing title Mega Moolah Absolootly mad. The words “Mega” or “Moolah” will likely be enough to attract many players in a short time. Although most players will not win the big win, it is worth looking at what else the game has to offer. It’s something to be proud of.

Triple Edge has teamed up with another game developer to create a unique theme for the game’s gameplay. Although this isn’t the foremost time a company has done this, they did a great job recreating the wild Mega Moohla world. The giant mushrooms and Wonderland imagery displayed on the reels make this an awe-inspiring game. Mad features are the 3-row, 5-reel layout. Three or more matching symbols on the first reel, and one on each row, are winning combinations. There are 243 ways to win.

The game has ten regular symbols, including four low win symbols and six high win symbols.

Card symbols that appear in a row are the best way to win low. The most lucrative themes include a pocket watch or a cup of tea, a butterfly, or a white rabbit sitting on top of a cake. Although it looks pretty bizarre, the hat maker is the best-paying symbol. It pays ten times as much for five identical symbols. Mega Jackpots can be won at any level of bet. Participation is available starting at 20 cents per spin. However, you can wager up to 50 Euros per spin. The chances of the [Jackpot Wheel](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/get-regular-slots-for-online-players/) being activated are higher if the bet is higher.

Let’s look at the RTP, which is typically low when you can win massive jackpots by playing slots. The RTP for a progressive jackpot this large is 92.02%. Let’s face it, the RTP and RTP are irrelevant to most players who tune in to Absolootly mad to play – the Jackpot reigns supreme. The volatility has been kept at a moderate level, with a win rate above 32%.

The rolling reels feature dissipates winning symbols, allowing new symbols to land on empty spaces. This increases the probability of the player winning. Rolling Reels will continue to run as long as there are new pay lines. The multiplier trail is also included in this process. After the initial win, the multiplier increases to x1, x2, and x3 with every slide. It can reach a maximum of 5×5. The multiplier resets when the slider is removed, and the next spin begins.

The second feature is the round of 8 free games. This feature is activated when three gates appear. Free spins have a multiplier trail that starts at x3 but can increase to x6, nine, or even x15. You can get up to 48 extra free spins. The Mega Moolah Jackpot feature is next. You will need the wild symbol “Sombrero” with the golden crown. It can replace all symbols and triggers [Free Spins](https://www.exploitdevelopment.com/vulnerabilities/2010-M%24-001.html). Each time a wild symbol appears on the reels, it is added to the Jackpot. The progressive wheel may activate if a Rolling Reels feature has been completed. If this happens, the Jackpot Wheel will start. It will be divided into 20 segments. One of these is the Mega Jackpot.

#### The four jackpots have a minimum win value of:

* Mini Jackpot starts at 10 euro
* The minor Jackpot starts at EUR100
* The largest Jackpot begins at EUR10,000
* Mega Jackpot starts at EUR1,000,000

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
