| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-07 14:51:17 UTC  ``` Following patch was applied to glibc packages to address dynamic linker privilege escalation issue [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) (see [bug #643306](show_bug.cgi?id=643306 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-3847 glibc: ld.so insecure handling of $ORIGIN in LD_AUDIT for setuid/setgid programs")):  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c26> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b646a51f13fd6816c483fb24c308a13264c6d1a>  This change introduced a regression in handling of privileged programs that use $ORIGIN in R*PATH in the binary itself, or any of the depending libraries.  When running such privileged program, this issue causes dynamic linker to not expand $ORIGIN in R*PATH and search for additional dynamic objects starting from the current working directory.  This could allow a local user to escalate their privileges, or cause the program to fail to find required libraries.  Prior to the [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847), it was possible to escalate privileges when privileged program had $ORIGIN in R*PATH.  An attacker needed to have a write access to the file system hosting such binary, to be able to hard-link it to an attacker-controlled directory.  Then the attacker could LD_PRELOAD malicious library from the same directory and execute code with elevated privileges.  This flaw was of limited risk, as setuid/setgid binaries with $ORIGIN in R*PATH seem to be rare (there's no such binary in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).  With the 4b646a51 fix applied, attacker no longer needs write access to the file system with privileged program, and the relative-to-CWD search can be triggered by R*PATHs of depending libraries too.  Even with these loosened requirements, there are currently no privileged programs shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux known to be exploitable using this flaw.  To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was applied in fedora glibc git branch: <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>  Following patch is also required to avoid regressing [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) fix: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c22> <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=22cd1c9bcf57c5829d65b6da825f7a459d40c9eb>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-07 14:55:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0)) > To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was > applied in fedora glibc git branch: > <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>  This fix has not been applied to glibc master branch yet as discussed in the following libc-hacker mailing list thread: <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-hacker/2010-12/msg00001.html>  It seems the change was rejected because it removes useful and desired behaviour of having $ORIGIN supported privileged programs' R*PATHs.

There are two cases here:  - problem with gconv that was introduced as part of [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) fix.  This may lead to privilege escalation if some suid program uses gconv and it's the issue we need to address (e.g. by reverting "Never expand $ORIGIN in privileged programs" and adding "Don't expand DST twice in dl_open")  - second, there are issues that can lead to privilege escalation when you have suid with odd RPATH.  While such suids are not common, users can unintentionally introduce them in their systems and create and exposure that ld.so can (should?) mitigate.  It's probably worth discussing if linked should provide safety net for such cases, or these can be ignored as way too uncommon to be worth changing current status quo.

Subject: CVE request: glibc CVE-2010-3847 fix regression

Hi!

It seems this does not have any CVE assigned yet...

The original patch for CVE-2010-3847, as used by multiple vendors,
introduced a bug in the way $ORIGIN is (not-)expanded when used in ELF
R*PATH.  This could allow a local user to escalate privileges via
privileged program using a library with $ORIGIN in R*PATH (such as
certain glibc iconv modules).

There are at least Debian and Ubuntu advisories addressing this issue:
<http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2011/msg00005.html>
<https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-January/001226.html>

Note that privileged programs that themselves have $ORIGIN in R*PATH
could have been abused before and are not addressed in the above
advisories.  It's unclear if any distro provides any privileged program
with such R*PATH though.

# USN-1009-2: GNU C Library vulnerability

12 January 2011

Privilege escalation via loading of libraries via RPATH DSTs with setuid programs.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)
* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)
* [Ubuntu 9.10](/security/notices?release=karmic)
* [Ubuntu 8.04](/security/notices?release=hardy)

## Packages

* [eglibc](/security/cves?package=eglibc) - Embedded GNU C Library: sources
* [glibc](/security/cves?package=glibc) - GNU C Library: Documentation

## Details

USN-1009-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C library. Colin Watson

discovered that the fixes were incomplete and introduced flaws with

setuid programs loading libraries that used dynamic string tokens in their

RPATH. If the "man" program was installed setuid, a local attacker could

exploit this to gain "man" user privileges, potentially leading to further

privilege escalations. Default Ubuntu installations were not affected.

Original advisory details:

Tavis Ormandy discovered multiple flaws in the GNU C Library's handling

of the LD\_AUDIT environment variable when running a privileged binary. A

local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2010-3847](/security/CVE-2010-3847),

[CVE-2010-3856](/security/CVE-2010-3856))

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3847 CVE-2010-3856

Colin Watson discovered that the update for stable relased in
DSA-2122-1 did not complete address the underlying security issue in
all possible scenarios.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-18lenny7.

For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

----- Original Message -----
> Hi!
>
> It seems this does not have any CVE assigned yet...
>
> The original patch for CVE-2010-3847, as used by multiple vendors,
> introduced a bug in the way $ORIGIN is (not-)expanded when used in ELF
> R*PATH. This could allow a local user to escalate privileges via
> privileged program using a library with $ORIGIN in R*PATH (such as
> certain glibc iconv modules).
>
> There are at least Debian and Ubuntu advisories addressing this issue:
> <http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2011/msg00005.html>
> <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-January/001226.html>
>
> Note that privileged programs that themselves have $ORIGIN in R*PATH
> could have been abused before and are not addressed in the above
> advisories. It's unclear if any distro provides any privileged program
> with such R*PATH though.
