CVE-2010-3847 glibc: ld.so insecure handling of $ORIGIN in LD_AUDIT for setuid/setgid programs\")):\n <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c26>\n <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=4b646a51f13fd6816c483fb24c308a13264c6d1a>\n\n This change introduced a regression in handling of privileged programs that use $ORIGIN in R*PATH in the binary itself, or any of the depending libraries.\n\n When running such privileged program, this issue causes dynamic linker to not expand $ORIGIN in R*PATH and search for additional dynamic objects starting from the current working directory.\n\n This could allow a local user to escalate their privileges, or cause the program to fail to find required libraries.\n\n Prior to the [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847), it was possible to escalate privileges when privileged program had $ORIGIN in R*PATH. An attacker needed to have a write access to the file system hosting such binary, to be able to hard-link it to an attacker-controlled directory. Then the attacker could LD_PRELOAD malicious library from the same directory and execute code with elevated privileges.\n\n This flaw was of limited risk, as setuid/setgid binaries with $ORIGIN in R*PATH seem to be rare (there's no such binary in Red Hat Enterprise Linux).\n\n With the 4b646a51 fix applied, attacker no longer needs write access to the file system with privileged program, and the relative-to-CWD search can be triggered by R*PATHs of depending libraries too.\n\n Even with these loosened requirements, there are currently no privileged programs shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux known to be exploitable using this flaw.\n\n To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was applied in fedora glibc git branch:\n <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>\n\n Following patch is also required to avoid regressing [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) fix:\n <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-3847#c22>\n <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=22cd1c9bcf57c5829d65b6da825f7a459d40c9eb>\n  ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-07 14:55:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0))\n > To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was\n > applied in fedora glibc git branch:\n > <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>\n\n This fix has not been applied to glibc master branch yet as discussed in the following libc-hacker mailing list thread:\n <http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-hacker/2010-12/msg00001.html>\n\n It seems the change was rejected because it removes useful and desired behaviour of having $ORIGIN supported privileged programs' R*PATHs.\n\n The discussion does not seem to mention risks of the feature though.\n\n Andreas, have there been any other off-list discussions of this change?\n  ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 08:38:09 UTC  ``` Public now via Debian advisory DSA 2122-2:\n <http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2011/msg00005.html>\n\n and Ubuntu advisory USN-1009-2:\n <https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-January/001226.html>\n\n using patches listed in [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0).\n  ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 10:32:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c0))\n > To address this issue, 4b646a51 was reverted and the following patch was\n > applied in fedora glibc git branch:\n > <http://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=96611391ad8823ba58405325d78cefeae5cdf699>\n\n F13 glibc-2.12.2-1 ld.so with this patch applied still searches CWD.\n  ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c8)  Andreas Schwab    2011-01-12 14:42:05 UTC  ``` If you can create a suid-root program all bets are off.\n  ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2011-01-12 15:05:34 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #8](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c8))\n > If you can create a suid-root program all bets are off.\n\n There are two cases here:\n\n - problem with gconv that was introduced as part of [CVE-2010-3847](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3847) fix.\n This may lead to privilege escalation if some suid program uses gconv and it's the issue we need to address (e.g. by reverting \"Never expand $ORIGIN in privileged programs\" and adding \"Don't expand DST twice in dl_open\")\n\n - second, there are issues that can lead to privilege escalation when you have suid with odd RPATH.\n While such suids are not common, users can unintentionally introduce them in their systems and create and exposure that ld.so can (should?) mitigate.\n\n It's probably worth discussing if linked should provide safety net for such cases, or these can be ignored as way too uncommon to be worth changing current status quo.\n\n Hence I've created upstream bug that can be used to discuss if current behaviour is appropriate or not:\n  <http://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=12393>\n  ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2011-04-03 20:24:51 UTC  ``` Raising impact rating to important.\n\n Additional exploitation vectors have been demonstrated, which affect common configurations.\n  ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-04 20:06:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:\n\n   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5\n\n Via RHSA-2011:0412 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0412.html>\n  ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-04-04 20:22:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:\n\n   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6\n\n Via RHSA-2011:0413 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0413.html>\n  ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c15)  Leif Nixon    2011-04-05 18:26:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=667974#c12))\n > Raising impact rating to important.

This could allow a local user to escalate privileges via\nprivileged program using a library with $ORIGIN in R*PATH (such as\ncertain glibc iconv modules).\n\nThere are at least Debian and Ubuntu advisories addressing this issue:\n<http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2011/msg00005.html>\n<https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-January/001226.html>\n\nNote that privileged programs that themselves have $ORIGIN in R*PATH\ncould have been abused before and are not addressed in the above\nadvisories.  It's unclear if any distro provides any privileged program\nwith such R*PATH though.\n\n--\nTomas Hoger / Red Hat Security Response Team\n\n```\n\n[Powered by blists](https://www.openwall.com/blists/) - [more mailing lists](https://lists.openwall.net)\n\nPlease check out the\n[Open Source Software Security Wiki](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/), which is counterpart to this\n[mailing list](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security).\n\nConfused about [mailing lists](/lists/) and their use?\n[Read about mailing lists on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_mailing_list)\nand check out these\n[guidelines on proper formatting of your messages](https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/mail-news-errors.html).\n",
