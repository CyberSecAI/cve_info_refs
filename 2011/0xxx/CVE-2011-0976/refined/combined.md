User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists with the way the application will parse external objects within an Office Art container. When parsing this object, the application will append an uninitialized object to a list. When destroying this object during document close (WM\_DESTROY), the application will access a method that doesn't exist. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application. |

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-022 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint Could Allow Remote Code Execution (2489283)

Published: April 12, 2011 | Updated: April 20, 2011

**Version:** 1.1

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves three privately reported vulnerabilities in Microsoft PowerPoint. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user opens a specially crafted PowerPoint file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. The automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution for PowerPoint 2010, "Disable Edit in Protected View for PowerPoint 2010," available in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584), blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-0655 and CVE-2011-0656.

This security update is rated Important for all supported releases of Microsoft PowerPoint; Microsoft Office for Mac; Open XML File Format Converter for Mac; Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats; Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, and Microsoft PowerPoint Web App. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that PowerPoint validates records when opening PowerPoint files. For more information about the vulnerability, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2489283](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2489283) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Related to This Security Update

**Where are the file information details?**

Refer to the reference tables in the **Security Update Deployment** section for the location of the file information details.

**Does this update contain any security-related changes to functionality?**

Yes. The updates for Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 Service Pack 3 (KB2464588) and Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 Service Pack 2 (KB2464594), in conjunction with the update offered in [MS11-023](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210206), provide support for the Office File Validation feature. For more information about the Office File Validation feature, see [Microsoft Security Advisory 2501584](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2501584).

**How is this security update related to MS10-087 and MS10-088?**

The update for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2505924) offered in this bulletin also addresses the vulnerabilities described in the [MS10-087](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=203241) and [MS10-088](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=198186) security bulletins.

**What is the benefit if I apply the Microsoft Fix it solution to disable edit in protected view?**

By setting Office File Validation to not allow editing of suspicious files in PowerPoint 2010, the **Microsoft Fix it** solution, "Disable Edit in Protected View for PowerPoint 2010," blocks the attack vectors for exploiting the vulnerabilities described in CVE-2011-0655 and CVE-2011-0656. Customers may choose to apply the Fix it solution as a workaround if choosing not to install the security update for PowerPoint 2010 until a later time.

Refer to [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2501584](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2501584) for instructions on applying the automated Fix it solution, "Disable Edit in Protected View for PowerPoint 2010," or refer to the Workaround sections for CVE-2011-0655 and CVE-2011-0656 in the Vulnerability Information section of this bulletin for instructions on applying the solution manually.

**MS11-021 and MS11-023 also describe vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac. MS11-021 also describes vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office for Mac 2011. How do MS11-021 and MS11-023 relate to this bulletin (MS11-022)?**

The security update packages for Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac (KB2505924), Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac (KB2505927), and Open XML File Format Converter for Mac (KB2505935) offered in this bulletin also address the vulnerabilities described in the [MS11-021](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210121) and [MS11-023](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210206) security bulletins. The security update package for Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 (KB2525412) offered in this bulletin also addresses the vulnerabilities described in [MS11-021](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=210121). Users with Microsoft Office 2004 for Mac, Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac, Open XML File Format Converter for Mac, or Microsoft Office for Mac 2011 installed will only need to install these security update packages once.

**Why does this update address several reported security vulnerabilities?**

This update contains support for several vulnerabilities because the modifications that are required to address these issues are located in related files. Instead of having to install several updates that are almost the same, customers need to install this update only.

**What is Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer?**

Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer, which is based on Microsoft Office 2010 technology, is a replacement for Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007 Service Pack 2. Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer lets you view full-featured presentations created in Microsoft PowerPoint 97 and later versions.

**I use the "Package a Presentation for CD" feature. How can I help ensure my presentations are protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin?**

After applying this security update to affected software, customers running supported editions of Microsoft PowerPoint 2003 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2007 can issue updated versions of their presentations created using the [Package a Presentation for CD](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/828504) feature in PowerPoint to help ensure that the PowerPoint Viewer included in their presentations is protected from the vulnerabilities described in this bulletin.

Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 presentations created using the Package a Presentation for CD feature do not include the PowerPoint Viewer.

**What components of the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats are updated by this bulletin?**

The update included with this security bulletin applies only to the specific component within the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats that is affected. For example, in an Excel bulletin, only the Excel compatibility pack component files are included in the update packages and not Word or PowerPoint compatibility pack component files. Word compatibility pack component files are updated in a Word bulletin and PowerPoint compatibility pack component files are updated in a PowerPoint bulletin.

**How are Microsoft Office standalone programs affected by these vulnerabilities?**

A Microsoft Office standalone program is affected with the same severity rating as the corresponding component in a Microsoft Office Suite. For example, a standalone installation of Microsoft PowerPoint is affected with the same severity rating as an installation of Microsoft PowerPoint that was delivered with a Microsoft Office Suite.

**The Microsoft Office component discussed in this article is part of the Microsoft Office Suite that I have installed on my system; however, I did not choose to install this specific component. Will I be offered this update?**

Yes, if the component discussed in this bulletin was delivered with the version of the Microsoft Office Suite installed on your system, the system will be offered updates for it whether the component is installed or not. The detection logic used to scan for affected systems is designed to check for updates for all components that were delivered with the particular Microsoft Office Suite and to offer the updates to a system. Users who choose not to apply an update for a component that is not installed, but is delivered with their version of the Microsoft Office Suite, will not increase the security risk of that system. On the other hand, users who do choose to install the update will not have a negative impact on the security or performance of a system.

**Does the offer to update a non-vulnerable version of Microsoft Office constitute an issue in the Microsoft update mechanism?**

No, the update mechanism is functioning correctly in that it detects a lower version of the files on the system than in the update package and thus, offers the update.

**I am using an older release of the software discussed in this security bulletin. What should I do?**

The affected software listed in this bulletin have been tested to determine which releases are affected. Other releases are past their support life cycle. For more information about the product lifecycle, visit the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21742) Web site.

It should be a priority for customers who have older releases of the software to migrate to supported releases to prevent potential exposure to vulnerabilities. To determine the support lifecycle for your software release, see [Select a Product for Lifecycle Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169555). For more information about service packs for these software releases, see [Lifecycle Supported Service Packs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=89213).

Customers who require custom support for older software must contact their Microsoft account team representative, their Technical Account Manager, or the appropriate Microsoft partner representative for custom support options. Customers without an Alliance, Premier, or Authorized Contract can contact their local Microsoft sales office. For contact information, visit the [Microsoft Worldwide Information](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=33329) Web site, select the country in the Contact Information list, and then click **Go** to see a list of telephone numbers. When you call, ask to speak with the local Premier Support sales manager. For more information, see the [Microsoft Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=169557).

## Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Microsoft PowerPoint handles specially crafted PowerPoint files. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by creating a specially crafted PowerPoint file that could be included as an e-mail attachment, or hosted on a specially crafted or compromised Web site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0655](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0655).

#### Mitigating Factors for Floating Point Techno-color Time Bandit RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0655

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must open an attachment that is sent in an e-mail message.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* In Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, the possibility of an attacker's success in exploiting this vulnerability is reduced due to the protections afforded by the Office File Validation feature enabled in Microsoft Office 2010 by default. Specially crafted files used to exploit the vulnerability open in Protected View and the user is warned that the file is unsafe and potentially harmful because the file failed validation. A user would have to click through multiple warnings and then open the file for editing or saving before the vulnerability could be exploited. For more information about Protected View and Office File Validation, see the TechNet article, [Security Overview for Office 2010](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc179050.aspx).

  **Note**  Turning off Office File Validation in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 would remove the protections provided by Office File Validation as a mitigating factor. For this reason, Microsoft recommends not turning off the Office File Validation feature in Microsoft PowerPoint 2010.

  `"BinaryFiles"=dword:00000000`
* **Use the Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) when opening files from unknown or untrusted sources**

  The Microsoft Office Isolated Conversion Environment (MOICE) helps protect Office 2003 installations by more securely opening Word, Excel, and PowerPoint binary format files.

  To install MOICE, you must have Office 2003 or Office 2007 installed.

  To install MOICE, you must also have the Compatibility Pack for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint 2007 File Formats. The compatibility pack is available as a free download from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?familyid=941b3470-3ae9-4aee-8f43-c6bb74cd1466&displaylang=en).

  MOICE requires all updates that are recommended for all Office programs. Visit [Microsoft Update](https://update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx) to install all recommended updates.

  **Enable MOICE**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  To manually enable MOICE, run the commands as specified in the following table. Running the commands will associate the Office application extensions with MOICE.

  | Command to enable MOICE to be the registered handler |
  | --- |
  | For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=oice.word.document |
  | For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .XLS=oice.excel.sheet\ ASSOC .XLT=oice.excel.template\ ASSOC .XLA=oice.excel.addin |
  | For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .PPT=oice.powerpoint.show\ ASSOC .POT=oice.powerpoint.template\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow |

  **Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.

  For more information on MOICE, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 935865](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/935865).

  **Impact of workaround.** Office 2003 and earlier formatted documents that are converted to the Microsoft Office 2007 Open XML format by MOICE will not retain macro functionality. Additionally, documents with passwords or that are protected with Digital Rights Management cannot be converted.

  **How to undo the workaround.** Run the commands to disable MOICE as specified in the table below.

  | Command to disable MOICE as the registered handler |
  | --- |
  | For Word, run the following command from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .doc=Word.Document.8 |
  | For Excel, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .xls=Excel.Sheet.8\ ASSOC .xlt=Excel.Template\ ASSOC .xla=Excel.Addin |
  | For PowerPoint, run the following commands from a command prompt:\ ASSOC .ppt=PowerPoint.Show.8\ ASSOC .PPS=oice.powerpoint.slideshow\ ASSOC .pps=PowerPoint.SlideShow.8 |

  **Note** On Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, run the above commands from an elevated command prompt.
* **Do not open PowerPoint documents from untrusted sources**

  Do not open PowerPoint files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources. This vulnerability could be exploited when a user opens a specially crafted file.

#### FAQ for OfficeArt Atom RCE Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0976

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when PowerPoint reads an invalid record in a specially crafted PowerPoint file, causing an error that could corrupt memory in such a way as to allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**What is the component affected by this vulnerability?**

Microsoft PowerPoint is the component affected by this vulnerability.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system in the context of the current logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

Exploitation of this vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted PowerPoint file with an affected version of Microsoft PowerPoint.

In a Web-based attack scenario, a Web site could contain a specially crafted PowerPoint file that is used to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit the Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site and open the specially crafted PowerPoint file, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to open the specially crafted PowerPoint file.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially-crafted PowerPoint file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where an affected version of Microsoft PowerPoint is used, such as workstations and terminal servers, are primarily at risk. Servers could be at more risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update modifies the way that PowerPoint validates OfficeArt records when opening PowerPoint files.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
