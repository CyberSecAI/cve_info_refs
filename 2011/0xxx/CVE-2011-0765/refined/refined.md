Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0765:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Layer Four Traceroute (lft) parses command-line arguments. A specific set of arguments can trigger a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper command-line argument parsing.
- Segmentation fault due to the crafted arguments.
- Potential privilege escalation when the program is setuid root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If `lft` is installed setuid root, a local attacker can exploit the vulnerability to gain elevated privileges.
- Denial of service due to segmentation fault

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker
- Command-line arguments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `lft` binary on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to specify command-line arguments to `lft`

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Layer Four Traceroute 3.x and possibly earlier versions.
- Some distributions may not be vulnerable because they do not install the 'lft' binary as SETUID root by default.
- A fix was released in version 3.3
