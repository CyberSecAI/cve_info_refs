```

Russell Sim discovered a serious security vulnerability in development
release 0.8.0 of nss-pam-ldapd that allows authentication with an
incorrect password for local user accounts.

The PAM module will erroneously return a success code when the user
cannot be found in LDAP. Exploitability depends on the details of the
PAM configuration but on systems that don't use the minimum_uid PAM
option it may be possible to log in to any local account, including
root.

This problem only affects the 0.8.0 development release of
nss-pam-ldapd. Earlier releases are not affected.

This problem has been assigned CVE-2011-0438.

More details are available at:
<http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/news.html#20110309>

Affected users are advised to apply the attached patch, upgrade to 0.8.1
(which will be released shortly), downgrade to 0.7.13 or disable
nss-pam-ldapd's PAM module.

<pre><pre>This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes the collected smaller improvements and bugfixes over the last
two years. This release should be considered stable.
The pynslcd implementation still is not considered as stable as nslcd.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.11:
\* allow explicitly configuring an empty search base (for LDAP servers
that support that)
\* support LDAP attributes with minus characters in attribute mapping
expressions
\* add tls\_reqsan, tls\_crlfile and tls\_crlcheck options (thanks
Sebastien Blavier)
\* support generating ldaps:// URIs from DNS SRV records for port 389 by
using DNSLDAPS in the uri option
\* prefer the first URI listed in nslcd.conf after reconnecting after
idle\_timelimit
\* fix handling of pam\_authc\_ppolicy no
\* fix debug logging of ldap timeout values
\* documentation improvements (thanks Filip Dvorak and Benedict
Reuschling)
\* add pam\_authc\_ppolicy support to pynslcd
\* fix Python 3 compatibility in chsh.ldap
\* fix for running pynslcd without the uid option
\* partial support for running tests with slapd 2.5 (thanks Ryan Tandy)
\* miscellaneous test suite improvements
\* test suite fixes for Solaris
This will be the last release that will be tested on Solaris as it is
increasingly difficult to do so. Existing support for building on
Solaris will be retained for now.

nss-pam-ldapd ending support on the 0.7 series

<pre><pre>
Because the latest 0.8 release is now well over 5 years stable and the
0.9 series is stable for about 3 years, from this point forward the 0.7
series of nss-pam-ldapd will no longer be supported.
The 0.8 series will remain supported for some time with security fixes
and major bug fixes as needed. The 0.9 series will also receive other
bug fixes and enhancements.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest 0.9 release because
stability is at least comparable to 0.8 and a lot more useful features
were added such as tunable logging, nested groups, password policy
support, invalidating caches and more powerful attribute mapping
expressions.

This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes a number of improvements. This branch will see more development
and features added, although it does seem to stabilise somewhat.
However, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
care. The 0.8 branch will remain to be supported with bug and security
fixes for some time.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.2:
\* make the dn2uid cache lifetime configurable with the cache
configuration option
\* have the nslcd process only exit after the service is
completely available to avoid race conditions in the init
script
\* the nslcd daemon now properly daemonises (double fork)
\* support mapping the member attribute to an empty string to
disable the functionality to do extra lookups for member DN
to member uid translations
\* implement deref control handling to request the LDAP server
to dereference group member attribute values to uid values
\* support getting built-in groups from Active Directory (thanks
Davy Defaud)
\* fix for pwdLastSet attribute value handling (thanks Joshua
Shire)
\* fix a possible crash in the NSS module when retrieving large
networks entries (thanks Lukas Slebodnik)
\* correct NSS h\_errnop return value to indicate buffer too
small (thanks Nalin Dahyabhai)
\* fix a bug with shadow values on 64-bit architectures (only
present in 0.9 series)
\* automatically detect DragonFly as using the FreeBSD NSS
interface (thanks Francois Tigeot)
\* add a build-time test to see if krb5 is thread-safe
\* various minor bug fixes

This is an update for the 0.7 series that includes fixes for a few
issues. The changes should be minimal and have mostly been available in
the 0.8 branch for some time.
From this point on, the 0.7 series will only get updates for serious
(security) issues. Users are encouraged to upgrade the the more
up-to-date 0.8 or 0.9 series.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.18:
\* use the more portable EBADF instead of EBADFD (thanks Steven
Chamberlain)
\* fix buffer overflow on interrupted read that is hard to
trigger (thanks John Sullivan)
\* extra sanity check to ensure not too many file descriptors
are open

This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes a number of improvements. This release includes a number of
improvements to the tests and to portability. This branch will see more
development and features added.
As such, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
caution. The 0.8 branch will remain to be supported with bug and
security fixes for some time and is the recommended branch for
production deployments.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.1:
\* increase password value buffer size (by Bersl)
\* avoid more broken pipe errors by using a low timeout when
aborting reading requested information from nslcd (thanks
John Sullivan)
\* only log broken pipe errors in debugging mode
\* fix buffer overflow on interrupted read that is hard to
trigger (thanks John Sullivan)
\* use clock\_gettime() with CLOCK\_MONOTONIC for timeout
calculations to avoid clock adjustments errors (thanks John
Sullivan)
\* extend test suite to test for CLOCK\_MONOTONIC and timed IO
timeout calculations
\* increase the maximum number of base statements per map to 31
\* use larger nslcd send buffers to reduce the number of write
operations in nslcd and consequently the number of reads in
the NSS and PAM modules (thanks John Sullivan)
\* also run invalidators after first successful search
\* various clean-ups, portability improvements and fixes for
compiler warnings
\* import configure checks of Python modules
\* provide a script for setting up slapd in a test environment,
automatically loaded with the required test data
\* add script for evaluating test environment availability
\* portability improvements in the test scripts and test
environment

This is an update for the 0.9 development branch of nss-pam-ldapd that
includes a number of new features. This branch will see more development
and features added.
As such, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
caution. The 0.7 and 0.8 branches will remain to be supported with bug
and security fixes for some time.
A summary of the changes since 0.9.0:
\* rename the nscd\_invalidate option to reconnect\_invalidate and allow
flushing the nfsidmap cache with the new option
\* implement an -n switch to not daemonise (by Caleb Callaway)
\* nslcd will now return partial shadow information to non-root users to
avoid authorisation problems with setgid shadow authentication helpers
with some PAM stacks
\* nslcd will now retry failing LDAP connections after receiving SIGUSR1
(SIGUSR1 could be sent after re-establishing a network connection)
\* fix the way manual pages are installed in some situations
\* the code for the nslcd utilities (getent.ldap and chsh.ldap) is now
installed in {prefix}/share/nslcd-utils
\* improve error and help output of the getent.ldap command
\* documentation updates
\* a number of tests were added and existing tests were extended
\* fix for a potential, small memory leak in PAM module regarding
temporary saving of old password
\* a large number of bug fixes and improvements in pynslcd
\* hide passwords from the pynslcd debug output
\* support start\_tls, pam\_password\_prohibit\_message,
nss\_initgroups\_ignoreusers and nss\_min\_uid in pynslcd
\* fix rootpwmodpw handling in pynslcd
\* complete a basic PAM implementation in pynslcd (some things such as
shadow attribute checking remain to be implemented)
\* clean up the caching functionality in pynslcd (functionality is still
disabled)

The pynslcd implementation is becoming more and more featureful and
robust. It should be a reasonable replacement for nslcd in some
environments. The biggest missing features are support for multiple LDAP
servers with fail-over and support for authenticated LDAP connections
for normal operations.
However, pynslcd is still not as well tested as nslcd.
Ideas, comments and patches for functionality are more than welcome.

This is a maintenance update that fixes a number of minor issues most of
which were backported from the 0.9.0 release. Only a few minor new
features were added. This should be a reasonably stable and well tested
release.
A summary of the changes since 0.8.12:
\* include an extra sanity check to ensure not too many file descriptors
are open
\* fix handling of the gid configuration option if it listed before the
uid option
\* fix microsecond timeout calculation (thanks Julien Cristau)
\* return NSS\_STATUS\_TRYAGAIN on zero-length (but not-NULL) buffer
(thanks Jakub Hrozek)
\* provide an \_nss\_ldap\_version symbol in the NSS module to help debug
problems with a newer nslcd
\* retry updating the lastChange attribute with the normal nslcd LDAP
connection if the update with the user's connection failed
\* avoid processing passwd\_byuid requests for uids below nss\_min\_uid
\* fix a few minor or very unlikely to occur memory leaks
\* fix the text representation of shadow information for nscd on Solaris
\* make the way manual pages are built and installed more consistent with
the chosen configure options
\* miscellaneous minor changes, fixes and compatibility improvements

release 0.9.0 of nss-pam-ldapd

<pre><pre>I'm pleased to announce release 0.9.0 of nss-pam-ldapd. The 0.9 branch
is the new development branch of nss-pam-ldapd in which a number of new
features are and will be introduced.
Amongst the most prominent new features are support for nested groups,
utilities for updating user information and handling of password policy
controls.
As such, this isn't the most stable version and should be used with
caution for now. Users are encouraged to test this release and provide
feedback.
The 0.7 and 0.8 branches will remain to be supported with bug and
security fixes for some time. Some of the features that have received
sufficient testing in the 0.9 series may be backported into the 0.8
series.
A summary of the changes since 0.8.13 (some more details below):
\* backwards incompatible change to the communications protocol between
nslcd and NSS and PAM modules to use network byte order to be able to
work on mixed endian multiarch systems and do some restructuring
\* netgroup lookups now makes a distinction between empty netgroups and
non-existing netgroups
\* the PAM protocol is now more consistent (cleaner support for password
modification by root, have all request parameters in the same order
and limit the information returned from the call)
\* request and handle password policy controls on LDAP authentication
\* implement support for nested groups which can be enabled with the
nss\_nested\_groups option (thanks Steve Hill)
\* add a log option to configure log level and logging to plain files
\* add an nscd\_invalidate option to invalidate the nscd cache after
recovering from LDAP connection problems (to clear any negative cache
entries)
\* allow trimming expressions with ${foo#bar} syntax in attribute mapping
expressions (thanks Thorsten Glaser)
\* pynslcd supports trimming expressions with full shell glob matching
\* support password modification in pynslcd
\* support children search scope for systems that have it
\* add a getent.ldap utility to perform nslcd queries bypassing the libc
NSS stack
\* implement functionality for changing user information and provide a
chsh.ldap utility to allow users to change their login shell
\* remove deprecated use\_sasl, reconnect\_tries, reconnect\_maxsleeptime
and tls\_checkpeer options which have been replaced long ago
\* allow names with one character in default validnames option and allow
parentheses (taken from Fedora packages)
\* fall back to updating the lastChange attribute with the normal LDAP
connection
\* dump full nslcd configuration at debug level on start-up
\* export an \_nss\_ldap\_version symbol in the NSS module to make finding
version mismatches easier (the NSS module version is logged from
nslcd)
\* documentation improvements
\* update the coding style for the C source code to follow a more modern
and commonly used coding convention
\* some parts of the code were refactored or rewritten to take into
account the changes within the software (e.g. configuration file
handling, reduction in the number of system calls for normal
communication)
\* numerous smaller fixes
\* portability and robustness improvements to the tests
\* implement lookup\_netgroup and lookup\_shadow test commands for systems
that cannot use getent to query these
\* guess the value for --with-pam-seclib-dir configure option if it is
not specified
\* temporary disable the caching functionality of pynslcd
\* usability improvements in the pynslcd implementation
\* various fixes for Solaris
This version introduces a backwards incompatible protocol change which
means it is no longer possible to use the NSS or PAM module of a
previous release and nslcd from a newer release (or vice versa). Since
these modules are generally loaded once per process, old versions of
these modules could be present in longer running processes when
upgrading.
The protocol has basically been stable since the beginning of the
project and a few inconveniences have piled up. Until the 0.9 series is
stable the protocol may change again in backwards incompatible ways.
This release introduces a switch to a more commonly used C coding style.
Also code was reviewed and refactored to be easier to maintain. This may
make it difficult to port patches. For help with porting or integration
into nss-pam-ldapd, send patches to the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing
list.
As previously announced, Git is now used for revision control and the
Subversion repository will only be used to maintain older releases.
This release includes contributions from many people. I would like to
thank everybody that contributed bug reports, patches and their time to
this release.

<a rel="nofollow" href="http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/">http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/</a>
Some more ideas and features that may be implemented in the 0.9 series
are:
\* see if we can find a proper solution for systems that organise users
differently (e.g. FreeBSD doesn't have shadow information
\* rework the pynslcd caching functionality and get pynslcd
production-ready
\* add more utilities for managing users, groups and other objects in
LDAP (the rootpwmoddn option will probably be renamed to rootmoddn)
\* support a wider range of authentication mechanisms for the protocol
between the NSS module and nslcd (especially useful for the utility
functions)
Ideas, comments and patches for functionality are more than welcome.
Please drop a note on the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing list with any
ideas or patches you may have.

Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD\_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd can lead to a buffer overflow. An
attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to cause a
process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or potentially
execute arbitrary code.
This problem affects all releases before 0.7.18 and 0.8.11.
This problem has been assigned CVE-2013-0288.
More details are available at:
<a rel="nofollow" href="http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/CVE-2013-0288">http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/CVE-2013-0288</a>
Users are advised to apply the appropriate patch or upgrade to 0.8.11 or
0.7.18.

In order to use some of the advantages of a distributed VCS, the
nss-pam-ldapd project is currently slowly moving the development from
Subversion to Git. A migrated Git repository can be cloned with:
git clone <a rel="nofollow" href="http://arthurdejong.org/git/nss-pam-ldapd">http://arthurdejong.org/git/nss-pam-ldapd</a>
At this time, commits are still published primarily in the Subversion
repository and the Git repository is automatically updated. The
development branch will probably be moved to Git soon. At that point,
the development branch will no longer be updated in Subversion.
Work on the 0.7 and 0.8 maintenance branches and the Debian packaging
are expected to remain in Subversion.
The Subversion repository was automatically converted with some manual
clean-ups to properly set the Git tags. Commits originating from
Subversion will retain the git-svn-id information to make it easier to
find references to revision numbers in commit messages.
Some work remains to be done on setting up a web interface to browse the
repository and sending commit emails.
If you have any issue with the Git repository or comments, please do not
hesitate use the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing list.

This is an update for the 0.7 series that includes two file descriptor
related fixes. The changes should be minimal and have mostly been
available in the 0.8 branch for some time.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.17:
\* ensure that select() is not passed a too high file descriptor to avoid
issues when a large number of file descriptors are open (thanks Adrien
Urban)
\* use FD\_CLOEXEC in NSS and PAM modules to ensure that nslcd file
descriptors are not leaked to child processes
The 0.7 series will only occasionally receive further bugfixes and will
not include any new features. Users of the 0.7 series are encouraged to
consider upgrading to a 0.8 release which is now considered stable and
includes a number of enhancements.

A summary of the changes since 0.8.11:
\* fix a problem with the sasl\_canonicalize option that would cause
errors on non-SASL enabled systems
\* ensure that the file descriptors in the NSS and PAM modules for
connecting to nslcd are closed on exec in the process
\* allow attribute options in attribute mapping expressions
\* show reconnect messages when failing over to a different LDAP server
or re-establishing the connection to an LDAP server (the message
accidentally got hidden in 0.7.4)
\* fix a problem with the pw\_class attribute in FreeBSD (fixes 0.8.11)
\* more fixes and improvements for Solaris (running under nscd may still
give problems though)
\* small improvement to PAM error logging
\* provide a pynslcd manual page if pynslcd is built

numerous small improvements and new features the biggest changes are:
\* support for Solaris and FreeBSD
\* introduction of pynslcd, an experimental alternative for nslcd
\* addition of a validnames option
\* checking shadow attributes for PAM authorisation
\* support mapping to the objectSid attribute
\* support pam\_unix when not getting shadow information from LDAP
A summary of the changes since 0.8.9:
\* documentation improvements
\* fix a problem that causes the PAM module to prompt for a new password
even though the old one was wrong
\* log successful password change in nslcd
\* install default configuration file with reduced permissions (further
protection for CVE-2009-1073)

Russell Sim discovered a serious security vulnerability in development
release 0.8.0 of nss-pam-ldapd that allows authentication with an
incorrect password for local user accounts.
The PAM module will erroneously return a success code when the user
cannot be found in LDAP. Exploitability depends on the details of the
PAM configuration but on systems that don't use the minimum\_uid PAM
option it may be possible to log in to any local account, including
root.
This problem only affects the 0.8.0 development release of
nss-pam-ldapd. Earlier releases are not affected.
This problem has been assigned CVE-2011-0438.
More details are available at:

Affected users are advised to apply the attached patch, upgrade to 0.8.1
(which will be released shortly), downgrade to 0.7.13 or disable
nss-pam-ldapd's PAM module.

I'm pleased to announce release 0.8.0 of nss-pam-ldapd. The 0.8 branch
is a new development branch of nss-pam-ldapd in which a number of new
features and implementations are introduced. As such, it isn't the most
stable version of nss-pam-ldapd but users are urged to try out this
release and send feedback.
The 0.7 branch will be supported with bug and security fixes at least
until the 0.8 branch has stabilised.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.13 (some more details further on):
\* include Solaris support developed by Ted C. Cheng of Symas Corporation
\* include an experimental partial implementation of nslcd in Python
(disabled by default, see --enable-pynslcd configure option)
\* implement a nss\_min\_uid option to filter user entries returned by LDAP
\* implement a rootpwmodpw option that allows the root user to change a
user's password without a password prompt
\* try to update the shadowLastChange attribute on password change
\* all log messages now include a description of the request to more
easily track problems when not running in debug mode
\* allow attribute mapping expressions for the userPassword attribute for
passwd, group and shadow entries and by default map it to the
unmatchable password (&quot;\*&quot;) to avoid accidentally leaking password
information
\* numerous compatibility improvements
\* add --with-pam-seclib-dir and --with-pam-ldap-soname configure options
to allow more control of hot to install the PAM module
\* add --with-nss-flavour and --with-nss-maps configure options to
support other C libraries and limit which NSS modules to install
\* allow tilde (~) in user and group names
\* improvements to the timeout mechanism (connections are now actively
timed out using the idle\_timelimit option)
\* set socket timeouts on the LDAP connection to disconnect regardless of
LDAP and possibly TLS handling of connection
\* better disconnect/reconnect handling of error conditions
\* some code improvements and cleanups and several smaller bug fixes
\* all internal string comparisons are now also case sensitive (e.g. for
providing DN to username lookups, etc)
\* signal handling in the daemon was changed to behave more reliable
across different threading implementations
\* nslcd will now always return a positive authorisation result during
authentication to avoid confusing the PAM module when it is only used
for authorisation
\* Debian packaging improvement: implement configuring SASL
authentication using Debconf, based on a patch by Daniel Dehennin

Support for Solaris was kindly provided by Ted C. Cheng of Symas
Corporation but was subsequently updated to simplify the code and to
support both Glibc and Solaris with the same code base. As such, the
current code isn't very well tested and contributions on this are most
welcome. There have been reports of problems with the communication
between the NSS module and nslcd.
The idea with pynslcd is to offer an alternative implementation of nslcd
that has less and easier to maintain code (most modules are about a
third of the size of their C counterpart). This makes it simpler to
implement extra features (e.g. caching). The implementation is currently
still incomplete (mainly missing configuration file parsing, attribute
mapping, proper logging and the rpc, network, netgroup, service,
protocol and hostname maps) but work is under way and it already passes
most of the basic tests in the test environment.
Some more features that may be implemented in the 0.8 series are:
\* updates of the logging system to rate-limit and more cleanly log
warnings
\* integration of FreeBSD support
\* implement better filtering of information passed between NSS layer and
LDAP server (e.g. make user and group name filtering configurable with
regular expression)
\* investigate switching to using environment variables to disable NSS
module
\* implementation of nested groups

With this release the 0.7 series will be in bugfixes-only mode. It will
still receive bugfixes and security support for some time but not any
major new features.
This allows for some more elbow room to introduce some new features in
the 0.8 series. A few interesting features that may make it in are:
\* an experimental Python implementation of nslcd (a very rough
beginning is available)
\* perhaps integrate the FreeBSD code, maybe work on Solaris (Illumos)
support
\* nested groups
\* rootpwmodpw option (see mailing list archives)
\* more autodetection and SASL configuration of the Debian package
\* implement other services in nslcd: sudo and autofs are candidates
\* perhaps rework PAM nslcd protocol to have cleaner support for
currently used functionality
\* have a logging framework to more clearly log invalid entries without
flooding the logs
If you are interested in any of these features or have some important
ones to add please drop a note on the nss-pam-ldapd-users mailing list.
Any input and ideas are appreciated, patches even more so. Also, if you
are willing to work on any improvements just drop by on the mailing

Release 0.7.4 has just been made available which fixes some bugs and
includes some new functionality. This should be a reasonably stable and
well tested release.
A summary of the changes since 0.7.3:
\* fix a buffer overflow that should have no security consequences
\* perform proper fail-over when authenticating in the PAM module
\* add an nss\_initgroups\_ignoreusers option to ignore user name to group
lookups for the specified users
\* add an pam\_authz\_search option to perform a flexible authorisation
check on login (e.g. to restrict which users can login to which hosts,
etc)
\* implement a minimum\_uid option for the PAM module to ignore users that
have a lower numeric user id
\* change the way retries are done to error out quicker if the LDAP
server is down for some time (this should make the system more
responsive when the LDAP server is unavailable) and rename the
reconnect\_maxsleeptime option to reconnect\_retrytime to better
describe the behaviour
\* only log &quot;connected to LDAP server&quot; if the previous connection failed
\* documentation improvements
