| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=682332#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-03-04 21:13:44 UTC  ``` Drew Yao of Apple Product Security reported a flaw in how Ruby's BigDecimal implementation.  In a 64-bit program, if the amount of memory to allocate is greater than 2^32, the allocated amount will be truncated to a 32-bit unsigned integer, however the amount to memset will use the full 64-bit number, leading to a crash or memory corruption.  After the memset, the unexpectedly small buffer could be used in other ways that lead to memory corruption or, possibly, code execution.  This flaw only affects 64-bit processes.  To test whether or not ruby is vulnerable, the following can be used (on a vulnerable ruby it will cause a segfault):  $ ruby -e 'require "bigdecimal"; BigDecimal.new("8").**(0x20000000)'  Upstream committed the following to fix the flaw:  <http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/ext/bigdecimal/bigdecimal.c?r1=29364&r2=30993>   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=682332#c19)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-28 16:50:40 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Drew Yao of the Apple Product Security team for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=682332#c20)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-28 17:22:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4  Via RHSA-2011:0908 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0908.html>   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=682332#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-28 17:33:35 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0910 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0910.html>   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=682332#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-06-28 17:34:09 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2011:0909 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0909.html>   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=682332#c23)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-29 14:23:20 UTC  ``` Statement:  (none)   ``` |  |
