Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0447:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from Rails' inadequate validation of HTTP requests containing the `X-Requested-With` header. This header is often used in AJAX requests, and the lack of proper validation can be exploited to bypass CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF Protection Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability to bypass the built-in CSRF protection mechanism of Ruby on Rails.
*   **Insufficient HTTP Header Validation:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper validation of the `X-Requested-With` header in HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Attackers can craft malicious requests that appear to originate from a legitimate user, enabling them to perform actions on the victim's behalf without their knowledge or consent.
*   **Spoofed AJAX/API Requests:** Attackers can exploit this to send spoofed AJAX and API requests, potentially leading to unauthorized data modification, information disclosure, or other malicious actions.
*   **Session Reset:** After applying the patch, failed CSRF requests will result in the session being reset instead of generating HTTP 500 errors. This can disrupt the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Browser Plugins & HTTP Redirects:** Specific combinations of browser plugins and HTTP redirects can be manipulated to trick the user's browser into making cross-domain requests with attacker-specified headers.
*   **Maliciously Crafted HTTP Requests:** Attackers can create malicious requests including the `X-Requested-With` header to exploit the insufficient validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to induce user interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious site or clicking a malicious link that triggers the crafted HTTP request.
*   **Cross-domain request manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to send the crafted request from a different domain than the targeted web application.
*   **Understanding of vulnerable application:** The attacker needs to know how to craft HTTP requests targeting a vulnerable Ruby on Rails application.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Ruby on Rails versions 2.1.0 and above are affected.
*   **Fixed Versions:** Ruby on Rails versions 3.0.4 and 2.3.11 and later include the fix.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix requires changes to the application to ensure CSRF tokens are included in all non-GET requests. This may require modifications to JavaScript code to include CSRF tokens in AJAX requests.
*   **Patches:** Patches were provided for affected versions (2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 3.0 series).
*   **Workarounds:** No feasible workarounds were available.
*   **Impact of the fix:** The fix changes the behavior when CSRF protection fails, resetting the session instead of generating HTTP 500 errors. It also makes the token mandatory for all non-GET requests.
