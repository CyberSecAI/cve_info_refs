How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Potential XSS Problem with mail\_to :encode => :javascript

with the :encode => :javascript option. This vulnerability has been
assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2011-0446.

Versions Affected: All.
Not affected: Applications which don't use :encode => :javascript
Fixed Versions: 3.0.4, 2.3.11

Impact
------
An attacker could specify a malicious name or email value which could
enable an XSS attack. All users running an affected release should
either upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.

Releases
--------
The 3.0.4 and 2.3.11 releases are available at the normal locations.

Workarounds
-----------
The simplest work around is to specify :encode => :hex instead, for
example:

Before:
 <%= mail\_to user.email, [user.name](http://user.name), :encode => :javascript %>

After:
 <%= mail\_to user.email, [user.name](http://user.name), :encode => :hex %>

Those requiring the javascript encoding should escape the javascript
passed to both values.

Before:
 <%= mail\_to user.email, [user.name](http://user.name), :encode => :javascript %>

After:
 <%= mail\_to escape\_javascript(user.email),
escape\_javascript([user.name](http://user.name)), :encode => :javascript %>

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided a
patch for the supported release series. It is in git-am format and
consists of a single changeset.

\* 3-0-mailto.patch - Patch for 3.0 series
\* 2-3-mailto.patch - Patch for 2.3 series

Please note that only the 2.3.x and 3.0.x series are supported at
present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade
as soon as possible.

Credits
-------
Thanks to Brendan Coles of IT Security Solutions and Rick Olson of
Github reporting the vulnerability to us.

Package        : rails
Vulnerability  : several vulnerabilities
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0446 CVE-2011-0447
Debian Bug     : 614864

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-0446

    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when JavaScript
    encoding is used, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
    script or HTML.

CVE-2011-0447

    Rails does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an
    X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers
    to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny0.1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze0.1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.11-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
