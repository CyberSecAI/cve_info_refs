Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0446:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `mail_to` helper function within the Ruby on Rails framework, specifically when used with the `:encode => :javascript` option.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The `mail_to` helper with javascript encoding does not properly sanitize user-provided input for email addresses or names. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the generated links when the `:encode => :javascript` option is used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the victim's browser session.
- **Data Theft:** Attackers could steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- **Website Defacement:** Attackers could modify the content of the page displayed in the browser.
- **Phishing:** Attackers could redirect users to fake login pages to steal their credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker can provide a malicious email address or name via a parameter in the URL, a database entry, or any other means where user-controlled data is used in the mail\_to helper function with the `:encode => :javascript` option.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the `mail_to` helper generates the HTML link using the unsanitized input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to control or influence the data used by the `mail_to` helper function, specifically the "name" and "email" values.
- No specific position within the network or application is required. The attack is carried out via an XSS vector, therefore the attacker only needs to be able to inject the malicious data that is later interpreted by the user's browser.

**Additional details:**
- Versions affected: All versions of Rails when using the `:encode => :javascript` option.
- Fixed versions: 3.0.4, 2.3.11
- Workarounds include:
    - Use `:encode => :hex` instead
    - Escape the javascript passed to both name and email
