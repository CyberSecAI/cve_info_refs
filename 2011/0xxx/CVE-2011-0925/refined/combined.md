ZDI-11-092: (0day) Cisco Secure Desktop CSDWebInstaller ActiveX Control Cleaner.cab Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-092
February 23, 2011
-- CVE ID:
CVE-2011-0925
-- CVSS:
8.3, (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
-- Affected Vendors:
Cisco
-- Affected Products:
Cisco Secure Desktop
-- TippingPoint(TM) IPS Customer Protection:
TippingPoint IPS customers have been protected against this
vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID 8247.
For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS, visit:
http://www.tippingpoint.com
-- Vulnerability Details:
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on
vulnerable installations of Cisco Secure Desktop. User interaction is
required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within CSDWebInstaller.ocx. The
CSDWebInstallerCtrl ActiveX control allows downloading and executing any
Cisco-signed executable files. By renaming a Cisco-signed executable
file to inst.exe and putting it on a webserver, an attacker can
subsequently exploit vulnerabilities in the Cisco-signed executable file
remotely.
-- Vendor Response:
February 23, 2011 - This vulnerability is being disclosed publicly without a patch in accordance with the ZDI 180 day
deadline.
-- Mitigations:
Cisco states that they will have a patch for this issue on March 31st, 2011. In the meantime, we suggest users implement the mitigations below.
The killbit can be set on this control to disable scripting within Internet Explorer by modifying the data value of the Compatibilty Flags DWORD within the following location in the registry:
HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\ActiveX Compatibility\705EC6D4-B138-4079-A307-EF13E4889A82
If the Compatibility Flags value is set to 0x00000400 the control can no longer be instantiated inside the browser. For more information, please see: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/240797
-- Disclosure Timeline:
2010-08-25 - Vulnerability reported to vendor
2011-02-23 - Coordinated public release of advisory

-- About the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI):
Established by TippingPoint, The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) represents
a best-of-breed model for rewarding security researchers for responsibly
disclosing discovered vulnerabilities.
Researchers interested in getting paid for their security research
through the ZDI can find more information and sign-up at:

The ZDI is unique in how the acquired vulnerability information is
used. TippingPoint does not re-sell the vulnerability details or any
exploit code. Instead, upon notifying the affected product vendor,
TippingPoint provides its customers with zero day protection through
its intrusion prevention technology. Explicit details regarding the
specifics of the vulnerability are not exposed to any parties until
an official vendor patch is publicly available. Furthermore, with the
altruistic aim of helping to secure a broader user base, TippingPoint
provides this vulnerability information confidentially to security
vendors (including competitors) who have a vulnerability protection or
mitigation product.
