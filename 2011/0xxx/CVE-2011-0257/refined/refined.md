Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-0257:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime's handling of PICT files. Specifically, it occurs during the processing of the `PnSize` opcode within a PICT file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** QuickTime improperly handles the `PnSize` opcode, converting an unsigned 16-bit value to a signed 32-bit value, which is then used as the size parameter for a memory copy operation. This allows an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running QuickTime. This could lead to a full compromise of the system.
- **Application Termination:** Exploitation can also cause an unexpected application termination of QuickTime.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious PICT File:** The primary attack vector involves a specially crafted PICT file containing a malicious `PnSize` value. This file could be delivered through various means, such as:
    - A website hosting the malicious file.
    - Email attachment.
    - Embedding the malicious file within other documents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the target and can be remote.
-   **User Interaction:** The target user must either open the malicious PICT file or visit a website that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability affects QuickTime on Windows and Mac OS X v10.5.8, but it is addressed in Mac OS X v10.6.8 and does not affect OS X Lion (10.7) systems.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Matt "j00ru" Jurczyk and reported to Apple through the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
* Apple released QuickTime 7.7 to patch this and several other vulnerabilities.
* A Metasploit module exists for this vulnerability.
