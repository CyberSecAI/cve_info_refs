Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an insecure default configuration of the SNMP service in HP Discovery & Dependency Mapping Inventory (DDMI) when running on Windows. DDMI, by default, may install and configure the Windows SNMP service with the default security settings. This leads to the SNMP read community string being set to "public".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The primary weakness is that the SNMP service is configured with a well-known default read community string ("public").
- **Lack of Secure Community String:** Using "public" as the read community string allows unauthorized access to SNMP data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Read-Only Access:** Attackers can remotely gain read-only access to data available via the SNMP protocol. This could potentially expose sensitive information about the system and network.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending SNMP requests to the target system.
- **SNMP Protocol:** The attack vector is through the SNMP protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the system running the vulnerable DDMI software.
- **SNMP Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the SNMP protocol to craft and send appropriate requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided security bulletin indicates the CVSS v2 base score as 4.9 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P), which signifies a moderate severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists in HP Discovery & Dependency Mapping Inventory (DDMI) running on Windows versions v7.50, v7.51, v7.60, v7.61, v7.70 and v9.30.
- The resolution involves changing the SNMP read community string from the default "public" to a more secure value. This should be done via the Windows Services Control Panel.
- The vulnerability allows read-only access meaning it does not allow for configuration changes to the target.
