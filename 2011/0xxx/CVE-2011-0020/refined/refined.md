Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0020:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `pango_ft2_font_render_box_glyph()` function within `pango/pangoft2-render.c`, which is used when Pango renders fonts using FreeType2 as a backend.
*   The root cause is that the code allocates a buffer based on the bitmap dimensions of the glyph (`box->bitmap.rows * box->bitmap.pitch`) but then writes to this buffer using offsets derived from the glyph's width without validating that those offsets remain within the bounds of the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.  The code calculates a buffer size, then writes data beyond the allocated boundary. Specifically, the code writes 0xff to locations derived from the glyph width without verifying these offsets are within buffer limits, causing the overflow.
*   **Integer Overflow:** While not the primary trigger, the potential for integer overflow exists when calculating the buffer size (`box->bitmap.rows * box->bitmap.pitch`). A large enough `rows` or `pitch` could lead to a small allocation due to wrapping, potentially making the overflow easier to trigger.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Heap Corruption:** The out-of-bounds writes lead to corruption of the heap memory.
*   **Application Crash:** The heap corruption can result in the affected application crashing (demonstrated by the `pango-view` crash in the provided test case).
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** It's noted that such a heap corruption can "potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application" however this is not confirmed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malformed Font Files:** An attacker needs to create or modify a font file such that the bitmap dimensions of a glyph and its overall width would cause the overflow in the vulnerable function.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to load this crafted font file in an application that uses Pango with the FreeType2 backend for rendering. This could be achieved by opening a document or webpage which loads the malicious font or setting the malicious font as the default font for the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Font Crafting:** The attacker must be able to craft a font that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attacker needs to get a user to load the crafted font file via an application that uses the vulnerable Pango and FreeType2 backend.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in `pango_ft2_font_render_box_glyph()` in `pango/pangoft2-render.c`.
*   The vulnerable code was used by older versions of applications like GIMP and possibly Inkscape, but it was not typically used in GTK+ rendering or Firefox.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by correctly calculating the offsets when writing the buffer to stay within the allocated buffer size.
*   The fix also included integer overflow protection for the g_malloc0 call
*   CVE-2011-0064 is a related vulnerability that was addressed in the same fix.
