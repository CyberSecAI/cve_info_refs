Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the `Array.FastCopy` function in the Mono runtime environment. This function was used for fast array copying, but lacked proper synchronization or locking mechanisms, leading to the race condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** Multiple threads could access and modify the array's metadata (specifically, element types) concurrently while `Array.FastCopy` was in progress.
*   **Type Confusion:** The race condition allowed the type of an array element to be changed during the fast copy operation. This could involve changing the element to a privileged read-only element.
*   **Sandboxing Violation:**  The ability to modify array elements in this way could lead to a bypass of the security sandbox implemented in Moonlight (the Mono Silverlight equivalent), a sandboxing violation, or a break out.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sandbox Escape:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to break out of the Moonlight sandbox environment, thus executing code outside the intended security constraints.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By modifying array elements to privileged ones, attackers could potentially elevate their privileges or gain access to restricted functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Silverlight application:**  A specially crafted Silverlight application loaded within a Moonlight runtime could trigger the vulnerable `Array.FastCopy` operation in a multi-threaded manner, exploiting the race condition to achieve a sandbox escape.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to run code within Moonlight:** The attacker would need to have the ability to execute code within the Moonlight environment, typically by tricking the user into loading a malicious application.
*   **Understanding of Mono internals:** Exploiting this vulnerability likely requires knowledge of how `Array.FastCopy` works and how to manipulate type information in the Mono environment.
