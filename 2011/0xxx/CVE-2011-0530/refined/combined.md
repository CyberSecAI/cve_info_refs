Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3
- aaa\_base
shell meta characters in file names could cause interactive shells
to execute arbitrary commands when performing tab expansion
(CVE-2011-0468).
Affected Products: openSUSE 11.3, 11.4
- flash-player
The Adobe Flash Player was updated to version 10.2.153.1 to fix a
buffer overflow. Attackers could potentially exploit that to execute
arbitrary code (CVE-2011-0609).
Affected Products: SLE10-SP3, SLE11-SP1, openSUSE 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
- pango
Specially crafted font files could cause a heap corruption in

3) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file containing the announcement.
The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can

command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and integrity of a
package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered with.
The internal RPM package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on RPMv4-based
distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during installation. You can
also find it on the first installation CD and included at the end of this
announcement.

[4] <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nbd/files/nbd/2.9.0/>

contains the issue again. This flaw was fixed second time via upstream changeset:
[5] <https://github.com/yoe/nbd/commit/3ef52043861ab16352d49af89e048ba6339d6df8>

References:
[6] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=611187>
[7] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=673562>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thanks && Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Subject: nbd-server dies due to EFAULT from read
Date: Wed, 26 Jan 2011 14:48:50 +0000
```
Package: nbd-server
Version: 1:2.9.11-3

In an automatic test system (used by xen upstream) I encountered this
failure:

 Jan 25 16:12:36 leaf-beetle nbd_server[20034]: Read failed: Bad address
 Jan 25 16:12:36 leaf-beetle nbd_server[20033]: Child exited with 1

The client naturally then saw a series of IO failures and was
generally very unhappy.

The problem is not easily reproducible.  I have seen similar failures
before but they are very infrequent.

The configuration in this case was:

 * Two NBDs: each one of an LVM volume on the server imported by the client
 * Each LVM VG backed by a single PV on a physical disk partition
 * Both hosts' hardware: rackservers.com AMD-based server
 * Both hosts' userland: amd64 lenny userland
 * Both hosts' kernel: Xen-enabled xen.org kernel derived from 2.6.32.27
 * Both hosts' hypervisor: xen-unstable 4.1.0 RC2+
 * nbd server hostname: leaf-beetle
 * nbd client hostname: potato-beetle

Full logs can be found here for the next few weeks:
  <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~xensrcts/logs/5238/test-amd64-amd64-pair/info.html>

I appreciate that this isn't very much to go on.  If you would like to
suggest some additional instrumentation, or additional logs to
capture, I will be happy to add that to my test machinery and then
report the results as and when the bug recurs.

Thanks,
Ian.

Here is a copy of the /etc/nbd-server/config from the server:

# generated by ./ts-guests-nbd-mirror

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : nbd
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0530

It was discovered a regression of a buffer overflow (CVE-2005-3534) in nbd,
the Network Block Device server, that could allow arbitrary code execution
on the NBD server via a large request.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.9.11-3lenny1.

The stable distribution (squeeze), the testing distribution (wheezy),
and the unstable distribution (sid) are not affected. This problem was
fixed prior the release of squeeze in version 1:2.9.16-8.

We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Yes, this means we've re-introduced [CVE-2005-3534](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-96w8-f5p6-mqmw "CVE-2005-3534"). Sigh.
