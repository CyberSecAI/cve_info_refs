| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=672250#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-01-24 15:35:48 UTC  ``` It was found that Request Tracker, a ticket tracking and management system, stored user passwords in its database by using insufficiently secure hashing algorithm. A local attacker, able to gain read access to the RT's database could use this flaw to conduct brute force password guessing attacks, potentially leading to disclosure of users' passwords.

It looks like there are some manual steps that need to be taken for both upgrades, but I'm not sure about "reformatting the database" (I'm also unsure what that means).  Looking at the UPGRADING-3.8 file (<https://github.com/bestpractical/rt/blob/master/docs/UPGRADING-3.8>) it does seem that there needs to be some changes done to fix the vulnerable password hashes.  I suspect you need to log into the database, so I'm not sure if you can run the password fixing script in %post automatically; you may need to alert users that the changes to the db need to be done manually (although I don't know if it's _mandatory_ in order to run; it's possible the new version will run with the old hashes but simply will be as insecure as the old versions until the user upgrades -- that would require some testing I suspect or asking upstream).  I would think that the code changes are to make use of the new hashes, not necessarily reject the old ones (but again, I don't use rt3 so have no idea).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=672250#c7)  Fedora Update System    2011-10-27 19:06:01 UTC  ``` rt3-3.6.11-2.el5 has been pushed to the Fedora EPEL 5 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |

Package        : request-tracker3.6
Vulnerability  : unsalted password hashing
Problem type   : local
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0009

It was discovered that Request Tracker, an issue tracking system,
stored passwords in its database by using an insufficiently strong
hashing method. If an attacker would have access to the password
database, he could decode the passwords stored in it.

For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.7-5+lenny5.

The testing distribution (squeeze) will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.8-7 of the request-tracker3.8 package.

We recommend that you upgrade your Request Tracker packages.

# [Rt-announce] Security vulnerability in RT 3.0 and up

```
All released versions of RT from 3.0.0 through 3.8.9rc1 use an
insecure hashing algorithm to store user passwords. If an attacker is
able to gain read access to RT's database, it would be possible for
the attacker to brute-force the hash and discover users' passwords.
CVE-2011-0009 has been assigned to this vulnerability.

This vulnerability may affect you even if your RT instance
authenticates against an external source. If your RT instance has ever
stored user passwords in the database, their presence is a risk.

For releases prior to RT 3.8.9, we've built an extension called
RT::Extension::SaltedPasswords to mitigate this.  This extension
alters RT's functionality to use salted SHA-256 to store passwords
instead of RT's current default.  It also includes a tool to detect
and upgrade all existing MD5 passwords to the new SHA-256 storage
format.  We've tested this extension with recent releases of RT 3.6
and RT 3.8.

You can download this extension from:
<http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/RT-Extension-SaltedPasswords-1.1.tar.gz>
<http://download.bestpractical.com/pub/rt/release/RT-Extension-SaltedPasswords-1.1.tar.gz.asc>

sha1sums:
686882212e757d18c10455a0051c1f3fed0b0d9d  RT-Extension-SaltedPasswords-1.1.tar.gz
b95e3c3089fb27cf730be01bcf29dc57ecd3a32b  RT-Extension-SaltedPasswords-1.1.tar.gz.asc

RT 3.8.9rc2 and 4.0.0rc4, to be released today, also close this
vulnerability by moving to a password storage based on salted SHA
hashes.  The former uses SHA-256 with a four-byte salt, identical to
what the above extension provides; the latter extends the size of the
password field and uses SHA-512 with a 16-byte salt.  We are
additionally considering moving RT 4.0 to the same multiple-round
SHA-512 algorithm that modern Linux crypt() uses.

We wish to thank Chris Ball <[cjb at laptop.org](http://lists.bestpractical.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/rt-announce)> for bringing this to our
attention in a diligent and professional manner.
