Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0009:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Request Tracker (RT) ticket tracking system used an insecure hashing algorithm (MD5) to store user passwords in its database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure hashing:** The use of MD5 without salting makes passwords vulnerable to brute-force attacks and rainbow table lookups if an attacker gains access to the database.
- **Lack of salting:** The absence of a unique salt for each password hash further weakens the security by allowing the same hash for the same password across different users, making pre-computed attacks much more effective.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Password disclosure:** A local attacker who obtains read access to the RT database could potentially recover user passwords by brute-forcing or using precomputed tables for MD5 hashes.
- **Compromised user accounts:** Successful password recovery could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the sensitive data within the ticket tracking system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local access:** An attacker requires local read access to the RT database to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Database access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to directly query or read the RT database containing password hashes. This could be achieved by compromising the database server, the RT server, or gaining unauthorized access through vulnerable system configurations.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects all RT versions from 3.0.0 to 3.8.9rc1, and possibly earlier versions.
- Best Practical, the developers of RT, provided a mitigation extension called `RT::Extension::SaltedPasswords` for releases before 3.8.9. This extension implements salted SHA-256 for password storage and allows for the upgrading of existing MD5 passwords.
- RT versions 3.8.9rc2 and 4.0.0rc4 and later versions use salted SHA hashes (SHA-256 and SHA-512 respectively) which resolves this vulnerability.
- Debian security advisory DSA-2150-1 addresses this vulnerability in Debian's `request-tracker3.6` package.
- Red Hat bug 672250 also tracks this issue.
