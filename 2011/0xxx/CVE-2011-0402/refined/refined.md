{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The dpkg-source component of dpkg did not correctly handle paths and symlinks when unpacking source-format version 3.0 packages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Improper handling of symlinks"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of service or potentially gaining access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted source package",
      "Tricking a user or automated system into unpacking the malicious package"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious source package that exploits the path and symlink handling vulnerabilities in dpkg-source. The attacker also needs to trick a user or an automated system into unpacking the malicious package.",
	"additional_information": "The vulnerability affects source packages using the \"3.0 quilt\" format at unpack-time."
