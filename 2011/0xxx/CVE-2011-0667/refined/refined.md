Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2011-0667:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by the improper management of kernel-mode driver objects within the Windows kernel (specifically, `win32k.sys`). This is a "use-after-free" vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:**  The core issue is that kernel-mode drivers are not correctly managing the lifecycle of kernel-mode objects. This leads to a situation where a driver attempts to use an object after it has been freed, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **System Compromise:** With kernel-mode access, an attacker can gain complete control of the affected system.
*   **Malicious Activities:** This includes the ability to install programs, view, modify, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker must be able to log on to the system locally. This means they need valid user credentials.
*   **Specially Crafted Application:**  The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted application that can trigger the use-after-free condition.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid Logon Credentials:** The attacker must have valid user credentials for a local account on the target system.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to log in to the target system directly, meaning remote exploitation is not possible.
*   **Ability to Run Code:** The attacker must be able to execute a malicious application on the target system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This CVE is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034.
*   The vulnerability resides within the `win32k.sys` driver, which is a core component of the Windows graphics subsystem.
*   The provided document also describes other vulnerabilities fixed in the same patch: "Win32k Null Pointer De-reference Vulnerability", which is caused by improper management of pointers to kernel-mode objects.

In summary, CVE-2011-0667 is a critical vulnerability that allows local attackers to elevate their privileges to the kernel level and gain full control of a vulnerable Windows system via a use-after-free condition in the `win32k.sys` driver.
