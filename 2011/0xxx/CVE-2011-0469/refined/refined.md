Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0469:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from improper argument handling in the `lxc` command execution within the openSUSE Build Service. Specifically, the `call-service-in-lxc.sh` script was vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of arguments passed to it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The script constructed shell commands by concatenating strings, which included user-controlled input. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting malicious input, which would be executed within the LXC container.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The script failed to properly sanitize or escape user-provided arguments before using them in shell commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker could achieve remote code execution on the build systems with the privileges of the `nobody` user inside the LXC container.
- **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation would lead to the compromise of the build system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector was through a malicious service definition added to a project. The service definition could include parameters that would be passed to the vulnerable script.
- Specifically, the parameters in the `download_url`, `tar_scm`, `download_src_package`, `update_source`, and `download_files` services were susceptible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker would need to be a user with the ability to create and modify project service definitions within the openSUSE Build Service.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** An understanding of the command injection vulnerability in the LXC wrapper script and how to exploit it by crafting malicious service definitions would be required.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability was present when using the "experimental LXC wrapper for additional security"
- The initial fix is in commit `76b0ab003f34435ca90d943e02dd22279cdeec2a` which addresses the argument handling issue in the `call-service-in-lxc.sh` script.
- A secondary fix in commit `23c8d21c75242999e29379e6ca8418a14c8725c6` verifies file names returned by the source service to avoid issues with files containing new lines.
- The bug report includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability via crafted service definitions.
- The `call-service-in-lxc.sh` script was modified to prevent the command injection.
- The fix includes sanitization/escaping of input parameters before using them in shell commands, and also an additional fix to verify the file names returned by the service.
