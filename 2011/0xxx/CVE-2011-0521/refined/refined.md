Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a negative array offset within the `av7110` driver of the Linux kernel. This was pointed out by Tavis Ormandy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Negative Array Offset:** The core issue is that the code allows for an array access using a negative index, which can lead to out-of-bounds memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exploitable:** The vulnerability is described as "exploitable" if the system has the affected hardware.
*   **Memory Corruption/Crash:** Negative array offsets can cause memory corruption or crashes, potentially leading to denial-of-service or even more severe consequences depending on the context.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attacker likely needs to have some level of access to the system to trigger the vulnerability through interaction with the `av7110` driver. It is likely local, as it is associated with a hardware driver and would require the presence of specific hardware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **System with Vulnerable Hardware:** The primary requirement is a system that uses the affected hardware and has the vulnerable `av7110` driver loaded in the kernel.
*   **Ability to Interact with Driver:** The attacker must have some way of triggering the vulnerable code path within the driver by sending specific commands or data to it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in kernel version 2.6.38 (based on the git commit referenced).
*   VMware also addressed this vulnerability in their ESX and ESXi products.
*   The vulnerability was present in the Linux kernel driver, and potentially other implementations of the same driver.
