Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0778:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper restrictions on drag and drop operations within Google Chrome and WebKit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient input validation:** The browser does not adequately validate the origin or target of drag and drop operations.
*   **Same Origin Policy bypass:** The improper restrictions potentially allow attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy, a fundamental security mechanism in web browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Same Origin Policy bypass:** Successful exploitation could allow a malicious website to access resources or data from a different origin that it wouldn't normally be able to reach.
*   **Unspecified other impact**: The Debian security advisory notes the possibility of "unspecified vectors", which hints that other types of attacks might be possible through the drag and drop bypass.
*   The SUSE security report mentions "CVSS v2 Base Score: 3.7 (AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P)" for this vulnerability, indicating potential impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, but it also mentions "Local Access" and "High complexity" for exploiting it.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drag and drop operations:** An attacker could craft a malicious website or HTML content that exploits the browser's drag and drop handling. The specific vector is unspecified, meaning it could involve various manipulation of the drag and drop behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote attacker**: An attacker can be remote by hosting a malicious webpage.
*   **User Interaction**: The attack requires user interaction as the user would need to initiate the drag and drop action on the malicious webpage.
*   **Low Complexity, Local Access** The SUSE security report suggests the vulnerability has high complexity, and it could be exploited by local attacker only.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability was addressed in Google Chrome version 9.0.597.84.
*   The issue affects both Google Chrome and WebKit, with fixes applied in WebKit version 1.2.7.
* The vulnerability is also included in the SUSE security summary report.
* The CVE description "Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly restrict drag and drop operations, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via unspecified vectors" matches the extracted content and provides no further details.

**Summary**

CVE-2011-0778 describes a vulnerability in Google Chrome and WebKit related to improper handling of drag and drop operations. This lack of restrictions could allow an attacker to bypass the Same Origin Policy, with potential unspecified impacts, and requires the user to interact with a malicious webpage.
