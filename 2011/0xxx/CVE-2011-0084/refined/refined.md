Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `nsSVGGlyphFrame::GetCharNumAtPosition()` function, which is part of the SVG text manipulation routine in Mozilla Firefox.
- The code does not properly handle cases where user-defined getter methods modify or destroy the parent object while processing SVG text containers. Specifically, the `point->GetX(&xPos)` call can trigger a user-provided implementation of the 'x' property getter (from `nsIDOMSVGPoint`), which can remove the SVGTextElement nodes, and the associated frames which are still needed later during the traversal of the SVG container hierarchy, leading to a dangling pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Dangling pointer:** The primary vulnerability is a dangling pointer dereference. The code attempts to access memory that has been freed, because user-defined getter methods can free the object which contains the pointer.
- **Lack of proper input validation/sanitization:** The code doesn't sufficiently validate or sanitize the input from user-defined getter methods.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most critical impact is the potential for remote code execution. By exploiting the dangling pointer vulnerability, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the browser, potentially taking control of the user's system.
- **Crash:** If exploitation is not successful, the dangling pointer will cause the browser to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious web page:** An attacker can create a malicious web page containing specially crafted SVG content that exploits the vulnerability. When a user visits this page, the vulnerability is triggered.
- **Malicious SVG file:** A malicious SVG file could be crafted and opened in the browser leading to the vulnerability being triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, as the vulnerability is triggered by loading malicious content (either through a web page or opening an SVG file).
- **User interaction:** User interaction is required, in that the user must either visit a malicious web page, or open a malicious file.
- **Knowledge of SVG and DOM manipulation:** The attacker needs a good understanding of SVG and DOM manipulation to craft the exploit correctly.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by "regenrecht" via TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox 3.6.x and earlier, as well as other Mozilla-based products that use the same SVG rendering code.
- Patches were created for both the 1.9.1 and 1.9.2 release branches, as well as the 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 and trunk versions of Firefox.
- The fix involves ensuring that the `GetCharNumAtPosition` function only uses valid, native SVG points and doesn't rely on potentially malicious user-provided getter methods.
