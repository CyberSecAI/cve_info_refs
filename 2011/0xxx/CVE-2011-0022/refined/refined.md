Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0022:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions set on the `/var/run/dirsrv` directory by the 389 Directory Server (also known as Red Hat Directory Server) setup scripts. This directory is used to store PID (Process ID) files for multiple Directory Server instances configured to run under different unprivileged users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Permissions:** The setup scripts were setting permissions to `0777` on the `/var/run/dirsrv` directory. These permissions allow any user on the system to read, write, and execute within this directory.
- **PID File Manipulation:** Because the directory permissions are too open, a local, unprivileged user can create, remove or replace PID files in this directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:**  A local user can prevent the correct start of Directory Server instances by manipulating or removing the PID files.
- **Arbitrary Process Termination:** A malicious user could cause the Directory Server init script to kill arbitrary processes during the Directory Server shutdown, by replacing the pid files with the pid of another running process.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** This vulnerability can be exploited by any local user with access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system running the vulnerable Directory Server instances.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Directory Server 8 for RHEL 4 and RHEL 5 via RHSA-2011:0293.
