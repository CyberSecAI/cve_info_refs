Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a lack of sanitization of the `username` parameter in POST requests to the `forget.php` script of Symantec Web Gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The unsanitized `username` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL Injection:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code, which could lead to:
    *   Data theft/disclosure from the database.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Potential compromise of the server if the underlying database is exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `forget.php` script, manipulating the `username` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `forget.php` script on the Symantec Web Gateway appliance.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No prior authentication or user credentials are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected by filter ID '11365'.
*   Symantec has released an update to address this vulnerability.
