  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows OpenType Compact Font Format (CFF) driver does not properly validate the parameter values of specially crafted OpenType fonts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Stack overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or gain unauthorized access to your files or system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web-based attack: An attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability, or compromised Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability.",
       "Network share: An attacker could host a specially crafted OpenType font on a network share, and when a user navigates to the share in Windows Explorer, the affected control path is triggered via the Details and Preview panes.",
       "Local application: An attacker could run a specially crafted application to exploit the vulnerability"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would have to convince users to visit a website or network share containing the malicious font or to run a specially crafted application."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "workarounds": [
      "Disable the Preview Pane and Details Pane in Windows Explorer, which prevents the automatic display of OTF fonts in Windows Explorer.",
        "Disable the WebClient service, which helps protect systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service."
    ],
      "third_party_browsers": "Third-party Web browsers are affected by this vulnerability if they natively render OpenType fonts. For these applications, this vulnerability may allow remote code execution in the context of the logged on user if used to view a Web site with an embedded, specially crafted OpenType font."
