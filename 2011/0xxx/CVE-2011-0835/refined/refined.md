Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2011-0835:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Core RDBMS component of the Oracle Database.
- It is related to how the database handles session creation via the Oracle NET protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the session creation process.
- It can be exploited through the Oracle NET protocol.
- The vulnerability is classified as having a 'Low' Access Complexity.
- Successful exploitation requires the attacker to have the ability to initiate a 'create session' operation, which is a standard database operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can result in partial compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- The specific details of the impact are described as "Partial+" for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The plus (+) indicates that this is not a standard partial, it indicates that there is more impact that just a simple partial, without being complete. The impact can be more severe than partial, but less than complete.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is classified as "Network", meaning the vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- The attack utilizes the Oracle NET protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a database session on the target server, which is typically a publicly available network service.
- Authentication is not specifically mentioned, but creating a session usually means the ability to start the connection process with the server, possibly requiring the database credentials.

**Affected Versions:**
- Oracle Database 11*g* Release 1, version 11.1.0.7
- Oracle Database 11*g* Release 2, versions 11.2.0.1, 11.2.0.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The CVE is rated as having a CVSS base score of 6.5.
- The provided document from Oracle mentions that multiple vulnerabilities are fixed in the July 2011 CPU, and that prior CPU advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security fixes.
