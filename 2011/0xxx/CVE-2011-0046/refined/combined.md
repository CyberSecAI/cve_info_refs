## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

# 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, and and 4.0rc1 Security Advisory

Monday, Jan 24th, 2011
```

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* A weakness in Bugzilla could allow a user to gain unauthorized access
  to another Bugzilla account.

* A weakness in the Perl CGI.pm module allows injecting HTTP headers
  and content to users via several pages in Bugzilla.

* The new user autocomplete functionality in Bugzilla 4.0 is vulnerable
  to a cross-site scripting attack.

* The new automatic duplicate detection functionality in Bugzilla 4.0
  is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting attack.

* If you put a harmful "javascript:" or "data:" URL into Bugzilla's
  "URL" field, then there are multiple situations in which Bugzilla
  will unintentionally make that link clickable.

* Various pages lack protection against cross-site request forgeries.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Account Compromise
Affected:    2.14 to 3.2.9, 3.4.9, 3.6.3, 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
             any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
             enough that the attack is highly effective). This is a
             critical vulnerability that should be patched immediately
             by all Bugzilla installations.

             https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619594
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4568

Class:       HTTP Response Splitting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
             possible to inject both headers and content to any
             browser.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2761, CVE-2010-4411, CVE-2010-4572

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new client-side
             autocomplete mechanism for all fields where a username
             is entered. This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site
             scripting attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619637
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4569

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    3.7.1 to 4.0rc1
Fixed In:    4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla 3.7.x and 4.0rc1 have a new mechanism on the
             bug entry page for automatically detecting if the bug
             you are filing is a duplicate of another existing bug.
             This mechanism was vulnerable to a cross-site scripting
             attack.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619648
CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4570

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
             of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
             it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
             clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
             attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
             protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
             Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
             "data:" links were *always- summary: |-
             shown as clickable to
             logged-out users.
References:  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=619588

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Affected:    Every Version Before 3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Fixed In:    3.2.10, 3.4.10, 3.6.4, 4.0rc2
Description: Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
             Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
             as previous CSRF vulnerabilities. Some of these issues
             were only addressed on more recent branches of Bugzilla
             and not fixed in earlier branches, in order to avoid
             changing behavior that external applications may depend
             on. The links below in "References" describe which issues
             were fixed on which branches.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

sanitycheck.cgi has no CSRF protection. Should display an intermediary page asking the user if he/she wants to sanity check (including a token). Command-line shouldn't require the token.

Sanity checking modifies the database and can do a wide number of things that can cause Bugzilla to slow way down while tables are locked. So, yes, there is at least DoS danger here if not actual unwanted modification of data.

> Sanity checking modifies the database
No, just running a sanity check by itself doesn't modify the database (except perhaps in harmless ways that I'm forgetting about).
There are links on the page that change the database, but I'm pretty sure you can't do anything dangerous with them.

Well, it's easy enough to just close the page, in most circumstances. (I do understand you're talking about opening it in multiple iframes here.)
If we're concerned about DoS, there's probably some other solution for that that isn't related to CSRF. It's probably also not something we're going to fix any time soon.
Also remember that Bugzilla doesn't lock tables anymore, there are only row locks from the transactions, in some circumstances.

I agree that this is not a bug. No harm to the DB can be done, even when triggering one of the links included in the page. [ws:critical] doesn't make any sense at all. About DoS, you can already do that with queries if you really want to. So the bug as is is invalid/wontfix.Group: bugzilla-securityStatus: NEW â†’ RESOLVEDClosed: 14 years agoResolution: --- â†’ WONTFIXTarget Milestone: Bugzilla 3.2 â†’ ---

It's still a bug, as I have no wish for random people to cause my client to invoke sanity check without my permission, ESPECIALLY when many sanitycheck options modify the DB itself. sanitycheck is obviously restricted to editcomponents and higher for a reason. If it was perfectly safe, you wouldn't be protecting it.
Also, if there's a problem with groups/products, I'm fairly sure sanitycheck will give away product names even if strict\_isolation is on.Status: RESOLVED â†’ REOPENEDResolution: WONTFIX â†’ ---

The links on that page that go do things are exactly the problem. Some of them do dangerous things or resource-intensive things, and right now there's nothing stopping someone from tricking you to going to one of those links directly, without hitting sanitycheck itself on the way there.Group: bugzilla-security

That's fine, that doesn't expose that data to any external entity, only to you, yourself.
(In reply to [comment #7](/show_bug.cgi?id=621107#c7 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Sanity checking lacks CSRF protection"))
> Some of them do dangerous things or resource-intensive things
I don't think that there are any that do dangerous things. If it's humanly possible for sanitycheck to be dangerous, we should just fix that.
As far as being resource-intensive, I agree with LpSolit that you could just DoS Bugzilla in several other ways instead--by doing large queries, etc.
My suggestion is that we remove the security flag from this bug and untarget it.Severity: normal â†’ minor

I disagree. Why not just fix the problem instead of sending this bug to a blackhole?

Because it's very low-priority, there are very few of us, and we have a ton of work to do. Our efforts would be better spent on doing what is important instead of backporting unimportant changes to older branches.

Always require a token, even if no parameter is passed to the script. This means that you no longer can call <http://bugzilla.foo.com/sanitycheck.cgi> directly. If that's a problem, I can change my patch so that it only requires a token when a parameter is passed.

This patch isn't that complicated. Is there something that causes it to be more complicated on the branches, will something major be broken by it, or are we just looking for excuses to have fewer security bugs?

There are a lot of good reasons not to backport it:
\* More changes on stable security branches
\* Will very likely require backport work
\* I forget, but if we go back far enough we may need an entirely different patch.
\* Trying to break any existing links as little as possible on stable branches, with these CSRF patches.

Also, the only risk here that anybody has proven or demonstrated is a DoS, and we don't usually keep DoS bugs protected or backport them unless they have some sort of unusual severity (which this one does not).

LpSolit and I have discussed this, and we agree that:
\* This is not a security issue that needs to be kept confidential.
\* It would be best to just require tokens for the stuff that modifies the DB or does some action.Group: bugzilla-securityFlags: approval?Flags: approval4.0?Whiteboard: [infrasec:csrf][ws:critical] â†’ [infrasec:csrf]

Just to be clear (since a couple people asked me why mkanat and LpSolit were overriding me) I was in on this conversation as well, and he forgot to mention me. (gee, thanks)
But yes, after hashing through the various ways this could be exploited, we couldn't find a way to actually cause any damage. The worst thing it can cause is a DoS, and there's easier ways to DoS bugzilla than this that don't even require exploiting a CSRF to get at.
I still think we should fix it, I've just agreed that it doesn't need the whole security firedrill thing for it.

Bugzilla 4.0 still uses FILTER url\_quote instead of FILTER uri. That was the reason why the patch didn't apply cleanly on this branch.

                 CVE-2011-2381 CVE-2011-2978

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bugzilla, a web-based bug
tracking system.

CVE-2010-4572

  By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
  possible to inject both headers and content to any
  browser.

CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

  Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
  of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
  it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
  clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
  attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
  protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
  Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
  "data:" links were *always* shown as clickable to
  logged-out users.

CVE-2010-4568

  It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
  any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
  enough that the attack is highly effective).

CVE-2011-0046

  Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
  as previous CSRF vulnerabilities.

CVE-2011-2978

  When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts
  a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail
  address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker
  has access to the session of another user (for example,
  if that user left their browser window open in a public
  place), the attacker could alter this field to cause
  the email-change notification to go to their own address.
  This means that the user would not be notified that his
  account had its email address changed by the attacker.

CVE-2011-2381

  For flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline
  in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in
  email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.

CVE-2011-2379

  Bugzilla uses an alternate host for attachments when
  viewing them in raw format to prevent cross-site scripting
  attacks. This alternate host is now also used when viewing
  patches in "Raw Unified" mode because Internet Explorer 8
  and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,
  which could lead to the execution of malicious code.

CVE-2011-2380 CVE-201-2979

  Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible
  to members of the group, and to non-members if the group
  is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or
  editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed
  or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so
  which were supposed to remain confidential.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), it has not been practical to
backport patches to fix these bugs. Users of bugzilla on lenny are
strongly advised to upgrade to the version in the squeeze distribution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.2.0-4.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
the bugzilla packages have been removed.

We recommend that you upgrade your bugzilla packages.

Hi Mozilla people,
I found a new CSRF, this time on bugzilla.mozilla.org
It's easy, the remembered search is not protected and this could
be used to post "\*\*\*\*" on panels of legitimate users.
I've made a simple PoC/Exploit to trigger the vulnerability (it's attached)
Solution: Protect this request with a token as others
Regards,
Jose.

I would say that this is very very minor--there's no irreversible damage that can be caused, and no important data that can be exposed, just a minor annoyance.
We could probably use issue\_hash\_token here. I don't want to generate a DB token every time somebody does a search.Severity: normal â†’ minor

I agree that this is ultra minor. Personally, I don't qualify this bug as security-sensitive. As mkanat said, it's more a minor annoyance (which is easy to revert) than a security issue (no dataloss, no leak, no permanent change).
mkanat, agree to remove the security flag and retarget it to 4.0?

Unwanted modification of a user's data is still a security issue, even if it's just saved searches. I won't disagree that this is minor as compared to other issues, but it's still a security issue nonetheless, and it should be fixed.

I actually think that this should go into 4.2, since it might have an effect on Bugzilla clients that currently screen-scrape (the only way to currently deal with saved searches in an automated fashion) and I don't want to break them with no solution, this close to the 4.0 release.Target Milestone: Bugzilla 4.0 â†’ Bugzilla 4.2

There are other changes which will have more effects than this one, IMO, so taking it for 4.0 won't hurt, especially because we are still in the RC step.

I understand where you're coming from, but I don't think that you have enough experience writing clients or talking to the major writers of clients to really see how difficult you will be making their lives if you add this to 4.0 so close to its release time.
I also plan to prevent other major changes which will break significant client functionality on the 4.0 branch, if possible.

We should hold 4.0 until these issues are fixed. Security fixes shouldn't have to wait another year to get fixed when we have a patch today.

Security trumps compatibility, always. Put it in 4.0. Especially if you're going to break them anyway for 4.1. Better to break them before the final release if you're going to break it, than after then final release when the API is supposedly stable on the branch.

Dave, usually I don't disagree with you, but in this case, this is not a critical issue. This isn't about "security", it's about preventing petty vandalism that has never happened and wouldn't even be dangerous if it did happen. There's no information that could be exposed, there's nothing critical that could be permanently lost.
Also, we would be adding a CSRF token to a part of Bugzilla that:
(a) has no API
(b) is used by major clients
(c) has no method for clients to get the CSRF token
In other words, there would no longer be any way automated way to create, update, or delete saved searches in clients, other than actually running the entire search and then pulling the token out from the HTML. In most clients, this would mean running a search twice in some cases--once for the HTML results and once for the XML/CSV results.
The issue really is not critical--this bug isn't even hidden. I don't see any need for it to block 4.0, go into 4.0 at all, or to hinder clients for 4.0.

Huh? Hash tokens automatically hash the user ID, you don't have to pass it. So you cannot use your own token to impersonate someone else.

You already need a token to delete a saved search. Nothing new here.

They are time-bombed! And this is fine for a user to reuse the same token for himself for the next 3 days if he wants to, for non-critical actions. This would help the clients you are talking about to get a valid token, and reuse it for 3 days.

Oh, and you have no way to know the token used by that user anyway. Unless the user pasted you the whole source code of the page.

Ok I see what you are saying now. I was using an example from LpSolit's sanitycheck CSRF patch doing issue\_hash\_token(['sanitycheck']).
As LpSolit mentioned the user id and site wide secret are already added
to the hash. What if I used the actual query string as one of the args?

This is IMO not needed. On one side, mkanat complains this issue is REALLY not critical, but on the other side, he wants stronger randomness to generate the token...

Doesn't exist in the remember search form block in buglist.cgi and also is not used in 3.6 which I am backporting this to.

Yeah, I know that seems weird. Here's the thing though:
If it's not an issue, then we don't need to fix it.
If it is an issue, then we need to fix it right.
I don't want to do some in-between thing where we fix it but it's not really secure.

Actually, yes it does. It's generated by redirect\_search\_url, which is at the very top of buglist.cgi.

Okay. This bug isn't targeted there, though.

Define secure? You cannot steal someone else's token. I think it's fine to see two levels of security: one high level where a token should be valid only once, in case it's disclosed, and a low lever where a token can be valid a short amount of time and wouldn't cause large damage if disclosed.

Hmm, okay, I think you're right.

Per IRC discussion we agreed that we'd make the backported patches available for anyone that wants them, but not check them in on the branches on ones that you can't cause serious damage with, due to the potential of breaking third party apps that integrate with Bugzilla.Status: ASSIGNED â†’ RESOLVEDClosed: 14 years agoFlags: blocking4.0?Flags: blocking4.0-Flags: approval4.0?Flags: approval4.0-Resolution: --- â†’ FIXEDTarget Milestone: Bugzilla 4.0 â†’ Bugzilla 4.2

OK, so I'm going to change my mind on this. After some discussion with LpSolit (and a couple other people) it's evident that the only overriding reason NOT to take this on the 4.0 branch is the one given in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=621090#c13 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Adding saved searches lacks CSRF protection") about third-party client integration. The patch has been tested on 4.0 and is safe, and doesn't break anything other than the ability to submit without a token. So the only thing we hurt if we DO take it on 4.0 is third-party client integration.
Well, Bugzilla 4.0 hasn't actually been released yet. Nothing with regards to API is set in stone until we do. Especially something like this which has no official API and already requires using a non-supported method to accomplish programatically from an external client anyway. Until we have a real API for it, they'll have to live with compensating for different ways it's done in different versions, just like they have in our previous releases.
As I said in [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=621090#c11 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Adding saved searches lacks CSRF protection"), security (even only against petty vandalism) trumps over compatibility. \*ESPECIALLY\* when we haven't actually released yet. So the third-party clients need to learn a new trick in order to create a saved query for you. I bet that's not the only new thing they're going to have to do for 4.0-compatibility, and others of these recent CSRF bugs have broken things far more critical to those apps already that they're already going to have to compensate for, so why not let them deal with this one at the same time while they're already dealing with other similar changes for 4.0 and avoid the aggravation of them having to do it all over again for 4.2.Status: RESOLVED â†’ REOPENEDFlags: blocking4.0-Flags: blocking4.0+Flags: approval4.0-Flags: approval4.0+Resolution: FIXED â†’ ---

Yes, exactly what I said: you cannot do any harm. Quips are unimportant and have no interaction with other bits of the Bugzilla code.

I disagree with your assertion that you "cannot do any harm", and I think more than a few Bugzilla administrators would likewise disagree. Having the entire quips database deleted would definitely be harmful to Bugzilla users who actually use quips. Just because you don't use it doesn't mean it's not important to somebody else.

Because I'm not going to fill the DB with tokens when editing quips.

|  | |

chart.cgi only supports tokens for deleting charts. Should also protect against unwanted chart creation/modification.

| [Comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=621108#c1)â€¢ 14 years ago |
|  | |

On the creating charts side, this is pretty minor. You'd be informed that you created a chart, and you'd just go delete it before it ever had a chance to gather data.
I suppose doing a CSRF on somebody and editing their charts would be a more significant annoyance.Severity: normal â†’ minor

Attached patch

[patch for 3.2 - 3.4, v1](attachment.cgi?id=506149&action=diff) (obsolete)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=506149&action=edit)
â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=621108&attachment=506149)

It finally wasn't a minor conflict in chart.cgi. Bugzilla::Series objects in 3.4 and older have no ->id and ->name methods, and assertCanEdit() doesn't return a series object. This patch works for both 3.4 and 3.2.

I'm not sure it really needs it, does it? As attacks go, changing the columns on my buglists is hardly serious.

i'm not even sure I would qualify this a security bug. My vote to retarget this bug to 3.6.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Actually, for the reason I gave on IRC, it would still make sense to take this bug for 3.2 and 3.4.
<LpSolit> I use votes to keep an eye when I don't want to CC myself (when I don't care about comments)

 Okay. Whether or not we take this for those branches will depend on whether or not there are patches that have been tested and reviewed for them by Monday.

Also, whoever writes the patches is on the hook to help provide any newly-needed APIs for clients that break.

No, that's definitely not their job. You are just trying to discourage someone from writing these backports.

No, I'm encouraging people to take responsibility for what they are causing. I'm saying, "If you are going to this against my wishes, then I really don't want you to also be creating extra work for me that I am going to HAVE to do." I don't see why somebody else should have the right to cause me to have to do more work that \*I\* will ultimately be on the hook for--if somebody writes a patch that is going to cause other problems, then they are the person responsible for handling those problems, not me.

I'm going to approve this for branches for the same reasons I gave in [bug 621090 comment 36](/show_bug.cgi?id=621090#c36 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Adding saved searches lacks CSRF protection") (too lengthly to repeat here, and you can see that one publicly).
On the stability of compatibility with released branches I can probably be talked out of 3.6 and earlier, though I personally see no reason not to take it for those anyway, and am of the opinion that we should still take it on those, but this should definitely go into 4.0.

|  | |

 Sure, I had already approved this for 4.0 and 3.6 both. And this bug is indeed locked, so I agree it's a security issue.
Does the existing patch apply to 3.4 and 3.2? If this bug is retargeted to 3.2 and the existing patch does not apply, then this bug will miss the boat for the release unless it those patches are supplied. If this bug is not retargeted to 3.2, then I will assume we're only checking it back to 3.6 and release it accordingly.

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
