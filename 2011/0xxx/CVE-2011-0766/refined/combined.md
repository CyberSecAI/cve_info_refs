## Erlang/OTP SSH library uses a weak random number generator

#### Vulnerability Note VU#178990

Original Release Date: 2011-05-25 | Last Revised: 2011-05-25

---

### Overview

The Erlang/OTP SSH library's random number generator is not cryptographically strong because it relies on predictable seed material.

### Description

| Geoff Cant's report states:  *The Erlang/OTP ssh library implements a number of cryptographic operations that depend on cryptographically strong random numbers. Unfortunately the RNG used by the library is not cryptographically strong, and is further weakened by the use of predictable seed material. The RNG (Wichman-Hill) is not mixed with an entropy source.The seed used for all ssh connections in the library is the current time (to approximately microsecond resolution). By observing the time a connection from this library is established, the first two components of the three RNG seed can be guessed.The third component can be recovered by brute-force; trying each possible value (1..1000000).Guessing the exact seed is made easier by the 16 byte random session cookie that the library will send in its plaintext kexinit message. This cookie will be bytes 17-32 of the RNG sequence.**Once the session RNG seed is recovered, an attacker can simply perform the same DH key exchange operation as the SSH library and recover the session secret. Additionally, if the ssh library is used on the server side of the connection and DSA host key is used, the private key can be recovered from the kex\_dh messages. The secret signing value k is known from the RNG seed (bytes 170 - 190 of the sequence), so with the public DSA key data in the kex\_dh\_reply message the private part can be recovered by inverting the signature operation.* |

### Impact

| An attacker can recover SSH session keys and DSA host keys. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an Update**A [patch has been committed](https://github.com/erlang/otp/commit/f228601de45c5b53241b103af6616453c50885a5) for issue "ssh 2.0.5 OTP 9225" to the Erlang/OTP source that remediates the vulnerability. All SSH DSA keys used with the vulnerable library should be changed. Any password or secret sent over a connection that used the vulnerable library should be changed as well.[Erlang/OTP R14B03](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) is the first official release to address this vulnerability. Users that don't apply the patch should upgrade to R14B03 or later. |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
