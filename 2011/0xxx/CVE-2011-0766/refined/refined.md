{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Erlang/OTP SSH library's random number generator (RNG) relies on predictable seed material, specifically the current time, making it cryptographically weak.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a weak random number generator (Wichman-Hill).",
      "Predictable seed material (current time to microsecond resolution).",
      "Lack of entropy source mixing with the RNG."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can recover SSH session keys and, if DSA host keys are used on the server side, the private key can also be recovered.",
    "attack_vectors": "Observing the time a connection from the vulnerable library is established allows guessing of the first two components of the RNG seed. The third component can be brute-forced. The 16-byte session cookie sent in the plaintext kexinit message further aids in seed recovery.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to observe the time when a connection is established using the vulnerable library. They also need the ability to intercept and analyze the kexinit message from the SSH handshake to obtain the session cookie. For private key recovery, the attacker needs to be able to intercept and analyze the kex_dh_reply message from the vulnerable server side SSH connection using DSA host keys."
