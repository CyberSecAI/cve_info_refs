Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2011-0912:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how IBM Lotus Notes handles malformed strings within `cai://` URIs. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize input passed to the URI handler.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Input Validation: The application fails to properly validate or sanitize input within the `cai://` URI, allowing for the injection of malicious parameters.
- DLL Injection: The vulnerability allows the injection of the `--launcher.library` switch, which can be directed to load a malicious DLL from a network share.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation results in arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- Privilege Escalation: The code executes under the context of the current user, potentially leading to further access or control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URI: The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious `cai://` URI that contains the injected `--launcher.library` switch.
- User Interaction Required: The victim must interact with the malicious URI for the exploit to work (e.g., clicking a link).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver a malicious `cai://` URI to the victim. This could be done through methods like phishing emails, malicious web pages, or other means of communication.
- The attacker also needs to host the malicious DLL on a network share accessible to the victim machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to IBM in December 2009, and a coordinated public release of the advisory occurred in February 2011.
- The advisory mentions a link to an IBM support document with additional details ([http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21461514](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21461514)), which is not included in the provided content.
