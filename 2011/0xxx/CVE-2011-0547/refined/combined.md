# Advisory Details

## Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation vxsvc.exe ASCII String Unpacking Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-263ZDI-CAN-1112

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-0547](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0547) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Veritas Storage Foundation](http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/products/overview.jsp?pcid=1020&pvid=203_1) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11574']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation Administrator Service. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within vxsvc.exe. The problem affecting the part of the server running on TCP port 2148 is an integer overflow in the function vxveautil.value\_binary\_unpack during the handling of the ascii strings (opcode 6) where the 32-bit field supplied by the attacker is used for allocating a destination buffer by adding an additional byte to its value. This integer overflow can be used to create a small allocation which will be subsequently overflowed, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Symantec has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <http://www.symantec.com/business/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=2011&suid=20110815_00> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2011-02-17 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2011-08-16 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation vxsvc.exe Unicode String Parsing Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-262ZDI-CAN-1111

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-0547](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0547) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |

| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [Veritas Storage Foundation](http://www.symantec.com/enterprise/products/overview.jsp?pcid=1020&pvid=203_1) |
| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11573']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the vxsvc.exe process. The problem affecting the part of the server running on TCP port 2148 is an integer overflow in the function vxveautil.value\_binary\_unpack where a 32-bit field holds a value that, through some calculation, can be used to create a smaller heap buffer than required to hold user-supplied data. This can be leveraged to cause an overflow of the heap buffer, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM. |

## Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation vxsvc.exe Value Unpacking Integer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-264ZDI-CAN-1110

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-0547](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0547) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |

| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation Administrator Service. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within vxsvc.exe process. The problem affecting the part of the server running on tcp port 2148 is an integer overflow in the function vxveautil.kv\_binary\_unpack where a 32-bit field is used to allocate an amount of memory equal to its value plus 1. This can be made to miscalculate a heap buffer which can be subsequently overflowed allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of SYSTEM. |
