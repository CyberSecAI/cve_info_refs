The provided content contains three distinct vulnerabilities, all associated with CVE-2011-0547. Each vulnerability allows for remote code execution in Symantec Veritas Storage Foundation Administrator Service, specifically within the `vxsvc.exe` process, due to integer overflow issues in the `vxveautil` library. All vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable without authentication, leading to SYSTEM-level code execution.

Here's a breakdown of each vulnerability:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Integer overflow in `vxveautil.value_binary_unpack` during the handling of ASCII strings (opcode 6). A 32-bit field provided by the attacker is used to allocate a destination buffer by adding one byte to its value. This can cause a small allocation, leading to a subsequent heap overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted network request to the vulnerable service on TCP port 2148.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Integer overflow in `vxveautil.value_binary_unpack` during the handling of Unicode strings. A 32-bit field is used in a calculation that leads to allocating a smaller heap buffer than required, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to heap overflow.
*  **Impact:** Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted network request to the vulnerable service on TCP port 2148.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*  **Root cause:** Integer overflow in the `vxveautil.kv_binary_unpack` function. A 32-bit field is used to allocate an amount of memory by adding 1 to its value. This can be exploited to create a heap buffer smaller than needed, which will be overflowed.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow leading to heap overflow.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Attack vector:** Sending a crafted network request to the vulnerable service on TCP port 2148.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
