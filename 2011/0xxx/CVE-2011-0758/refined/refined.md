Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-0758

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the eTrust Common Services Transport (ECSQdmn.exe) service of CA eTrust Secure Content Manager.
- The service, running on port 1882, uses a user-supplied DWORD value in a memory copy operation.
- A lack of bounds checking allows an integer to be improperly calculated, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap overflow: The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow, where data is written beyond the allocated memory region.
- Lack of bounds checking: The software fails to validate the size of the user-supplied value before using it in the memory copy operation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.
- System Compromise: The attacker gains system-level privileges, achieving complete control over the compromised system.
- The exploit results in a remote system compromise with SYSTEM credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- Unauthenticated: No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, meaning an attacker can trigger the vulnerability without any prior access or credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable system on port 1882.
- No authentication: The attacker does not need any valid username or password, or any prior authentication, before they are able to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to CA on 2008-05-23.
- CA has issued a patch to correct this vulnerability.
- Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['6184'].
