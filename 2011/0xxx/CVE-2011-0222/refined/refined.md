Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-0222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from multiple memory corruption issues within WebKit. Specifically, it is triggered by how Safari processes SVG DOM elements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The primary issue is memory corruption due to flaws in WebKit's handling of SVG DOM elements, as indicated by various sources.
- **Heap buffer overflow:** Some of the included documents refer to heap buffer overflows which are a type of memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can also lead to a denial of service by causing the application to crash.
- **Application termination:** The vulnerabilities can result in unexpected termination of the application

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely through a crafted website.
- **Crafted SVG:** Attackers can use a maliciously crafted web page containing specific SVG elements to trigger the memory corruption.
- **Man-in-the-middle:** The iTunes document mentions a man-in-the-middle attack as a possible attack vector while browsing the iTunes store.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website that a user visits using a vulnerable version of Safari or another application using the vulnerable WebKit version.
- **Crafted Content:** The attacker needs to create a specifically crafted SVG file or web page to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming):** One exploit mentioned uses ROP to bypass DEP (Data Execution Prevention).
- **Affected Software:** This vulnerability affects WebKit and the applications that use it such as Safari and iTunes.
- **Versions Affected:** This impacts Safari versions prior to 5.0.6 and also appears in WebKit on iOS versions prior to iOS 5.

**Affected Products:**
- Safari
- iTunes
- iOS
- Applications using the vulnerable version of WebKit.
