Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0520:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow within the `compress_add_dlabel_points` function in `dns/Compress.c` of MaraDNS.
- The root cause is incorrect memory allocation size for storing dlabel pointers used during DNS name compression. The memory was allocated in bytes instead of `sizeof(int)` units, leading to a buffer that was too small.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `compress_add_dlabel_points` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption. This function is called when handling DNS queries that have a large number of labels.
- **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The code allocates a buffer of bytes instead of integers, making the buffer too small.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a server crash (segmentation fault) due to the buffer overflow. This makes the DNS server unavailable.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly confirmed, the CVE description and some sources mention the possibility of arbitrary code execution. However, the researcher notes that the data placed in the overwritten array (a list of increasing integers) can not be remotely controlled making it improbable to escalate privileges using this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by sending a specially crafted DNS query to the affected MaraDNS server.
- **Long DNS Hostnames:** The specific trigger is a DNS hostname with a large number of labels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable MaraDNS server.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, as it occurs in the context of processing standard DNS queries.

**Technical Details:**

- The `compress_add_dlabel_points` function adds the length to the `dlabel_points` array. A subsequent line `state->dlabel_points[counter + 1] = 0;` attempts to write beyond the allocated memory.
- The size of the `dlabel_points` array was defined by `MAX_DLABEL_POINTS`. The initial allocation used bytes rather than integers, which made the buffer too small and vulnerable to overflows, specifically because it would write `sizeof(int)` past the allocated buffer.
- The researcher found that the crash occurs when handling AAAA record queries, specifically when constructing NXDOMAIN responses.
- The vulnerability is triggered by queries containing a large number of labels in the hostname (e.g., names like "w.w.w.w.w.w....w.pl"), exceeding the intended buffer size.

**Additional Details:**
- The bug was present in MaraDNS versions 1.4.03, 1.4.05, and likely other versions.
- The vulnerability is related to a similar issue in MaraDNS reported in CVE-2002-2097, which also involved a bug in compression code.
- The fix involves allocating the buffer in units of `sizeof(int)` and reducing the `MAX_DLABEL_POINTS` to a more appropriate size.
- MaraDNS versions 1.4.06 and 1.3.07.11 have been released to address this issue.
