  And by 'we' you mean me, right? We all already code and answer support requests 7 days a week. Not sure if that would be effective use of my time.

  Same issue here - Vanilla Stats do not work on Safari under Mac OS X ![:(](https://open.vanillaforums.com/plugins/emojiextender/emoji/little/frown.png ":(") (Firefox is fine)

  I saw in the Safari Developer console that the following error is popping up:

  I'll have a look into this. Could have something to do with Safari's support for JSONp.

  i asked two times a pretty basic question ( jan. 18 and jan. 24) and no answer in any way, i mean a simple "we look into this, come back in a week or two or such" would have been nice since i know this is a free product and there is no free 12h nonstop super duper premium support, but i have never experienced anything like this... this is imho simply off the wall ![:D](https://open.vanillaforums.com/plugins/emojiextender/emoji/little/grin.png ":D")

  We don't post in every thread or answer every question. Anyone who uses this forum regularly knows that and 99% of those people seem to understand why.

  We sometimes have to ignore less pressing questions, or things that others in the community can and should answer, in favor of actually getting work done, or having meetings, or answering more urgent questions. That's a fact of life, and its not going to change anytime soon.

  Sometimes the thing you're asking about is not a priority for us right now and we cant dedicate time to supporting it. Or maybe you've posted about something that has been answered elsewhere already. Perhaps you're trying to use some plugin that is posted at version 0.1 and is provided with a disclaimer stating that it is an alpha version proof of concept and isn't meant to properly work yet. That could be why you were ignored.

  Bump for 2.0.17.6 - This is a SECURITY release that addresses 3 potential attack vectors:

  1) ?Target=\_\_\_\_\_\_ was vulnerable to phising attacks since it allowed users to forward others to remote websites without confirmation. This has been prevented.

  2) ?p=\_\_\_\_\_\_ was vulnerable to XSS attacks since it was inserted into the page without being sanitized.

  3) Cookie HMAC timing attacks. This allowed clever attackers to eventually spoof signed requests and potentially gain access to other accounts by signing fake cookies.

  Yes. I found a stupid date math problem in a key part of the code which caused stats to stop being sent. I've fixed the issue but I still need to put it together into a release, and figure out a smart way of allowing recovery of the last week's worth of stats.
