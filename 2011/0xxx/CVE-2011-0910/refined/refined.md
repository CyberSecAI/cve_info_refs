**Vulnerabilities:**
1. **Phishing Attack via `?Target` Parameter:**
    - **Root Cause:** The `?Target` parameter allowed users to be redirected to arbitrary remote websites without any confirmation, making it susceptible to phishing attacks.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of proper validation and sanitization of the `Target` parameter.
    - **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with the `?Target` parameter pointing to a malicious website.
    - **Attacker Capability:** Ability to create and distribute malicious links.
    - **Impact:** Users could be tricked into visiting malicious websites and potentially disclosing sensitive information or being infected with malware.

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attack via `?p` Parameter:**
    - **Root Cause:** The `?p` parameter was directly inserted into the page without sanitization.
    - **Weakness:** Lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input.
    - **Attack Vector:** Crafted URL with the `?p` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.
    - **Attacker Capability:** Ability to create and distribute malicious links.
    - **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

3. **Cookie HMAC Timing Attack:**
   - **Root Cause:**  A timing attack vulnerability in the HMAC cookie signing mechanism.
   - **Weakness:** Vulnerability related to the time taken for HMAC calculation, leading to information leakage.
   - **Attack Vector:** By observing the timing of responses, attackers could eventually spoof signed requests.
    -  **Attacker Capability:** A "clever" attacker with knowledge of timing attacks.
    - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized access to other user accounts by spoofing cookies.
