Subject: syslog-ng: log file permissions dangerous on kfreebsd-i386
Date: Fri, 31 Dec 2010 12:29:16 +0000
```
Package: syslog-ng
Version: 3.1.3-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security

Hello,

On kfreebsd-i386, installing the syslog-ng package with its default
configuration files, sets the permissions of system log files including
/var/log/messages, daemon.log, auth.log and perhaps others to
-rwsrwsrwt.  This happens whether the files previously existed or not.

This makes these log files world-readable, despite the perm(0640)
setting in syslog-ng.conf.  Non-privileged users can also truncate or
append to these files, but doing so seems to remove the setuid/setgid bits.

There may be a potential for root privilege escalation if a user can
cause syslog-ng to write executable commands to one of these log files.
 The files are not normally executable (text file busy) whilst syslog-ng
has them open for writing, but upon the next run of logrotate, the file
permissions including setuid/setgid bits are preserved.

 I can confirm this, not sure yet what's cause this. Upstream already
informed and hope it'll be fixed soon.
But an important note, for me it's slightly different. "Only" messages
and syslog are changed to chmod 7777; auth.log and daemon.log are not.

 While I don't know syslog-ng internals, I made some debug. It seems
syslog-ng uses chmod and derivatives only on three locations. During
install, only one of it is fired. It's src/afunix.c in afunix_sd_init():
it chmods /var/run/log to 0666.
Even ktrace didn't help me. The only chmod that can be suspicious in its
output:
chmod(0x679aa0,<invalid>438)
But it may refer to the error message printed on the screen:
mknod `/dev/console': Operation not supported

Hi Laszlo,

I think syslog-ng must wait for some data to be logged before it opens
those files for writing, and that must be when permissions are changed.
 If anything new has been written to your auth.log or daemon.log since
you checked, I think the permissions will have changed now.

Maybe that helps to narrow down where in the code this is happening?

Hi again,

I think I've managed to find the responsible system call using ktrace.
To begin with I set all of my log files as chmod 640, and then:

# ktrace -f ktrace.log -d /usr/sbin/syslog-ng -- -F -p
/var/run/syslog-ng.pid

Ctrl-C or kill that after about a second or so, then:

# kdump -f ktrace.log -m 4096 -n

This happens for each log file when first written to -- it is opened for
writing (requesting mode 0xffff if the file doesn't exist), then
chown'd/chgrp'd, and fchmod is called to ensure mode 0xffff:

  1384 syslog-ng CALL  open(0x80b1ae8,0x8205,0xffff)
  1384 syslog-ng NAMI  "/var/log/syslog"
  1384 syslog-ng RET   open 0x7
  1384 syslog-ng CALL  fcntl(0x7,0x1,0)
  1384 syslog-ng RET   fcntl 0
  1384 syslog-ng CALL  fcntl(0x7,0x2,0x1)
  1384 syslog-ng RET   fcntl 0
  1384 syslog-ng CALL  fchown(0x7,0,0xffffffff)
  1384 syslog-ng RET   fchown 0
  1384 syslog-ng CALL  fchown(0x7,0xffffffff,0x4)
  1384 syslog-ng RET   fchown 0
  1384 syslog-ng CALL  fchmod(0x7,0xffff)
  1384 syslog-ng RET   fchmod 0

Wherever affile_open_file is called, it seems the mode parameter is
initialised to -1 unless changed somewhere else in the code.  Then it's
tested in affile_open_file to see if it's >= 0.  Could the size or
signedness of mode_t be different on FreeBSD to Linux, resulting in the
0xffff?

```
The problem is that chwon(fn, -1) works differently on Linux than on
FreeBSD.

Linux doesn't change the permissions if mode is -1, FreeBSD does. The
workaround would be to test for -1 in syslog-ng and not call chmod in
those cases.

For the record, affile_open_file gets the same arguments even on Linux,
yet, permissions are eventually set right there. Thus, the problem is
entirely doe to chmod(fn, -1) behaving differently on the two systems.

A patch should be easy to cook up, one should be incoming soon, just
need to test it.

```

Hi,

bits/typesizes.h reveals that mode_t is u16 on kFreeBSD, rather than u32
on Linux.  So the dummy/rogue value of '-1' that file_perm or dir_perm
are initialised to, would be treated as a valid mode 0xffff.

u16 doesn't allow room for a dummy value any more, so I thought the
cleanest fix would be to define a DEFAULT_FILE_PERM and
DEFAULT_DIR_PERM, and initialise to those instead of -1.  Since the
'mode' variable will always contain something valid, it is no longer
necessary to check that when calling to open() and fchmod().

This is demonstrated in my attached patch, which I've only managed to
build on amd64 yet and not kFreeBSD, so it hasn't been properly tested.

Fortunately the uid/gid types are still u32 on kFreeBSD so there is no
issue with those.

Regards,

The problem - at a first guess - will be somewhere in the config file
parsing code or thereabouts. By the time syslog-ng gets to call
fchown(), the file mode is set to a horribly wrong value:

> #1  0x0000000000434d66 in affile_open_file (name=0x68e030 "/var/log/syslog", flags=33285, uid=0, gid=4, mode=65535, dir_uid=0, dir_gid=0, dir_mode=65535, create_dirs=0, privileged=0, is_pipe=0,
>     fd=0x7fffffffddbc) at affile.c:101
> 101             fchmod(*fd, (mode_t) mode);
> Current language:  auto
> The current source language is "auto; currently c".

If one looks at the parameters passed to affile_open_file, one can
notice that both mode and dir_mode are wrong. They're actually
(int16_t)-1.

This is on kfreebsd-amd64, so it looks like it's kfreebsd specific, and
the arch doesn't matter.

I will know more once I dived deeper in. With a bit of luck, I'll have a
fix sometime tomorrow, unless someone beats me to it.

tag 608491 + patch
done

Hi again,

I've managed to rebuild syslog-ng on kfreebsd-i386 with my previous
patch applied to properly test it.  syslog-ng now sets file permissions
on log files appropriately to the configuration setting of perm(), or
otherwise 0600 if it wasn't defined.  The patched version is still
working as expected on Linux amd64.

The new mode is used when a log file is created or has new data written
to it;  files that were mistakenly set mode 0xffff will be fixed by
upgrading.  But if any files don't have new data written to them, or
were already moved out of the way by logrotate, those will unavoidably
keep the buggy 0xffff setuid+setgid mode.

If using create_dirs(yes) in syslog-ng.conf (disabled by default in
Debian), the same bug was causing newly-created directories to have mode
0xffff.  My patch fixed this too, now using the configuration setting of
dir_perm(), or otherwise 0700 if it wasn't defined.  Directories that
have already been created by syslog-ng are never chmod'd again, so won't
be automatically fixed by this patch.

Regards,

Date: Sat, 01 Jan 2011 21:12:21 +0100
```
The issue is fixed in upstream git, differently than how Steven
proposed:

<http://git.balabit.hu/?p=bazsi/syslog-ng-3.1.git;a=commitdiff;h=cbcea8c95c3f07ed9eaa4d12f124db8f8ca2f74b;hp=61181dca938d2cdd8233df2a07d6e0c76f049e6f>

Bazsi's solution is to use gint instead of mode_t, so that syslog-ng can
continue using -1 as a special value. The actual chmod calls will only
be made if the permissions are correct, though.

I tested his patch on both Linux and kFreeBSD, and both behave after the
patch as expected.
