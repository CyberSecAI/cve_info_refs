  "CVE-2011-0030": {
    "description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) terminates a process when a user logs off. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run code designed to monitor the actions of a user who subsequently logged on to the system. This could allow the disclosure of sensitive information or access to data on the affected systems that was accessible to the logged-on user.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when the Windows Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) does not properly terminate user processes when a user logs off a system.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Elevation of Privilege"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could run code to monitor subsequent users' actions, potentially disclosing sensitive information including logon credentials. This could allow the attacker to elevate privileges or execute code as a different user. If an administrator logs on, the attacker could gain kernel-mode access to run arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local logon"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability. They need to run a specially crafted application designed to persist after the attacker logs off."
