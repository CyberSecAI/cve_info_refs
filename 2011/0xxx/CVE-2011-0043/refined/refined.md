{
  "CVE-2011-0043": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in implementations of Kerberos. The vulnerability exists because the Microsoft Kerberos implementation supports a weak hashing mechanism, which can allow for certain aspects of a Kerberos service ticket to be forged. A malicious user or attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could obtain a token with elevated privileges on the affected system.",
    "Root cause": "The Microsoft Kerberos implementation supports weak hashing mechanisms, specifically CRC32.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use of weak hashing algorithms in Kerberos implementation."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, authenticated attacker can gain elevated privileges by forging Kerberos service tickets.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access to a domain-joined computer.",
      "Installation of a malicious service."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Valid logon credentials to the local machine.",
      "Ability to install a malicious service on a domain-joined computer."
    ],
      "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is not exploitable on domains where the domain controllers are running Windows Server 2008 or Windows Server 2008 R2."
  },
    "CVE-2011-0091": {
        "Description": "A spoofing vulnerability exists in implementations of Kerberos on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. The vulnerability exists because it is possible to downgrade Kerberos authentication to use DES instead of the default, stronger encryption standards included in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.",
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the ability to downgrade Kerberos authentication to DES instead of using stronger encryption standards.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Lack of proper enforcement of stronger default encryption standards in Kerberos.",
           "Downgrade attack"
        ],
        "Impact": "An attacker can impersonate legitimate users or forge Kerberos traffic by downgrading the encryption standard to DES.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "Man-in-the-middle attack between client and server."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": [
          "Ability to intercept network communications between a Kerberos client and server."
        ],
         "Additional Information": "The vulnerability only affects Kerberos authentication."
    }
