{
  "CVE-2011-0480": {
    "Description": "Multiple buffer overflows in vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg, as used in Google Chrome before 8.0.552.237 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.344, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted WebM file, related to buffers for (1) the channel floor and (2) the channel residue.",
    "Root cause": "Multiple buffer overflows in the Vorbis decoder within the `vorbis_dec.c` file of FFmpeg.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflows related to handling of channel floor and channel residue data in the Vorbis decoder."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service, by triggering memory corruption and application crash. There is also the possibility of unspecified other impact through the vulnerability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted WebM file that contains specially crafted Vorbis audio data to trigger the overflow in FFmpeg."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker must be able to deliver a crafted WebM file to the vulnerable application. This may be achieved via web browsing or media file processing."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is located in the Vorbis decoder of FFmpeg's `vorbis_dec.c` file. The issue involves buffer overflows when processing channel floor and residue data, triggered by malformed WebM files."
