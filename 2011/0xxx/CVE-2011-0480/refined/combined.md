Package        : ffmpeg
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-3908 CVE-2010-4704 CVE-2011-0480 CVE-2011-0722
                 CVE-2011-0723
Debian Bug     : 611495

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ffmpeg, a multimedia player,
server and encoder.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:

CVE-2010-3908

   FFmpeg before 0.5.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
   via a malformed WMV file.

CVE-2010-4704

   libavcodec/vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted
   .ogg file, related to the vorbis_floor0_decode function.

CVE-2011-0480

   Multiple buffer overflows in vorbis_dec.c in the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg
   allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
   application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   WebM file, related to buffers for the channel floor and the channel residue.

CVE-2011-0722

   FFmpeg allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
   corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
   malformed RealMedia file.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.4-1.

Security support for ffmpeg has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny).
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.

We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Details

Cesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano discovered that FFmpeg

incorrectly handled certain malformed flic files. If a user were tricked

into opening a crafted flic file, an attacker could cause a denial of

service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the

privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-3429](/security/CVE-2010-3429))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed

wmv files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted wmv file, an

attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the

program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS.

([CVE-2010-3908](/security/CVE-2010-3908))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed ogg

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted ogg file, an attacker

could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2010-4704](/security/CVE-2010-4704))

It was discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed WebM

files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted WebM file, an attacker

could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

([CVE-2011-0480](/security/CVE-2011-0480))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed

RealMedia files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted RealMedia

file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or

possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking

the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Chrome Stable Release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2011/01/chrome-stable-release.html "Chrome Stable Release")

Wednesday, January 12, 2011

Chrome on stable channel has been updated to 8.0.552.237 for all platforms.  Chrome OS has also been updated, to 8.0.552.334. These releases contain the security fixes listed below.

Security fixes and rewards:

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

We’re delighted to offer our first “elite” $3133.7 [Chromium Security Reward](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/celebrating-six-months-of-chromium.html) to Sergey Glazunov. Critical bugs are harder to come by in Chrome, but Sergey has done it. Sergey also collects a $1337 reward and several other rewards at the same time, so congratulations Sergey!

Also of note is a clarification on our default charity policy. Some researchers are unable to accept rewards, or even provide a suggestion for a charity. In such cases, it feels like a shame to lose a charitable contribution so we will default reward money to the Red Cross.

The report is against Chrome and Chrome OS. I've failed to reproduce the
reported crashes with debian's version of ffmpeg; I get error messages
about corrupted vorbis headers, but no crash. Can you please provide a
testcase that applies to the debian copy of ffmpeg?

```
notfound 610550 4:0.5.2-6
tag 610550 -unreproducible
thanks

it looks like you're using a newer svn version of ffmpeg.  at least
0.5.2 in unstable doesn't yet support webm, so it isn't affected.  i
haven't checked 0.6.1 in experimental.

best wishes,
mike

I did and it doesn't crash for me.

With this rationale, I'm closing this bug for now, but by all means,
please reopen it as soon as you have a testcase for me.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

We released the new Iron 8 today, which contains all features and updates known from Chromim 8. The current version is 8.0.555.0.

Beside of the possibility to use the [AppStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) this release mainly contains bug- and securitypatches. But you can try new features with "about:flags".

DAmn! spoke too soon! The --enable-cookie-prompt doesn't work in this version. When is 8.0.555.1 coming out with the fixes that got lost in this release?

Oops! Just installed 8.0.555.0 and noticed that the speed dial page (so sue me I am mainly an Opera user) only shows 8 instead of 12 positions.

For me, this was a deal breaker, so it's back to 7.x for now.

What are the chances this could get repaired quickly? (what would be better would be a way to dial it in individually, as is possible with Opera - in my Opera browser I have 5 rows and 6 columns.)

***The problem with the many tabs was because of the extension "Webmail Ad Blocker" and "Open in the background Tab" extension" for Chrome.

The speed never disappoints me, IT'S FREAKING FAST AT LOADING!

Amazing product.***

***I was incorrect, neither one of extensions had impact, after I removed them.

I will stick to middle-click, for now. ![:P](./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz")

Speed still hasn't failed me, so nothing more to say.***

Great news! If based on Chromium then it's not only bug-fix release. There are some new features such as Chrome Web Store access. You can go there and install apps. The apps are accessible from the "new tab" page. I have not checked if it works in new Iron yet.

Huh...I'm going to wait to see if this gets fixed before i update. Watch out for that chrome apps store. I bet most of those apps have an auto-updater, which links you right to their servers, enableing some tracking features i got a warning pop-up when trying a couple out before. i terminated the install when i saw that.

Hello SRWare Iron 8 that has just been released seems to have this error coming up every so often when running on Windows XP Pro SP3:

iron.exe - Unable to Locate Component

This application has failed to start because d3dx9\_43.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

Didn't have this problem in earlier versions of Iron.

### September 30th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.1 "PÃ©ter"

[FFmpeg 7.1 "PÃ©ter"](download.html#release_7.1), a new
major release, is now available! A full list of changes can be found in the release
[changelog](https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/blob/refs/heads/release/7.1%3A/Changelog).

The more important highlights of the release are that the VVC decoder, merged as experimental in version 7.0,
has had enough time to mature and be optimized enough to be declared as stable. The codec is starting to gain
traction with broadcast standardization bodies.

Support has been added for a native AAC USAC (part of the xHE-AAC coding system) decoder, with the format starting
to be adopted by streaming websites, due to its extensive volume normalization metadata.

MV-HEVC decoding is now supported. This is a stereoscopic coding tool that begun to be shipped and generated
by recent phones and VR headsets.

LC-EVC decoding, an enhancement metadata layer to attempt to improve the quality of codecs, is now supported via an
external library.

Support for Vulkan encoding, with H264 and HEVC was merged. This finally allows fully Vulkan-based decode-filter-encode
pipelines, by having a sink for Vulkan frames, other than downloading or displaying them. The encoders have feature-parity
with their VAAPI implementation counterparts. Khronos has announced that support for AV1 encoding is also coming soon to Vulkan,
and FFmpeg is aiming to have day-one support.

In addition to the above, this release has had a lot of important internal work done. By far, the standout internally
are the improvements made for full-range images. Previously, color range data had two paths, no negotiation,
and was unreliably forwarded to filters, encoders, muxers. Work on cleaning the system up started more than 10
years ago, however this stalled due to how fragile the system was, and that breaking behaviour would be unacceptable.
The new system fixes this, so now color range is forwarded correctly and consistently everywhere needed, and also
laid the path for more advanced forms of negotiation.

Cropping metadata is now supported with Matroska and MP4 formats. This metadata is important not only for archival,
but also with AV1, as hardware encoders require its signalling due to the codec not natively supporting one.

As usual, we recommend that users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.

### September 11th, 2024, Coverity

The number of issues FFmpeg has in [Coverity (a static analyzer)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/ffmpeg) is now lower than it has been since 2016.
Our defect density is less than one 30th of the average in OSS with over a million code
lines. All this was possible thanks to a grant from the [Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/).

![Coverity Lifetime Graph till 2024-08](img/coverity-lifetime-2024-08.PNG)
### June 2nd, 2024, native xHE-AAC decoder

FFmpeg now implements a native xHE-AAC decoder. Currently, streams without (e)SBR, USAC or MPEG-H Surround
are supported, which means the majority of xHE-AAC streams in use should work. Support for USAC and (e)SBR is
coming soon. Work is also ongoing to improve its stability and compatibility.
During the process we found several specification issues, which were then submitted back to the authors
for discussion and potential inclusion in a future errata.

### May 13th, 2024, Sovereign Tech Fund

The FFmpeg community is excited to announce that Germany's
[Sovereign Tech Fund](https://www.sovereigntechfund.de/tech/ffmpeg)
has become its first governmental sponsor. Their support will help
sustain the maintainance of the FFmpeg project, a critical open-source
software multimedia component essential to bringing audio and video to
billions around the world everyday.

### April 5th, 2024, FFmpeg 7.0 "Dijkstra"

A new major release, [FFmpeg 7.0 "Dijkstra"](download.html#release_7.0),
is now available for download. The most noteworthy changes for most users are
a [native VVC decoder](#vvcdec) (currently experimental, until more
fuzzing is done), [IAMF support](#iamf), or a
[multi-threaded `ffmpeg` CLI tool](#cli_threading).

This release is *not* backwards compatible, removing APIs deprecated before 6.0.
The biggest change for most library callers will be the removal of the old bitmask-based
channel layout API, replaced by the `AVChannelLayout` API allowing such
features as custom channel ordering, or Ambisonics. Certain deprecated `ffmpeg`
CLI options were also removed, and a C11-compliant compiler is now required to build
the code.

As usual, there is also a number of new supported formats and codecs, new filters, APIs,
and countless smaller features and bugfixes. Compared to 6.1, the `git` repository
contains almost ∼2000 new commits by ∼100 authors, touching >100000 lines in
∼2000 files — thanks to everyone who contributed. See the
[Changelog](https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog;hb=n7.0),
[APIchanges](https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=doc/APIchanges;hb=n7.0),
and the git log for more comprehensive lists of changes.

### January 3rd, 2024, native VVC decoder

The `libavcodec` library now contains a native VVC (Versatile Video Coding)
decoder, supporting a large subset of the codec's features. Further optimizations and
support for more features are coming soon. The code was written by Nuo Mi, Xu Mu,
Frank Plowman, Shaun Loo, and Wu Jianhua.

### December 18th, 2023, IAMF support

The `libavformat` library can now read and write [IAMF](https://aomediacodec.github.io/iamf/)
(Immersive Audio) files. The `ffmpeg` CLI tool can configure IAMF structure with the new
`-stream_group` option. IAMF support was written by James Almer.

### December 12th, 2023, multi-threaded `ffmpeg` CLI tool

Thanks to a major refactoring of the `ffmpeg` command-line tool, all the major
components of the transcoding pipeline (demuxers, decoders, filters, encodes, muxers) now
run in parallel. This should improve throughput and CPU utilization, decrease latency,
and open the way to other exciting new features.

Note that you should *not* expect significant performance improvements in cases
where almost all computational time is spent in a single component (typically video
encoding).

### November 10th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.1 "Heaviside"

* ffprobe -output\_format option added as an alias of -of

This release had been overdue for at least half a year, but due to constant activity in the repository,
had to be delayed, and we were finally able to branch off the release recently, before some of the large
changes scheduled for 7.0 were merged.

Internally, we have had a number of changes too. The FFT, MDCT, DCT and DST implementation used for codecs
and filters has been fully replaced with the faster libavutil/tx (full article about it coming soon).

This also led to a reduction in the the size of the compiled binary, which can be noticeable in small builds.

There was a very large reduction in the total amount of allocations being done on each frame throughout video decoders,
reducing overhead.

RISC-V optimizations for many parts of our DSP code have been merged, with mainly the large decoders being left.

There was an effort to improve the correctness of timestamps and frame durations of each packet, increasing the
accurracy of variable frame rate video.

Next major release will be version 7.0, scheduled to be released in February. We will attempt to better stick
to the new release schedule we announced at the start of this year.

We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.

### May 31st, 2023, Vulkan decoding

A few days ago, Vulkan-powered decoding hardware acceleration code was merged into the codebase.
This is the first vendor-generic and platform-generic decode acceleration API, enabling the
same code to be used on multiple platforms, with very minimal overhead.
This is also the first multi-threaded hardware decoding API, and our code makes full use of this,
saturating all available decode engines the hardware exposes.

Those wishing to test the code can read our
[documentation page](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/HWAccelIntro#Vulkan).
For those who would like to integrate FFmpeg's Vulkan code to demux, parse, decode, and receive
a VkImage to present or manipulate, documentation and examples are available in our source tree.
Currently, using the latest available git checkout of our
[repository](https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=summary) is required.
The functionality will be included in stable branches with the release of version 6.1, due
to be released soon.

As this is also the first practical implementation of the specifications, bugs may be present,
particularly in drivers, and, although passing verification, the implementation itself.
New codecs, and encoding support are also being worked on, by both the Khronos organization
for standardizing, and us as implementing it, and giving feedback on improving.

### February 28th, 2023, FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"

A new major release, [FFmpeg 6.0 "Von Neumann"](download.html#release_6.0),
is now available for download. This release has many new encoders and decoders, filters,
ffmpeg CLI tool improvements, and also, changes the way releases are done. All major
releases will now bump the version of the ABI. We plan to have a new major release each
year. Another release-specific change is that deprecated APIs will be removed after 3
releases, upon the next major bump.
This means that releases will be done more often and will be more organized.

New decoders featured are Bonk, RKA, Radiance, SC-4, APAC, VQC, WavArc and a few ADPCM formats.
QSV and NVenc now support AV1 encoding. The FFmpeg CLI (we usually reffer to it as ffmpeg.c
to avoid confusion) has speed-up improvements due to threading, as well as statistics options,
and the ability to pass option values for filters from a file. There are quite a few new audio
and video filters, such as adrc, showcwt, backgroundkey and ssim360, with a few hardware ones too.
Finally, the release features many behind-the-scenes changes, including a new FFT and MDCT
implementation used in codecs (expect a blog post about this soon), numerous bugfixes, better
ICC profile handling and colorspace signalling improvement, introduction of a number of RISC-V
vector and scalar assembly optimized routines, and a few new improved APIs, which can be viewed
in the doc/APIchanges file in our tree.
A few submitted features, such as the Vulkan improvements and more FFT optimizations will be in the
next minor release, 6.1, which we plan to release soon, in line with our new release schedule.

### October 5th, 2019, Bright Lights

FFmpeg has added a realtime bright flash removal filter to libavfilter.

Note that this filter is not FDA approved, nor are we medical professionals.
Nor has this filter been tested with anyone who has photosensitive epilepsy.
FFmpeg and its photosensitivity filter are not making any medical claims.

That said, this is a new video filter that may help photosensitive people
watch tv, play video games or even be used with a VR headset to block
out epiletic triggers such as filtered sunlight when they are outside.
Or you could use it against those annoying white flashes on your tv screen.
The filter fails on some input, such as the
[Incredibles 2 Screen Slaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L_9hXnUzRk)
scene. It is not perfect. If you have other clips that you want this filter to
work better on, please report them to us on our [trac](http://trac.ffmpeg.org).

[See for yourself](http://ffmpeg.org/~compn/output20p8.mp4).
Example was made with -vf photosensitivity=20:0.8

We are not professionals. Please use this in your medical studies to
advance epilepsy research. If you decide to use this in a medical
setting, or make a hardware hdmi input output realtime tv filter,
or find another use for this, please let me know.
This filter was a feature request of mine
[since 2013](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/ticket/2104).

### October 30th, 2016, Results: Summer Of Code 2016.

This has been a long time coming but we wanted to give a proper closure to our participation in this run of the program and it takes time. Sometimes it's just to get the final report for each project trimmed down, others, is finalizing whatever was still in progress when the program finished: final patches need to be merged, TODO lists stabilized, future plans agreed; you name it.

Without further ado, here's the silver-lining for each one of the projects we sought to complete during this Summer of Code season:

#### FFv1 (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)

Stanislav Dolganov designed and implemented experimental support for motion estimation and compensation in the lossless FFV1 codec. The design and implementation is based on the snow video codec, which uses OBMC. Stanislav's work proved that significant compression gains can be achieved with inter frame compression. FFmpeg welcomes Stanislav to continue working beyond this proof of concept and bring its advances into the official FFV1 specification within the IETF.

#### Self test coverage (Mentor: Michael Niedermayer)

Petru Rares Sincraian added several self-tests to FFmpeg and successfully went through the in-some-cases tedious process of fine tuning tests parameters to avoid known and hard to avoid problems, like checksum mismatches due to rounding errors on the myriad of platforms we support. His work has improved the code coverage of our self tests considerably.

#### MPEG-4 ALS encoder implementation (Mentor: Thilo Borgmann)

Umair Khan updated and integrated the ALS encoder to fit in the current FFmpeg codebase. He also implemented a missing feature for the ALS decoder that enables floating-point sample decoding. FFmpeg support for MPEG-4 ALS has been improved significantly by Umair's work. We welcome him to keep maintaining his improvements and hope for great contributions to come.

#### Tee muxer improvements (Mentor: Marton Balint)

JÃ¡n SebechlebskÃ½'s generic goal was to improve the tee muxer so it tolerated blocking IO and allowed transparent error recovery. During the design phase it turned out that this functionality called for a separate muxer, so JÃ¡n spent his summer working on the so-called FIFO muxer, gradually fixing issues all over the codebase. He succeeded in his task, and the FIFO muxer is now part of the main repository, alongside several other improvements he made in the process.

#### TrueHD encoder (Mentor: Rostislav Pehlivanov)

Jai Luthra's objective was to update the out-of-tree and pretty much abandoned MLP (Meridian Lossless Packing) encoder for libavcodec and improve it to enable encoding to the TrueHD format. For the qualification period the encoder was updated such that it was usable and throughout the summer, successfully improved adding support for multi-channel audio and TrueHD encoding. Jai's code has been merged into the main repository now. While a few problems remain with respect to LFE channel and 32 bit sample handling, these are in the process of being fixed such that effort can be finally put in improving the encoder's speed and efficiency.

#### Motion interpolation filter (Mentor: Paul B Mahol)

Davinder Singh investigated existing motion estimation and interpolation approaches from the available literature and previous work by our own: Michael Niedermayer, and implemented filters based on this research. These filters allow motion interpolating frame rate conversion to be applied to a video, for example, to create a slow motion effect or change the frame rate while smoothly interpolating the video along the motion vectors. There's still work to be done to call these filters 'finished', which is rather hard all things considered, but we are looking optimistically at their future.

And that's it. We are happy with the results of the program and immensely thankful for the opportunity of working with such an amazing set of students. We can be a tough crowd but our mentors did an amazing job at hand holding our interns through their journey. Thanks also to Google for this wonderful program and to everyone that made room in their busy lives to help making GSoC2016 a success. See you in 2017!

### September 24th, 2016, SDL1 support dropped.

Support for the SDL1 library has been dropped, due to it no longer being maintained (as of
January, 2012) and it being superseded by the SDL2 library. As a result, the SDL1 output device
has also been removed and replaced by an SDL2 implementation. Both the ffplay and opengl output
devices have been updated to support SDL2.

### August 9th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.2 "Laplace"

[FFmpeg 3.1.2](download.html#release_3.1), a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
It fixes several bugs.

We recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, to upgrade unless they use current git master.

### July 10th, 2016, ffserver program being dropped

After thorough deliberation, we're announcing that we're about to drop the ffserver program from the project starting with the next release.
ffserver has been a problematic program to maintain due to its use of internal APIs, which complicated the recent cleanups to the libavformat
library, and block further cleanups and improvements which are desired by API users and will be easier to maintain. Furthermore the program has
been hard for users to deploy and run due to reliability issues, lack of knowledgable people to help and confusing configuration file syntax.
Current users and members of the community are invited to write a replacement program to fill the same niche that ffserver did using the new APIs
and to contact us so we may point users to test and contribute to its development.

### July 1st, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1.1 "Laplace"

[FFmpeg 3.1.1](download.html#release_3.1), a new point release from the 3.1 release branch, is now available!
It mainly deals with a few ABI issues introduced in the previous release.

We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators, especially those who experienced issues upgrading from 3.0, to
upgrade unless they use current git master.

### June 27th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.1 "Laplace"

FFmpeg has been accepted as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) open source organization. If you wish to
participate as a student see our [project ideas page](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/GSoC/2016).
You can already get in contact with mentors and start working on qualification tasks as well as register at google and submit your project proposal draft.
Good luck!

### February 15th, 2016, FFmpeg 3.0 "Einstein"

[FFmpeg 3.0 "Einstein"](download.html#release_3.0), a new
major release, is now available! Some of the highlights:

* [The native FFmpeg AAC encoder has seen extensive improvements and is no longer considered experimental](#aac_encoder_stable)
* [Removed support for libvo-aacenc and libaacplus](#removing_external_aac_encoders)
* Over 30 new filters have been added
* Many ASM optimizations
* VP9 Hardware Acceleration (DXVA2 and VA-API)
* Cineform HD decoder

* As with all major releases expect major backward incompatible API/ABI changes
* See the [Changelog](https://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob_plain;f=Changelog;hb=n3.0) for a list of more updates

We strongly recommend users, distributors, and system integrators to
upgrade unless they use current git master.

### January 30, 2016, Removing support for two external AAC encoders

We have just removed support for VisualOn AAC encoder (libvo-aacenc) and
libaacplus in FFmpeg master.

Even before marking our internal AAC encoder as
[stable](#aac_encoder_stable), it was known that libvo-aacenc
was of an inferior quality compared to our native one for most samples.
However, the VisualOn encoder was used extensively by the Android Open
Source Project, and we would like to have a tested-and-true stable option
in our code base.

When first committed in 2011, libaacplus filled in the gap of encoding
High Efficiency AAC formats (HE-AAC and HE-AACv2), which was not supported
by any of the encoders in FFmpeg at that time.

The circumstances for both have changed. After the work spearheaded by
Rostislav Pehlivanov and Claudio Freire, the now-stable FFmpeg native AAC
encoder is ready to compete with much more mature encoders. The Fraunhofer
FDK AAC Codec Library for Android was added in 2012 as the fourth
supported external AAC encoder, and the one with the best quality and the
most features supported, including HE-AAC and HE-AACv2.

Therefore, we have decided that it is time to remove libvo-aacenc and
libaacplus. If you are currently using libvo-aacenc, prepare to transition
to the native encoder (`aac`) when updating to the next version
of FFmpeg. In most cases it is as simple as merely swapping the encoder
name. If you are currently using libaacplus, start using FDK AAC
(`libfdk_aac`) with an appropriate `profile` option
to select the exact AAC profile that fits your needs. In both cases, you
will enjoy an audible quality improvement and as well as fewer licensing
headaches.

Enjoy!

### January 16, 2016, FFmpeg 2.8.5, 2.7.5, 2.6.7, 2.5.10

We have made several new point releases (**[2.8.5](download.html#release_2.8),
[2.7.5](download.html#release_2.7),
[2.6.7](download.html#release_2.6),
[2.5.10](download.html#release_2.5)**).
They fix various bugs, as well as CVE-2016-1897 and CVE-2016-1898.
Please see the changelog for each release for more details.

We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
current git master.

### December 5th, 2015, The native FFmpeg AAC encoder is now stable!

After seven years the native FFmpeg AAC encoder has had its experimental flag
removed and declared as ready for general use. The encoder is transparent
at 128kbps for most samples tested with artifacts only appearing in extreme
cases. Subjective quality tests put the encoder to be of equal or greater
quality than most of the other encoders available to the public.

Licensing has always been an issue with encoding AAC audio as most of the
encoders have had a license making FFmpeg unredistributable if compiled with
support for them. The fact that there now exists a fully open and truly
free AAC encoder integrated directly within the project means a lot to those
who wish to use accepted and widespread standards.

The majority of the work done to bring the encoder up to quality was started
during this year's GSoC by developer Claudio Freire and Rostislav Pehlivanov.
Both continued to work on the encoder with the latter joining as a developer
and mainainer, working on other parts of the project as well. Also, thanks
to [Kamedo2](http://d.hatena.ne.jp/kamedo2/) who does comparisons
and tests, the original authors and all past and current contributors to the
encoder. Users are suggested and encouraged to use the encoder and provide
feedback or breakage reports through our [bug tracker](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/).

### October 13th, 2015, Telepoint & MediaHub are now supporting our project

A big thank you note goes to our newest supporters: MediaHub and Telepoint.
Both companies have donated a dedicated server with free of charge internet
connectivity. Here is a little bit about them in their own words:

* [Telepoint](http://www.telepoint.bg/en/) is the biggest
  carrier-neutral data center in Bulgaria. Located in the heart of Sofia
  on a cross-road of many Bulgarian and International networks, the
  facility is a fully featured Tier 3 data center that provides flexible
  customer-oriented colocation solutions (ranging from a server to a
  private collocation hall) and a high level of security.
* MediaHub Ltd. is a Bulgarian IPTV platform and services provider which
  uses FFmpeg heavily since it started operating a year ago. *"Donating
  to help keep FFmpeg online is our way of giving back to the community"*.

Thanks Telepoint and MediaHub for their support!

### September 29th, 2015, GSoC 2015 results

FFmpeg participated to the latest edition of
the [Google
Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) Project. FFmpeg got a total of 8 assigned
projects, and 7 of them were successful.

We want to thank [Google](https://www.google.com), the
participating students, and especially the mentors who joined this
effort. We're looking forward to participating in the next GSoC
edition!

Below you can find a brief description of the final outcome of
each single project.

#### Basic servers for network protocols, mentee: Stephan Holljes, mentor: Nicolas George

Stephan Holljes's project for this session of Google Summer of Code was to
implement basic HTTP server features for libavformat, to complement the
already present HTTP client and RTMP and RTSP server code.

The first part of the project was to make the HTTP code capable of accepting
a single client; it was completed partly during the qualification period and
partly during the first week of the summer. Thanks to this work, it is now
possible to make a simple HTTP stream using the following commands:

```

    ffmpeg -i /dev/video0 -listen 1 -f matroska \
    -c:v libx264 -preset fast -tune zerolatency http://:8080
    ffplay http://localhost:8080/

```

The next part of the project was to extend the code to be able to accept
several clients, simultaneously or consecutively. Since libavformat did not
have an API for that kind of task, it was necessary to design one. This part
was mostly completed before the midterm and applied shortly afterwards.
Since the ffmpeg command-line tool is not ready to serve several clients,
the test ground for that new API is an example program serving hard-coded
content.

The last and most ambitious part of the project was to update ffserver to
make use of the new API. It would prove that the API is usable to implement
real HTTP servers, and expose the points where more control was needed. By
the end of the summer, a first working patch series was undergoing code
review.

#### Browsing content on the server, mentee: Mariusz SzczepaÅczyk, mentor: Lukasz Marek

Mariusz finished an API prepared by the FFmpeg community and implemented
Samba directory listing as qualification task.

During the program he extended the API with the possibility to
remove and rename files on remote servers. He completed the
implementation of these features for file, Samba, SFTP, and FTP
protocols.

At the end of the program, Mariusz provided a sketch of an
implementation for HTTP directory listening.

#### Directshow digital video capture, mentee: Mate Sebok, mentor: Roger Pack

Mate was working on directshow input from digital video sources. He
got working input from ATSC input sources, with specifiable tuner.

The code has not been committed, but a patch of it was sent to the
ffmpeg-devel mailing list for future use.

The mentor plans on cleaning it up and committing it, at least for the
ATSC side of things. Mate and the mentor are still working trying to
finally figure out how to get DVB working.

#### Implementing full support for 3GPP Timed Text Subtitles, mentee: Niklesh Lalwani, mentor: Philip Langdale

Niklesh's project was to expand our support for 3GPP Timed Text
subtitles. This is the native subtitle format for mp4 containers, and
is interesting because it's usually the only subtitle format supported
by the stock playback applications on iOS and Android devices.

ffmpeg already had basic support for these subtitles which ignored all
formatting information - it just provided basic plain-text support.

Niklesh did work to add support on both the encode and decode side for
text formatting capabilities, such as font size/colour and effects like
bold/italics, highlighting, etc.

The main challenge here is that Timed Text handles formatting in a very
different way from most common subtitle formats. It uses a binary
encoding (based on mp4 boxes, naturally) and stores information
separately from the text itself. This requires additional work to track
which parts of the text formatting applies to, and explicitly dealing
with overlapping formatting (which other formats support but Timed
Text does not) so it requires breaking the overlapping sections into
separate non-overlapping ones with different formatting.

Finally, Niklesh had to be careful about not trusting any size
information in the subtitles - and that's no joke: the now infamous
Android stagefright bug was in code for parsing Timed Text subtitles.

All of Niklesh's work is committed and was released in ffmpeg 2.8.

#### libswscale refactoring, mentee: Pedro Arthur, mentors: Michael Niedermayer, Ramiro Polla

Pedro Arthur has modularized the vertical and horizontal scalers.
To do this he designed and implemented a generic filter framework
and moved the existing scaler code into it. These changes now allow
easily adding removing, splitting or merging processing steps.
The implementation was benchmarked and several alternatives were
tried to avoid speed loss.

He also added gamma corrected scaling support.
An example to use gamma corrected scaling would be:

```

    ffmpeg -i input -vf scale=512:384:gamma=1 output

```

Pedro has done impressive work considering the short time available,
and he is a FFmpeg committer now. He continues to contribute to
FFmpeg, and has fixed some bugs in libswscale after GSoC has
ended.

#### AAC Encoder Improvements, mentee: Rostislav Pehlivanov, mentor: Claudio Freire

Rostislav Pehlivanov has implemented PNS, TNS, I/S coding and main
prediction on the native AAC encoder. Of all those extensions, only
TNS was left in a less-than-usable state, but the implementation has
been pushed (disabled) anyway since it's a good basis for further
improvements.

PNS replaces noisy bands with a single scalefactor representing the
energy of that band, gaining in coding efficiency considerably, and
the quality improvements on low bitrates are impressive for such a
simple feature.

TNS still needs some polishing, but has the potential to reduce coding
artifacts by applying noise shaping in the temporal domain (something
that is a source of annoying, notable distortion on low-entropy
bands).

Intensity Stereo coding (I/S) can double coding efficiency by
exploiting strong correlation between stereo channels, most effective
on pop-style tracks that employ panned mixing. The technique is not as
effective on classic X-Y recordings though.

Finally, main prediction improves coding efficiency by exploiting
correlation among successive frames. While the gains have not been
huge at this point, Rostislav has remained active even after the GSoC,
and is polishing both TNS and main prediction, as well as looking for
further improvements to make.

In the process, the MIPS port of the encoder was broken a few times,
something he's also working to fix.

#### Animated Portable Network Graphics (APNG), mentee: Donny Yang, mentor: Paul B Mahol

Donny Yang implemented basic keyframe only APNG encoder as the
qualification task. Later he wrote interframe compression via
various blend modes. The current implementation tries all blend
modes and picks one which takes the smallest amount of memory.

Special care was taken to make sure that the decoder plays
correctly all files found in the wild and that the encoder
produces files that can be played in browsers that support APNG.

During his work he was tasked to fix any encountered bug in the
decoder due to the fact that it doesn't match APNG
specifications. Thanks to this work, a long standing bug in the
PNG decoder has been fixed.

For latter work he plans to continue working on the encoder,
making it possible to select which blend modes will be used in the
encoding process. This could speed up encoding of APNG files.

### September 9th, 2015, FFmpeg 2.8

We published release **[2.8](download.html#release_2.8)** as new major version.
It contains all features and bug fixes of the git master branch from September 8th. Please see
the **[changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/release/2.8/Changelog)**
for a list of the most important changes.

We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use current git master.

### August 1st, 2015, A message from the FFmpeg project

Dear multimedia community,

The resignation of Michael Niedermayer as leader of FFmpeg yesterday has
come by surprise. He has worked tirelessly on the FFmpeg project for many
years and we must thank him for the work that he has done. We hope that in
the future he will continue to contribute to the project. In the coming
weeks, the FFmpeg project will be managed by the active contributors.

The last four years have not been easy for our multimedia community - both
contributors and users. We should now look to the future, try to find
solutions to these issues, and to have reconciliation between the forks,
which have split the community for so long.

Unfortunately, much of the disagreement has taken place in inappropriate
venues so far, which has made finding common ground and solutions
difficult. We aim to discuss this in our communities online over the coming
weeks, and in person at the [VideoLAN Developer
Days](https://www.videolan.org/videolan/events/vdd15/) in Paris in September: a neutral venue for the entire open source
multimedia community.

The FFmpeg project.

### July 4th, 2015, FFmpeg needs a new host

**UPDATE:** We have received more than 7 offers for hosting and servers, thanks a lot to everyone!

### March 1, 2015, Chemnitzer Linux-Tage

We happily announce that FFmpeg will be represented at Chemnitzer Linux-Tage
(CLT) in Chemnitz, Germany. The event will take place on 21st and 22nd of March.

More information can be found [here](https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2015/en/)

We demonstrate usage of FFmpeg, answer your questions and listen to
your problems and wishes. **If you have media files that cannot be
processed correctly with FFmpeg, be sure to have a sample with you
so we can have a look!**

For the first time in our CLT history, there will be an **FFmpeg workshop**!
You can read the details [here](https://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2015/de/programm/beitrag/209).
The workshop is targeted at FFmpeg beginners. First the basics of
multimedia will be covered. Thereafter you will learn how to use
that knowledge and the FFmpeg CLI tools to analyse and process media
files. The workshop is in German language only and prior registration
is necessary. The workshop will be on Saturday starting at 10 o'clock.

We are looking forward to meet you (again)!

### December 5, 2014, FFmpeg 2.5

### October 10, 2014, FFmpeg is in Debian unstable again

We wanted you to know there are
[FFmpeg packages in Debian unstable](https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=ffmpeg&searchon=sourcenames&suite=unstable&section=main) again. **A big thank-you
to Andreas Cadhalpun and all the people that made it possible.** It has been anything but simple.

Unfortunately that was already the easy part of this news. The bad news is the packages probably won't
migrate to Debian testing to be in the upcoming release codenamed jessie.
[Read the argumentation over at Debian.](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763148)

**However things will come out in the end, we hope for your continued remarkable support!**

### October 8, 2014, FFmpeg secured a place in OPW!

Thanks to a generous 6K USD donation by Samsung (Open Source Group),
FFmpeg will be welcoming at least 1 "Outreach Program for Women" intern
to work with our community for an initial period starting December 2014
(through March 2015).

We all know FFmpeg is used by the industry, but even while there are
countless products building on our code, it is not at all common for
companies to step up and help us out when needed. So a big thank-you
to Samsung and the OPW program committee!

If you are thinking on participating in OPW as an intern, please take
a look at our [OPW wiki page](https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/SponsoringPrograms/OPW/2014-12)
for some initial guidelines. The page is still a work in progress, but
there should be enough information there to get you started. If you, on
the other hand, are thinking on sponsoring work on FFmpeg through the
OPW program, please get in touch with us at opw@ffmpeg.org. With your
help, we might be able to secure some extra intern spots for this round!

### September 15, 2014, FFmpeg 2.4

current git master.

### July 29, 2014, Help us out securing our spot in OPW

Following our previous post regarding our participation on this year's
OPW (Outreach Program for Women), we are now reaching out to our users
(both individuals and companies) to help us gather the needed money to
secure our spot in the program.

We need to put together 6K USD as a minimum but securing more funds would
help us towards getting more than one intern.

You can donate by credit card using
[Click&Pledge](https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=56226) and selecting the "OPW" option. If you would like to
donate by money transfer or by check, please get in touch by
e-mail and we will get back to you
with instructions.
Thanks!

### July 20, 2014, New website

The FFmpeg project is proud to announce a brand new version of the website
made by [db0](http://db0.fr). While this was initially motivated
by the need for a larger menu, the whole website ended up being redesigned,
and most pages got reworked to ease navigation. We hope you'll enjoy
browsing it.

### July 17, 2014, FFmpeg 2.3

We have made a new major release (**[2.3](download.html#release_2.3)**)
It contains all features and bugfixes of the git master branch from the 16th July.
Please see the **[Release Notes](http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git;a=blob;f=RELEASE_NOTES;hb=489d066)** for a

current git master.

### July 3, 2014, FFmpeg and the Outreach Program For Women

FFmpeg has started the process to become an OPW includer organization for the
next round of the program, with internships starting December 9. The
[OPW](https://gnome.org/opw/) aims to "Help women (cis and trans)
and genderqueer to get involved in free and open source software". Part of the
process requires securing funds to support at least one internship (6K USD), so
if you were holding on your donation to FFmpeg, this is a great chance for you
to come forward, get in touch and help both the project and a great initiative!

We have set up an email address you can use
to contact us about donations and general inquires regarding our participation
in the program. Hope to hear from you soon!

### June 29, 2014, FFmpeg 2.2.4, 2.1.5, 2.0.5, 1.2.7, 1.1.12, 0.10.14

[1.2.7](download.html#release_1.2),
[1.1.12](download.html#release_1.1),
[0.10.14](download.html#release_0.10)**).
They fix a
[security issue in the LZO implementation](http://blog.securitymouse.com/2014/06/raising-lazarus-20-year-old-bug-that.html),
as well as several other bugs. See the git log for details.

We recommend users, distributors and system integrators to upgrade unless they use
current git master.

### May 1, 2014, LinuxTag

Once again FFmpeg will be represented at LinuxTag in Berlin, Germany. The event will
take place from 8th to 10th of May. Please note that this year's LinuxTag is at a
different location closer to the city center.

We will have a shared booth with XBMC and VideoLAN.
**If you have media files that cannot be processed correctly with
FFmpeg, be sure to have a sample with you so we can have a look!**

More information about LinuxTag can be found [here](http://www.linuxtag.org/2014/)

We are looking forward to see you in Berlin!

### April 18, 2014, OpenSSL Heartbeat bug

Our server hosting the Trac issue tracker was vulnerable to the attack
against OpenSSL known as "heartbleed". The OpenSSL software library
was updated on 7th of April, shortly after the vulnerability was publicly
disclosed. We have changed the private keys (and certificates) for all
FFmpeg servers. The details were sent to the mailing lists by
Alexander Strasser, who is part of the project server team. Here is a
link to the user mailing list
[archive](https://lists.ffmpeg.org/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2014-April/020968.html)

### February 3, 2014, Chemnitzer Linux-Tage

We happily announce that FFmpeg will be represented at `Chemnitzer Linux-Tage'
in Chemnitz, Germany. The event will take place on 15th and 16th of March.

More information can be found [here](http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2014/en/info/)

We invite you to visit us at our booth located in the Linux-Live area!
There we will demonstrate usage of FFmpeg, answer your questions and listen to
your problems and wishes.

**If you have media files that cannot be processed correctly with
FFmpeg, be sure to have a sample with you so we can have a look!**

We are looking forward to meet you (again)!

### February 9, 2014, trac.ffmpeg.org / trac.mplayerhq.hu Security Breach

The server on which FFmpeg and MPlayer Trac issue trackers were
installed was compromised. The affected server was taken offline
and has been replaced and all software reinstalled.
FFmpeg Git, releases, FATE, web and mailinglists are on other servers
and were not affected. We believe that the original compromise happened
to a server, unrelated to FFmpeg and MPlayer, several months ago.
That server was used as a source to clone the VM that we recently moved
Trac to. It is not known if anyone used the backdoor that was found.

We recommend all users to change their passwords.
**Especially users who use a password on Trac that they also use
elsewhere, should change that password at least elsewhere.**

### November 12, 2013, FFmpeg RFP in Debian

Since the splitting of Libav the Debian/Ubuntu maintainers have followed
the Libav fork. Many people have requested the packaging of ffmpeg in
Debian, as it is more feature-complete and in many cases less buggy.

[RogÃ©rio Brito](http://cynic.cc/blog/), a Debian developer,
has proposed a Request For Package (RFP) in the Debian bug tracking
system.

Please let the Debian and Ubuntu developers know that you support packaging
of the real FFmpeg! See Debian [ticket #729203](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=729203)
for more details.

### October 28, 2013, FFmpeg 2.1
