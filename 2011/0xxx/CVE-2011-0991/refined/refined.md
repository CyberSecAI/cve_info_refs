        "root_cause": "Use-after-free due to DynamicMethod resurrection.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue.",
          "DynamicMethod objects were not being properly cleaned up, potentially leading to their resurrection."

        "impact": "The use-after-free could lead to breaking out of the moonlight sandboxing.",
        "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is related to how DynamicMethods are handled in the Mono runtime, specifically during garbage collection and finalization. The attacker would need to find a way to trigger the premature freeing of DynamicMethod objects then utilize a resurrected DynamicMethod object.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need the ability to execute code within the Moonlight environment and have knowledge of how DynamicMethod objects are managed and garbage collected in order to exploit the vulnerability."
