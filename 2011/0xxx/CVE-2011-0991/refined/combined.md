Don't use finalization to cleanup dynamic methods.

```
        * reflection.c: Use a reference queue to cleanup
        dynamic methods instead of finalization.

        * runtime.c: Shutdown the dynamic method queue
        before runtime cleanup begins.

        * DynamicMethod.cs: No longer finalizable.

        * icall-def.h: Remove unused dynamic method icall.

        Fixes #660422

    Implement a reference queue API.

        * gc.c: A reference queue allows one to queue
        callbcks for when objects are collected.
        It allows for safe cleanup of objects that can
        only be done when it is effectively collected.
        The major difference with regular finalization
        is that the collector makes sure the object
        was collected - and can't be resurrected.

        * gc-internal.h: Export entrypoints for the
        new API.
```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

	* reflection.c: Use a reference queue to cleanup
	dynamic methods instead of finalization.

	* runtime.c: Shutdown the dynamic method queue
	before runtime cleanup begins.

	* DynamicMethod.cs: No longer finalizable.

	* icall-def.h: Remove unused dynamic method icall.

	Fixes #660422

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Implement a reference queue API.

```
	* gc.c: A reference queue allows one to queue
	callbcks for when objects are collected.
	It allows for safe cleanup of objects that can
	only be done when it is effectively collected.
	The major difference with regular finalization
	is that the collector makes sure the object
	was collected - and can't be resurrected.

	* gc-internal.h: Export entrypoints for the
	new API.

Message-ID: <20110406180648.GA3660@suse.de>
Date: Wed, 6 Apr 2011 20:06:51 +0200
From: Marcus Meissner <meissner@...e.de>

Subject: Moonlight release 2.4.1 with security fixes

Hi,

The Novell Mono developers are just releasing Moonlight (the Mono
Silverlight equivalent) security updates for several critical issues.

The first 3 issues were reported to the Mono team by Jeroen Frijters
(<http://www.ikvm.net/>).

The fixed versions is 2.4.1 for the 2.4 branch and 3.99.3 for the 3.99
(Moonlight 4 preview) branch.

The main Novell tracker bug for this update:
<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=667077>

CVE-2011-0989: modification of read-only values via
RuntimeHelpers.InitializeArray
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/035c8587c0d8d307e45f1b7171a0d337bb451f1e>

The modification of read-only variables (e.g. from outside the sandbox)
could be used for breaking out of the moonlight sandboxing.

CVE-2011-0990: buffer overflow due to race condition in in Array.FastCopy
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/2f00e4bbb2137130845afb1b2a1e678552fc8e5c>

Similar to the above, an array element could be changed to a privileged
read-only element which would then be overwritten.
(So not a lowlevel buffer overflow, but a sandboxing violation/break out.)

CVE-2011-0991: use-after-free due to DynamicMethod resurrection
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/8eb1189099e02372fd45ca1c67230eccf1edddc0>
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/89d1455a80ef13cddee5d79ec00c06055da3085c>

Also fixed in this update:
CVE-2011-0992: information leak due to improper thread finalization
<https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=678515>
<https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/722f9890f09aadfc37ae479e7d946d5fc5ef7b91>

Ciao, Marcus

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

```
	* reflection.c: Use a reference queue to cleanup
	dynamic methods instead of finalization.

	* runtime.c: Shutdown the dynamic method queue
	before runtime cleanup begins.

	* DynamicMethod.cs: No longer finalizable.

	* icall-def.h: Remove unused dynamic method icall.

	Fixes #660422
