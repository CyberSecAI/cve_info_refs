How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# language-selector 0.6.7 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
language-selector (0.6.7) maverick-security; urgency=low

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * SECURITY UPDATE: language selector backend did not verify policy kit
    authentication.
    - debian/language-selector-common.postinst: shut down old backend.
    - CVE-2011-0729

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * dbus_backend/ls-dbus-backend: Actually look at the PolicyKit check result
    and only proceed if it succeeded. Thanks to Romain Perier for finding this
    and providing the patch! This fixes a local root privilege escalation, as
    this allows any authenticated user to write arbitrary shell commands into
    /etc/default/locale. (LP: [#764397](/bugs/764397))
  * dbus_backend/ls-dbus-backend: Reject locale names with invalid characters
    in it, to further prevent injecting shell code into /etc/default/locale
    for authenticated users. Thanks to Felix Geyer for the initial patch!
    (LP: [#764397](/bugs/764397))
  * debian/control: Update Vcs-Bzr: for newly created maverick branch.

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: language-selector

Hello,

The actual polkit authentification in the language-selector dbus backend can be easily bypassed.

Steps to reproduce:

1) download ls-dbus-polkit-bypass.py

2) from a terminal ./ls-dbus-polkit-bypass.py de\_DE.UTF-8

3) when the polkit agent ask you the password just click "cancel"

3) log you from tty1

4) exec "locale"

LANG has been changed anyway, it should don't... (a root function has been executed bypassing system policy)

Also, SetSystemDefaultLanguageEnv and SetSystemDefaultLangEnv do not check input arguments, so we can perform code injection in root !

ProblemType: Bug

DistroRelease: Ubuntu 11.04

Package: language-selector (not installed)

A possible fix for the code injection would be : check if sysLang and sysLanguage are found in the language list (see "data" directory), if they are not found the method could throw an error...

This affects maverick and natty. language-selector in <= lucid doesn't use policykit.

I don't think it's easily possible to verify if the language is installed on the system (for example LANGUAGE can contain multiple ":" seperated languages).

Instead it should only make sure that one cannot inject shell commands.

This regex should do that: ^[\w\.\-@:]+$

To test the patch you can call:

dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=com.ubuntu.LanguageSelector / com.ubuntu.LanguageSelector.SetSystemDefaultLanguageEnv string:"abc\" EVIL\_COMMAND && true \"xyz"

The old version writes LANGUAGE="abc" EVIL\_COMMAND && true "xyz" to /etc/default/locale even when canceling the auth dialog.

The patched one always returns false.

Thanks for the patch! I confirm that these are the only two places where this is used.

Security team, do you want a coordinated disclosure for this once the maverick and natty patches are ready, or can we fix this in natty now and make this bug public?

I also updated Felix' patch a bit and applied it as well.

Both fixes are sitting in the natty bzr branch on my local machine now, but I didn't push yet as this bug is still private.

@Martin, I can push this for Maverick today. Could you attach your updated patch for Maverick?

Also, I assume this only affects Ubuntu, and doesn't need coordination with any other distro?

This is the maverick debdiff.

Some downstream derivatives of Ubuntu might use that (Mint, etc.?). Debian, Fedora, SUSE don't use it.

Jamie said that we should wait with this until Kees assigns a CVE, as it's originating from Ubuntu.

# language-selector 0.6.7 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
language-selector (0.6.7) maverick-security; urgency=low

  [ Kees Cook ]
  * SECURITY UPDATE: language selector backend did not verify policy kit
    authentication.
    - debian/language-selector-common.postinst: shut down old backend.
    - CVE-2011-0729

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * dbus_backend/ls-dbus-backend: Actually look at the PolicyKit check result
    and only proceed if it succeeded. Thanks to Romain Perier for finding this
    and providing the patch! This fixes a local root privilege escalation, as
    this allows any authenticated user to write arbitrary shell commands into
    /etc/default/locale. (LP: [#764397](/bugs/764397))
  * dbus_backend/ls-dbus-backend: Reject locale names with invalid characters
    in it, to further prevent injecting shell code into /etc/default/locale
    for authenticated users. Thanks to Felix Geyer for the initial patch!
    (LP: [#764397](/bugs/764397))
  * debian/control: Update Vcs-Bzr: for newly created maverick branch.

# USN-1115-1: language-selector vulnerability

19 April 2011

Local users could gain root access via the language-selector.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.10](/security/notices?release=maverick)

## Packages

* [language-selector](/security/cves?package=language-selector) - Language selector for Ubuntu Linux

## Details

Romain Perier discovered that the language-selector D-Bus backend did not

correctly check for Policy Kit authorizations. A local attacker could exploit

this to inject shell commands into the system-wide locale configuration file,

leading to root privilege escalation.
