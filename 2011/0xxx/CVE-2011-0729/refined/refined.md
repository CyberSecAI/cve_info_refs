          "details": [
            "The `language-selector` package in Ubuntu was vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to improper PolicyKit authentication checks in the D-Bus backend. Specifically, it did not properly verify if the user was authorized to change system-wide locale settings. This allowed any authenticated user to write arbitrary shell commands into /etc/default/locale, which would then be executed with root privileges. Additionally, locale names were not validated which could allow shell code injection.",

This allowed unauthorized users to change system locale settings, which requires root privileges. Additionally, the input arguments for `SetSystemDefaultLanguageEnv` and `SetSystemDefaultLangEnv` were not validated, allowing for code injection.",

This allowed local users to bypass authentication and inject shell commands into the system-wide locale configuration file, leading to root privilege escalation. Additionally, locale names were not validated, allowing further code injection possibilities. The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the PolicyKit check result was properly evaluated and by validating locale input to prevent shell code injection."
