Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2011-0092:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how Microsoft Visio validates objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Visio files. Specifically, the application will access the vtable of an object that hasn't been completely initialized yet while handling a malformed stream, leading to an exception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption due to improper handling of objects during file parsing, specifically malformed streams of VisioDocument, leading to accessing an uninitialized vtable.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** Visio fails to properly validate the structure of objects in the Visio files, enabling the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system with the privileges of the logged-on user.
*   **Complete System Control:** If the user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the system, including installing programs, modifying/deleting data, or creating new accounts.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could view, change, or delete data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Visio Files:** Exploitation requires the victim to open a specially crafted Visio file.
*   **Email Attachments:** Attackers can send the crafted file as an email attachment, tricking the user into opening it.
*   **Web-based Attacks:** Attackers can host a website with a malicious Visio file, attempting to lure users into downloading and opening the file or compromise websites to host malicious Visio files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted Malicious File:** Attackers must create a specially crafted Visio file to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** Attackers must convince a user to open the malicious Visio file (through email or website interaction).
*   **No Network Access Required** - vulnerability is triggered on the user's machine, not a network service.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the way Visio handles parsing the VisioDocument stream. Upon handling a malformed stream, the application will raise an exception. While handling this exception, the application will access the vtable of an object that hasn't been completely initialized yet.
*   The vulnerability is specifically tied to how Microsoft Visio handles LZW stream decompression.
*   The vulnerability is present in Microsoft Visio 2002 SP2, 2003 SP3, and 2007 SP2.
*   A workaround involves restricting access to `ORMELEMS.DLL`, but this disables database modeling in Visio.
*   Disabling Visio add-ins can also act as a workaround.

**Mitigating Factors:**

*   Users with fewer user rights on the system are less impacted than users with administrative rights.
*   The vulnerability cannot be automatically exploited through e-mail.
*   In a Web-based attack, the attacker must convince the user to visit the malicious website.
