{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the insufficient filtering of the EXEC_CMD command within the Hewlett-Packard Data Protector client. Specifically, the client only verifies the filenames of the scripts being executed but not their content.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient input validation, specifically regarding the contents of script files. The program trusts the content of the script files only based on filename.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the vulnerable system under the context of the current user.",
  "Attack vectors": "A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying malicious code within specific script files.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to send commands to the vulnerable Data Protector client."
