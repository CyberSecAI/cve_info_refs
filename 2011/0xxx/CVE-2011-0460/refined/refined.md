Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0460:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `kbd` init script writes a file to `/dev/shm` during system shutdown.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Handling:** The script writes to a location where local users have the ability to create symbolic links. This allows for a symlink attack.
- **Race Condition (Implied):** The vulnerability exists during shutdown, indicating a potential race condition. A malicious user could create a symlink in `/dev/shm` after the script starts writing, and before the file is actually written.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Corruption:** A local user can create a symbolic link to an arbitrary file on the filesystem. When the `kbd` script attempts to write to the file in `/dev/shm`, the write operation will be redirected to the arbitrary location specified by the symlink. This allows the malicious user to corrupt arbitrary files on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack requires a local user to have the ability to create symlinks in `/dev/shm`.
- **Timing:** Exploitation needs to occur during system shutdown

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a local user with the ability to create symlinks within the `/dev/shm` directory.
- The attacker needs to be able to create the symlink in `/dev/shm` before the shutdown script writes to the file in `/dev/shm`. This indicates a potential race condition exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content is consistent with the CVE description, and it provides more details.
- The vulnerability is classified as "moderate".
- The fix involves updating the `kbd` package to version 1.14.1-31.3.1 for openSUSE 11.3 and 1.14.1-20.5.1 for openSUSE 11.2
