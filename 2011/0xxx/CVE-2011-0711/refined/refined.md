{
  "CVE-2011-0711": {
    "Description": "The FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl (and its compat equivalent) calls out to xfs_fs_geometry() with a version number of 3. This code path does not fill in the logsunit member of the passed xfs_fsop_geom_t, leading to the leaking of four bytes of uninitialized stack data to potentially unprivileged callers.",
    "Root cause": "Missing initialization of the 'logsunit' member of the xfs_fsop_geom_t structure in the xfs_fs_geometry() function when called with version 3 via the FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Leak",
      "Uninitialized Memory"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local, potentially unprivileged user can read uninitialized stack memory, specifically four bytes of the stack.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl, which leads to the vulnerable code path in the XFS filesystem code.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "A local, potentially unprivileged user is required to call the FSGEOMETRY_V1 ioctl."
