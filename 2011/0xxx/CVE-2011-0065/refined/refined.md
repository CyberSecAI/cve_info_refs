Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error in how Firefox handles the `mChannel` member of `OBJECT` elements. Specifically, the `OnChannelRedirect` method could be called when an `OBJECT` element doesn't have an `mChannel` assigned. This allows an attacker to set an arbitrary object as the channel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: After setting a nearly arbitrary object as `mChannel`, the original object is not properly managed, leading to a dangling pointer after garbage collection. This dangling pointer is later dereferenced by `LoadObject` method, when the OBJECT's "data" attribute is set, leading to memory corruption.
- Weak reference: The `mChannel` was a weak reference and was not managed correctly, resulting in a dangling pointer after garbage collection.
- Insufficient validation in `OnChannelRedirect`: The method lacks a null check for `mChannel` before using it, and no check is performed for the type of the object being assigned as a channel.
-  The vulnerability existed due to allowing untrusted content to call the `OnChannelRedirect` method and to interact with nsIChannelEventSink interface of an OBJECT element.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By exploiting this use-after-free, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the user running the browser. The attacker can use a heap spray to overwrite the dangling pointer and control the execution flow.
- Remote exploitation: The vulnerability is exploitable remotely by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page containing a crafted `OBJECT` element.
- The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious web page: An attacker crafts a malicious web page that contains a vulnerable `OBJECT` element.
- User interaction: The victim must visit the malicious page to trigger the vulnerability.
- Manipulation of OBJECT element: The attacker utilizes the `OBJECT` element's "data" attribute and interaction with the `OnChannelRedirect` method to trigger the use-after-free.
- Heap spray: An attacker can overwrite a dangling pointer via a heap spray and gain code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and host a malicious web page or deliver a malicious file.
- Knowledge of the vulnerability details to construct the malicious `OBJECT` element.
- Ability to execute JavaScript code in the user's browser

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified by ZDI-CAN-1032.
- CVSS score: 9 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
- The issue affects Firefox versions prior to 3.6.16 and 3.5.19.
- The vulnerability is similar to CVE-2011-0066, which concerns a use-after-free in `mObserverList`.

The provided content also includes details on how the vulnerability was fixed, including backporting the fix to different branches and versions. It highlights the use of a null check in `OnChannelRedirect` as an immediate fix and discusses the longer-term need to restrict content's access to the relevant interfaces.
