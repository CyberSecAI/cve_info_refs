The following was reported to security@mozilla.org by ZDI:
ZDI-CAN-1033: Mozilla Firefox OBJECT mObserverList Remote Code Execution Vulnerabililty
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
The specific flaw exists within Firefox's handling of observer OBJECTs. If an observer OBJECT is removed from the mObserverList during an iteration of LOOP\_OVER\_OBSERVERS macro, one can heap spray over |mObserverList.mNext| and change the execution flow. This would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.
Version(s) tested: Firefox 3.6.13
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3
As the OBJECT element implements nsIImageLoadingContent interface it is possible to register custom observer (implementing imgIDecoderObserver) and force our OBJECT removal during e.g. onStartContainer| callback (other hooks are probably dangerous as well). That would also destroy object's observers linked list, |mObserverList|. If that happens during iteration of LOOP\_OVER\_OBSERVERS macro one can heap spray over |mObserverList.mNext| and change the execution flow.
From content/base/src/nsObjectLoadingContent.cpp:
// Macro to call some func on each observer. This handles observers
// removing themselves.
#define LOOP\_OVER\_OBSERVERS(func\_)
\
PR\_BEGIN\_MACRO
\
for (ImageObserver\* observer = &mObserverList, \*next; observer;
\
observer = next) {
\
next = observer->mNext;
\
if (observer->mObserver) {
\
observer->mObserver->func\_;
\
}
\
}
\
PR\_END\_MACRO

This looks like it's saying "a Firefox extension could do something critically bad by implementing imgIDecoderObserver". That's not a security flaw in itself.

Looks like on 3.6 untrusted content can call addObserver. We don't allow that on trunk.

On trunk this was fixed in [bug 604262](/show_bug.cgi?id=604262 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsImageLoadingContent::OnStartDecode]"). We should probably just backport that patch.

To be clear, if you're using the attached testcase, the build is unaffected if opening the testcase shows an exception in the error console. If there is no exception, then the build has this bug.

I believe he ran the testcase from [bug 604262](/show_bug.cgi?id=604262 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsImageLoadingContent::OnStartDecode]") in Firefox 3.5 and didn't see the crash. Was that an incorrect verification?

Yes. The testcase in that bug doesn't crash in Firefox 3.6 either, for whatever reason, whereas this bug is clearly present in 3.6, right?

I checked the testcase in [bug 604262](/show_bug.cgi?id=604262 "VERIFIED FIXED - Crash [@ nsImageLoadingContent::OnStartDecode]") as Brandon asked me to do in triage today since I had a 1.9.1 system running at the moment. If that is wrong, we can change the 1.9.1 status. I didn't even look at 1.9.2 since we were in triage and wondering about 1.9.1.

Last Revised: February 5, 2013

Number: ASA-2011-194

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 3.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could possibly lead to arbitrary code
execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0080](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0080.html) and
[CVE-2011-0081](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0081.html) to these issues.

An arbitrary memory write flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
out-of-memory conditions. If all memory was consumed when a user visited a
malicious web page, it could possibly lead to arbitrary code execution
with the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0078](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0078.html) to this issue.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML
frameset tag. A web page with a frameset tag containing large values for
the "rows" and "cols" attributes could trigger this flaw, possibly leading
to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0077](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0077.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the HTML iframe tag. A web page
with an iframe tag containing a specially-crafted source address could
trigger this flaw, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0075](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0075.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed multiple marquee elements. A
malformed HTML document could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0074](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0074.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled the nsTreeSelection element.
Malformed content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0073](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0073.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox appended frame and
iframe elements to a DOM tree when the NoScript add-on was enabled.
Malicious HTML content could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0072](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0072.html) to this issue.

A directory traversal flaw was found in the Firefox resource:// protocol
handler. Malicious content could cause Firefox to access arbitrary files
accessible to the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0071](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0071.html) to this issue.

A double free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled
"application/http-index-format" documents. A malformed HTTP response could
cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0070](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0070.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled certain JavaScript cross-domain
requests. If malicious content generated a large number of cross-domain
JavaScript requests, it could cause Firefox to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0069](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0069.html) to this issue.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox displayed the autocomplete pop-up.
Malicious content could use this flaw to steal form history information.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-0067](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0067.html) to this issue.

Two use-after-free flaws were found in the Firefox mObserverList and
mChannel objects. Malicious content could use these flaws to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2011-0066](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0066.html) and
[CVE-2011-0065](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0065.html) to these issues.

A flaw was found in the Firefox XSLT generate-id() function. This function
returned the memory address of an object in memory, which could possibly be
used by attackers to bypass address randomization protections.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name
[CVE-2011-1202](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-1202.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | Avaya Communication Server 1000: * CS1000E * CS1000M * CS1000E/CS1000M Signaling Server | All | None | See mitigating factors below. | Avaya IQ | 5.x | None | See mitigating factors below. || Avaya Message Networking | 3.1, 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0.x, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | Low | Upgrade to 6.1.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.2 or later. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.2.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x, 6.2.x | Low | Upgrade to 6.3 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0065 CVE-2011-0066 CVE-2011-0067 CVE-2011-0069 CVE-2011-0070 CVE-2011-0071 CVE-2011-0072 CVE-2011-0073 CVE-2011-0074 CVE-2011-0075 CVE-2011-0077 CVE-2011-0078 CVE-2011-0080 CVE-2011-0081 CVE-2011-1202 | This rated a Low for IQ, MN, MSS, PS, SMGR because no critical system processes or applications are affected This is rated a None for CS1000 and IQ because XULRunner is not used or configured and Firefox is not installed |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

The following was sent to security@mozilla.org today:
ZDI-CAN-1032: Mozilla Firefox OBJECT mChannel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
-- CVSS ----------------------------------------------------------------
9, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:C)
-- ABSTRACT ------------------------------------------------------------
TippingPoint has identified a vulnerability affecting the following products:
Mozilla Firefox
-- VULNERABILITY DETAILS -----------------------------------------------
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Mozilla Firefox. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page.
The specific flaw exists within the OnChannelRedirect method. When an OBJECT element has no mChannel assigned, it is possible to call the |OnChannelRedirect| method, setting a nearly arbitrary object as the channel in use. |mChannel| will become a dangling pointer, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the user running the browser.
Version(s) tested: Firefox 3.6.13
Platform(s) tested: Windows XP SP3
From content/base/src/nsObjectLoadingContent.cpp:
nsObjectLoadingContent::OnChannelRedirect(nsIChannel \*aOldChannel,
nsIChannel \*aNewChannel,
PRUint32 aFlags)
{
// If we're already busy with a new load, cancel the redirect
if (aOldChannel != mChannel) {
return NS\_BINDING\_ABORTED;
}
if (mClassifier) {
mClassifier->OnRedirect(aOldChannel, aNewChannel);
}
mChannel = aNewChannel;
return NS\_OK;
}
When an OBJECT element (implementation of nsIChannelEventSink interface) has no |mChannel| assigned, it is possible to call the |OnChannelRedirect| method, setting a nearly arbitrary object as the channel in use. The problem is that |mChannel| is a weak reference (as defined in content/base/src/nsObjectLoadingContent.h) and will become a dangling pointer after the garbage collection cycle.
The dangling pointer can be utilized by setting the "data" attribute to our OBJECT. This will call the |LoadObject| method, and load our OBJECT.
nsObjectLoadingContent::LoadObject(nsIURI\* aURI,
PRBool aNotify,
const nsCString& aTypeHint,
PRBool aForceLoad)
{
...
if (mChannel) {
...
mChannel->Cancel(NS\_BINDING\_ABORTED);
...
}
...
}

This is basically the same as [bug 634983](/show_bug.cgi?id=634983 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use-after-free vulnerability in OBJECT's mObserverList (ZDI-CAN-1033)"). Content shouldn't be able to QI the <object> to these random interfaces. And on trunk it can't. We need to backport that change to branch.Depends on: [CVE-2011-0066](/show_bug.cgi?id=634983 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use-after-free vulnerability in OBJECT's mObserverList (ZDI-CAN-1033)")

Actually, wait. We just renamed the redirect function. I can call asyncOnChannelRedirect from untrusted script fine on trunk....
I guess this is simple enough to fix by null-checking mChannel, though.

Fwiw, I don't think 2.0 is unaffected. It just needs a slightly different testcase to trigger.
I'll put up a patch tomorrow; I need to spend some time auditing the other stuff <object> and company implement.Assignee: nobody → bzbarsky

What does "confirmed critical" mean? We don't have a testcase which does an actual heap-smashing attack, but it is easy for content to trigger use-after-free, which pretty much guarantees that it can be weaponized.

Sorry for the lag here; I did do the audit last week, and this plus the image loading content stuff from [bug 634983](/show_bug.cgi?id=634983 "RESOLVED FIXED - Use-after-free vulnerability in OBJECT's mObserverList (ZDI-CAN-1033)") seem to be the only issues.

Oh, and the long-term-correct fix is to stop allowing untrusted content to access this interface, but the upcoming patch will fix things for now.

This applies to both branches with only a bit of fuzz.
The other option is to implement the channel redirect listener on a non-scriptable helper object instead of on the element itself. jst, let me know if you'd prefer that?

I think this'll do for now, until we have bindings that lets us selectively expose stuff only where we intend to expose stuff...

The "3.6.15" we're releasing today does not fix this bug, the release containing this bug fix has been renamed to "3.6.16" and the bugzilla flags will be updated to reflect that soon. Today's release is a re-release of 3.6.14 plus a fix for a bug that prevented many Java applets from starting up.

CVE-2011-0067

   Paul Stone discovered that Java applets could steal information
   from the autocompletion history.

CVE-2011-0071

   Soroush Dalili discovered a directory traversal vulnerability in
   handling resource URIs.

As indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for
the Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end
of the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different
mail client.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze2.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.
