Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0462:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the login page of the openSUSE Build Service (OBS) web user interface (webui).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The login page of the OBS web interface was susceptible to XSS attacks. This means that malicious scripts could be injected into the login page and executed by users when they access the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session when the user visits the login page. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking (stealing the user's session cookie)
    - Defacement of the login page
    - Phishing attacks by redirecting the user to a malicious page
    - Other malicious actions, depending on the context and the capabilities of the web application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the OBS webui's login page.
- An attacker would need to inject malicious code into a field or parameter of the login page that is not properly sanitized before being rendered by the web browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the login page's input. This may involve injecting code directly in a query parameter or finding other injection points in the web application where user-supplied data could reach the login page and be rendered without proper sanitization.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be an authenticated user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in OBS version 2.1.6.
- The fix is specifically mentioned as "Fix possible XSS attack vectors in login page".
- Full XSS protection in all web UI interfaces was planned for OBS 2.3.
- The issue was reported by Dean Pierce from Intel.
