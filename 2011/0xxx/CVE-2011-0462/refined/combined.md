# Build Service team releases new versions fixing security problems

The openSUSE Build Service team has released verison 2.0.8 and 2.1.6. of OBS. Both versions are fixing a critical security leak which can be miss-used to modify projects or packages without having write permission there. We highly recommend to update your instance of OBS as soon as possible to these new versions. Version 1.7 is not affected by this issue.

*Thanks to Marcus HÃ¼we for reporting this issue.*

## Details on OBS 2.1.6

OBS 2.1.6 is also fixing security issues in LDAP mode and a possible crossite scripting attack vector on the login screen (full XSS protection in all webui interfaces will be part of OBS 2.3). *Thanks to Dean Pierce from Intel for discussing these issues and possible solutions with us.*

Version 2.1.6 can be downloaded as usual from gitorious, openSUSE:Tools (or openSUSE:Tool:2.0 for version 2.0.8) project repositories or as [appliance for testing and production systems](//en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3ABuild_Service_Appliance).

OBS 2.1.6 contains several further changes, please read the release notes below.
