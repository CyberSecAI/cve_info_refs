  "cveId": "CVE-2011-0788",
  "related": true,
  "info": "The vulnerability is related to an unspecified issue in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) component of Oracle Java SE 6 Update 25 and earlier, specifically when running on Windows. It allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Deployment. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0786.\n\nRoot cause of vulnerability: Unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component of Java Runtime Environment (JRE). \n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities: The vulnerability lies within the Deployment component, allowing for potential bypass of security restrictions by remote, untrusted applets and applications.\n\nImpact of exploitation: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system. An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, modify system data, or cause a denial of service.\n\nAttack vectors: The primary attack vector is through malicious Java Web Start applications or Java applets. The attack is performed remotely.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to host a malicious Java applet or Java Web Start application and trick a user into running this. The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.",
