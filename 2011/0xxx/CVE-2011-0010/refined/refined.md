  "CVE-2011-0010": {
    "description": "A flaw exists in sudo's password checking logic that allows a user to run a command with only the group changed without being prompted for a password.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check in sudo's password checking logic. When the 'runas group' support was added, the logic was not updated to take the target group into account. This caused sudo to skip the password check when the target user is the same as the invoking user, but the invoking user is not a member of the target group.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect authorization check",
      "Missing password prompt"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the specified group if sudo was configured to allow the attacker to use a program as this group. It affects user authentication, allowing a user to run a command with only the group changed without being prompted for a password.",
      "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access",
	    "Utilizing sudo command with '-g' option to change the group"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
	 "Must have access to run sudo commands",
     "Sudoers configuration must have a Runas group specified"
    ],
       "affected_versions": [
      "Sudo 1.7.0 through 1.7.4p4"
    ],
    "fix_versions": [
      "Sudo 1.7.4p5 and later"
    ],
	"additional_details": "This vulnerability is present when a sudoers entry contains both a Runas user and a Runas group. A configuration with only a Runas user is not affected"
  }
