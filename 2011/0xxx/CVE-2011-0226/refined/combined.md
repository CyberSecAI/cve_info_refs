Vulnerability  : missing input sanisiting
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0226

What do you know about this one: CVE-2011-1908?

Nothing.

I don't know.  Nobody has contacted me recently.  Some months ago,
people from Foxit have sent a bunch of problems which I've tried to
fix in the git repository (thus all related patches are in version
2.4.5).

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

I've applied the fix below, rejecting negative arguments to
`callothersubr'.  This corrects the valgrind errors.  If you think
that this is a critical issue (this is, if the exploit is repeatable
with FreeType 2.4.5 and my patch fixes this), I'll release 2.4.6 as
soon as possible.

Please test and comment.

## [ft-devel] details on iPhone exploit caused by FreeType?

```

Folks,

has anyone more information on the recent exploit for the iPhone,
reportedly caused by a problem within FreeType's
`t1_decoder_parse_charstrings'?  Extracting the buggy font from

  <http://www.jailbreakme.com/saffron/_/iPod_4.3.3_8J2.pdf>

and testing the current ftview (from the git repository, but rather
the same as with version 2.4.5) with valgrind on my GNU/Linux box, I
get a bunch of

  Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s)

but nothing else (and I'll fix these problems in due course).

I must admit that I'm rather poor at understanding such exploits, but
AFAIK, a conditional jump can't be abused for executing arbitrary
code, right?  Please correct me if I'm wrong.

    Werner

```

  Description: An issue existed in the handling of XML external entities in jabberd2, a server for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). jabberd2 expands external entities in incoming requests. This allows an attacker to consume system resources very quickly, denying service to legitimate users of the server. This update addresses the issue by disabling entity expansion in incoming requests.

  CVE-ID

**Hackers have once again released a "jailbreak" for iOS devices that can be completed through the Mobile Safari Web browser, taking advantage of an exploit found in the operating system's PDF reader.**

The hack can be accomplished by visiting the website [jailbreakme.com](https://www.jailbreakme.com//) on an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. It is compatible with all of Apple's current iOS-powered mobile devices, including the iPad 2 and iPhone 4.

The hack was developed by "comex," Grant "chpwn" Paul and Jay "saurik" Freeman, and is compatible with iOS 4.3 through 4.3.3 on all iPads, the iPhone 3GS, GSM iPhone 4, and third- and fourth-generation iPod touch. It also works with iOS 4.2.6 through 4.2.8 for the CDMA iPhone 4.

The official site tells visitors they can jailbreak their iOS device to experience the software "fully customizable, themeable, and with every tweak you could possibly imagine." Jailbreaking is the term used to describe hacking iOS to allow users to install custom software and tweaks not approved by Apple.

The site also refers to jailbreaking as "safe and completely reversible," as users can restore their iPhone or iPad to the original, unaltered iOS software by restoring with iTunes. But jailbreaking is also a warranty-voiding process that Apple has warned users carries [security risks](https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/04/20/apple_warns_iphone_os_users_of_jailbreaking_risks.html). In 2009, a [worm spread](https://appleinsider.com/articles/09/11/09/first_known_iphone_worm_rickrolls_jailbroken_apple_handsets.html) only on jailbroken iPhones that had enabled SSH for file transfer and did not change the default password.

Last July, the U.S. government affirmed that the process of jailbreaking is [considered legal](https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/07/26/us_government_legalizes_iphone_jailbreaking_for_unauthorized_apps.html), though Apple is under no obligation to support users who have issues with hacked software.

The new "jailbreakme" site also asks users: "Please don't use this for piracy." While software can be legally downloaded or even sold through the jailbreak-only "Cydia" store, jailbreaking can also be used to [pirate software](https://appleinsider.com/articles/09/03/09/jailbreak_stores_plot_to_plunder_iphone_app_revenue.html) that is sold on Apple's App Store.

This week's new jailbreak method is the second time hackers have exploited a PDF-related security hole in the Mobile Safari browser. The previous hack, issued [last August](https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/08/03/browser_based_ios_jailbreak_utilizes_scary_pdf_security_hole.html), relied on a corrupt font to crash Safari's Compact Font Format handler.

Ironically, hackers who exploited the PDF security hole in iOS last year also delivered their own [security fix](https://appleinsider.com/articles/10/08/13/hackers_patch_pdf_exploit_on_older_jailbroken_ios_devices.html) to address the very same issue on jailbroken devices. The patch aimed to ensure that dishonest hackers would not be able to utilize the exploit for malicious purposes.
