# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-003 - Critical

## Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2482017)

Published: February 08, 2011 | Updated: March 08, 2011

**Version:** 2.0

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves two privately reported vulnerabilities and two publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer or if a user opens a legitimate HTML file that loads a specially crafted library file. An attacker who successfully exploited any of these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

This security update is rated Critical for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows clients; and Moderate for Internet Explorer 6, Internet Explorer 7, and Internet Explorer 8 on Windows servers. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory, handles Cascading Style Sheets, and loads external libraries. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

This security update also addresses the vulnerability first described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2488013](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2488013).

**Recommendation.** The majority of customers have automatic updating enabled and will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update immediately using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** None

## CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3971

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses memory while importing a Cascading Style Sheet that refers to itself recursively. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2010-3971](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3971).

#### Mitigating Factors for CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3971

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to persuade users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.
* By default, all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Outlook Express, and Windows Mail open HTML e-mail messages in the Restricted sites zone, which disables script and ActiveX controls, removing the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code. If a user clicks a link in an e-mail message, the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the Web-based attack scenario.
* By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). This mode mitigates this vulnerability. See the FAQ section of this security update for more information about Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration.

#### Workarounds for CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3971

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Read e-mails in plain text**

  To help protect yourself from the e-mail attack vector, read e-mail messages in plain text format.

  Microsoft Office Outlook 2002 users who have applied Office XP Service Pack 1 or a later version and Microsoft Office Outlook Express 6 users who have applied Internet Explorer 6 Service Pack 1 or a later version can enable this setting and view e-mail messages that are not digitally signed or e-mail messages that are not encrypted in plain text only.

  Digitally signed e-mail messages or encrypted e-mail messages are not affected by the setting and may be read in their original formats. For more information about how to enable this setting in Outlook 2002, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 307594](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/307594).

  For information about this setting in Outlook Express 6, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 291387](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/291387).

  **Impact of workaround.** E-mail messages that are viewed in plain text format will not contain pictures, specialized fonts, animations, or other rich content. Additionally:

  + The changes are applied to the preview pane and to open messages.
  + Pictures become attachments so that they are not lost.
  + Because the message is still in Rich Text or HTML format in the store, the object model (custom code solutions) may behave unexpectedly.
* **Set Internet and Local intranet security zone settings to "High" to block ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting in these zones**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings for the Internet security zone to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting. You can do this by setting your browser security to High.

  To raise the browsing security level in Internet Explorer, perform the following steps:

  1. On the Internet Explorer **Tools** menu, click **Internet Options**.
  2. In the **Internet Options** dialog box, click the **Security** tab, and then click the **Internet** icon.
  3. Under **Security level for this zone**, move the slider to **High**. This sets the security level for all Web sites you visit to High.

  **Note** If no slider is visible, click **Default Level**, and then move the slider to **High**.

  **Note** Setting the level to High may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly even with the security setting set to High.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking ActiveX Controls and Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use ActiveX or Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use ActiveX Controls to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Blocking ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. If you do not want to block ActiveX Controls or Active Scripting for such sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to block ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect yourself from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.
* **Prevent the recursive loading of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) in Internet Explorer**

  This workaround helps to prevent exploitation of the vulnerability by blocking the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) attack vector in Internet Explorer.

  This workaround is only available as a **Microsoft Fix it** solution. See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2482017](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2482017) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to enable or disable this workaround.

  **Note** Customers of Internet Explorer who have not already applied the [MS10-090](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=206495) update must also apply the MS10-090 update before enabling this workaround.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to blocking the recursive loading of a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). Users may encounter some slight performance issues due to the increased checking that is required to block the loading of the CSS files.

  **Note** On systems where this workaround is enabled, Microsoft recommends that the workaround be disabled before applying this security update.

#### FAQ for CSS Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2010-3971

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer does not properly handle memory when parsing a specially crafted Cascading Style Sheet that refers to itself recursively.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles Cascading Style Sheets.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2010-3971](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-3971). This vulnerability was described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2488013](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2488013).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

Yes. Microsoft is aware of limited attacks attempting to exploit the vulnerability.

## Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0035

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer accesses an object that has not been correctly initialized or has been deleted. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted Web page. When a user views the Web page, the vulnerability could allow remote code execution. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0035](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0035).

#### Mitigating Factors for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0035

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites.

* **Configure Internet Explorer to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to prompt before running Active Scripting or to disable Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zone. To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Internet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  6. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Active Scripting**, click \*\*Prompt \*\*or **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  7. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Disabling Active Scripting in the Internet and Local intranet security zones may cause some Web sites to work incorrectly. If you have difficulty using a Web site after you change this setting, and you are sure the site is safe to use, you can add that site to your list of trusted sites. This will allow the site to work correctly.

  **Impact of workaround.** There are side effects to prompting before running Active Scripting. Many Web sites that are on the Internet or on an intranet use Active Scripting to provide additional functionality. For example, an online e-commerce site or banking site may use Active Scripting to provide menus, ordering forms, or even account statements. Prompting before running Active Scripting is a global setting that affects all Internet and intranet sites. You will be prompted frequently when you enable this workaround. For each prompt, if you feel you trust the site that you are visiting, click **Yes** to run Active Scripting. If you do not want to be prompted for all these sites, use the steps outlined in "Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone".

  **Add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone**

  After you set Internet Explorer to require a prompt before it runs ActiveX controls and Active Scripting in the Internet zone and in the Local intranet zone, you can add sites that you trust to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone. This will allow you to continue to use trusted Web sites exactly as you do today, while helping to protect you from this attack on untrusted sites. We recommend that you add only sites that you trust to the Trusted sites zone.

  To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer, click **Tools**, click **Internet Options**, and then click the **Security** tab.
  2. In the **Select a Web content zone to specify its current security settings** box, click **Trusted Sites**, and then click **Sites**.
  3. If you want to add sites that do not require an encrypted channel, click to clear the **Require server verification (https:) for all sites in this zone** check box.
  4. In the **Add this Web site to the zone** box, type the URL of a site that you trust, and then click **Add**.
  5. Repeat these steps for each site that you want to add to the zone.
  6. Click **OK** two times to accept the changes and return to Internet Explorer.

  **Note** Add any sites that you trust not to take malicious action on your system. Two in particular that you may want to add are **\*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com** and **\*.update.microsoft.com**. These are the sites that will host the update, and it requires an ActiveX Control to install the update.

#### FAQ for Uninitialized Memory Corruption Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0036

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer does not properly handle objects in memory when parsing specially crafted Web content.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could host a specially crafted Web site that is designed to exploit this vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the Web site. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements. These Web sites could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site. It could also be possible to display specially crafted Web content by using banner advertisements or by using other methods to deliver Web content to affected systems.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that a user be logged on and visiting a Web site for any malicious action to occur. Therefore, any systems where Internet Explorer is used frequently, such as workstations or terminal servers, are at the most risk from this vulnerability.

**I am running Internet Explorer for Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, or Windows Server 2008 R2. Does this mitigate this vulnerability?**

Yes. By default, Internet Explorer on Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2 runs in a restricted mode that is known as [Enhanced Security Configuration](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd883248%28ws.10%29.aspx). Enhanced Security Configuration is a group of preconfigured settings in Internet Explorer that can reduce the likelihood of a user or administrator downloading and running specially crafted Web content on a server. This is a mitigating factor for Web sites that you have not added to the Internet Explorer Trusted sites zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that Internet Explorer handles objects in memory.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0038

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that Internet Explorer handles the loading of DLL files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged-on user. If a user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0038](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0038).

#### Mitigating Factors for Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0038

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* The file sharing protocol, Server Message Block (SMB), is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential attack vectors for this vulnerability.
* An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the local user. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

#### Workarounds for Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0038

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.
* **Disable the WebClient service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, perform the following steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

#### FAQ for Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0038

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

Internet Explorer does not properly restrict the path used for loading external libraries.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code as the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. If a user is logged-on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take complete control of the affected system. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could convince a user to open a legitimate HyperText Markup Language (HTML) file that is located in the same directory as a specially crafted dynamic link library (DLL) file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. By default, Internet Explorer only considers the desktop to be the current directory. In order for this attack to be successful, an attacker would need the user to place both the HTML file and the specially crafted DLL on the user's desktop. An attacker would have to convince a user to change the PATH environment variable in order to exploit this issue through a UNC or WebDAV location.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a legitimate HTML file and specially crafted DLL attachments to a user, and convincing the user to place the files on the desktop and to open the HTML file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could convince a user to download and save a legitimate HTML file and specially crafted DLL on to the desktop and convince the user to open the legitimate HTML file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file and execute any code it contained. This vulnerability could not be exploited by simply browsing to a Web page, user interaction is required.

In a network attack scenario, an attacker could place a legitimate HTML file and a specially crafted DLL on a network share, such as a UNC or WebDAV location. The attacker would then have to convince the user to change the PATH environment variable to include this network share, UNC, or WebDAV location and then convince the user to open the HTML file. Then, while opening the HTML file, Internet Explorer could attempt to load the DLL file found on the search path and execute any code it contained.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability mainly affects workstations where users may be expected to open attachments from untrusted network locations. Servers could also be at risk if administrators allow users to log on to servers and to run programs. However, best practices strongly discourage allowing this.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses this vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Internet Explorer loads external libraries.

**Is this vulnerability related to Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637?**

Yes, this vulnerability is related to the class of vulnerabilities, described in [Microsoft Security Advisory 2269637](https://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2269637), that affect how applications load external libraries. This security update addresses a particular instance of this type of vulnerability.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-0038](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0038).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

#### Deployment Information

**Installing the Update**

When you install this security update, the installer checks whether one or more of the files that are being updated on your system have previously been updated by a Microsoft hotfix.

If you have previously installed a hotfix to update one of these files, the installer copies the RTMQFE, SP1QFE, or SP2QFE files to your system. Otherwise, the installer copies the RTMGDR, SP1GDR, or SP2GDR files to your system. Security updates may not contain all variations of these files. For more information about this behavior, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824994](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824994).

For more information about the installer, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 832475](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/832475).

For more information about the terminology that appears in this bulletin, such as *hotfix*, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 824684](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/824684).

This security update supports the following setup switches.

| Switch | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **/help** | Displays the command-line options. |
| Setup Modes |  |
| **/passive** | Unattended Setup mode. No user interaction is required, but installation status is displayed. If a restart is required at the end of Setup, a dialog box will be presented to the user with a timer warning that the computer will restart in 30 seconds. |
| **/quiet** | Quiet mode. This is the same as unattended mode, but no status or error messages are displayed. |
| Restart Options |  |
| **/norestart** | Does not restart when installation has completed. |
| **/forcerestart** | Restarts the computer after installation and force other applications to close at shutdown without saving open files first. |
| **/warnrestart[:x]** | Presents a dialog box with a timer warning the user that the computer will restart in *x* seconds. (The default setting is 30 seconds.) Intended for use with the **/quiet** switch or the **/passive** switch. |
| **/promptrestart** | Displays a dialog box prompting the local user to allow a restart. |
| Special Options |  |
| **/overwriteoem** | Overwrites OEM files without prompting. |
| **/nobackup** | Does not back up files needed for uninstall. |
| **/forceappsclose** | Forces other programs to close when the computer shuts down. |
| **/log:path** | Allows the redirection of installation log files. |
| **/integrate:path** | Integrates the update into the Windows source files. These files are located at the path that is specified in the switch. |
| **/extract[:path]** | Extracts files without starting the Setup program. |
| **/ER** | Enables extended error reporting. |
| **/verbose** | Enables verbose logging. During installation, creates %Windir%\CabBuild.log. This log details the files that are copied. Using this switch may cause the installation to proceed more slowly. |

**Note** You can combine these switches into one command. For backward compatibility, the security update also supports the setup switches that the earlier version of the Setup program uses. For more information about the supported installation switches, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 262841](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/262841).

**Verifying That the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start**, and then click **Search**.
  2. In the **Search Results** pane, click **All files and folders** under **Search Companion**.
  3. In the **All or part of the file name** box, type a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Search**.
  4. In the list of files, right-click a file name from the appropriate file information table, and then click **Properties**.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  5. On the **Version** tab, determine the version of the file that is installed on your system by comparing it to the version that is documented in the appropriate file information table.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
* **Registry Key Verification**

  You may also be able to verify the files that this security update has installed by reviewing the registry keys listed in the **Reference Table** in this section.

  These registry keys may not contain a complete list of installed files. Also, these registry keys may not be created correctly when an administrator or an OEM integrates or slipstreams this security update into the Windows installation source files.

## Insecure Library Loading Could Allow Remote Code Execution

Published: August 23, 2010 | Updated: May 13, 2014

**Version:** 19.0

## General Information

### Executive Summary

Microsoft is aware that research has been published detailing a remote attack vector for a class of vulnerabilities that affects how applications load external libraries.

This issue is caused by specific insecure programming practices that allow so-called "binary planting" or "DLL preloading attacks". These practices could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code in the context of the user running the vulnerable application when the user opens a file from an untrusted location.

This issue is caused by applications passing an insufficiently qualified path when loading an external library. Microsoft has issued guidance to developers in the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712), on how to correctly use the available application programming interfaces to prevent this class of vulnerability. Microsoft is also actively reaching out to third-party vendors through the Microsoft Vulnerability Research Program to inform them of the mitigations available in the operating system. Microsoft is also actively investigating which of its own applications may be affected.

In addition to this guidance, Microsoft is releasing a tool that allows system administrators to mitigate the risk of this new attack vector by altering the library loading behavior system-wide or for specific applications. This advisory describes the functionality of this tool and other actions that customers can take to help protect their systems.

**Mitigating Factors**:

* This issue only affects applications that do not load external libraries securely. Microsoft has previously published guidelines for developers in the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712), that recommend alternate methods to load libraries that are safe against these attacks.
* For an attack to be successful, a user must visit an untrusted remote file system location or WebDAV share and open a document from this location that is then loaded by a vulnerable application.
* The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the possible attack vectors for this vulnerability.

## Advisory FAQ

**Where can developers find guidance on how to avoid this issue?**

As of June 14, 2011, the update in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2533623) implements Application Programming Interface (API) enhancements in Windows to help developers correctly and securely load external libraries. Developers should follow the guidance provided in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2533623](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2533623) to take advantage of the API enhancements provided by the update.

Microsoft has also published the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712), which describes the various Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) available on Windows that allow developers to correctly and securely load external libraries.

Microsoft is working with developers through the Microsoft Vulnerability Research Program to share information with them on how to prevent this vulnerability in their products. Software vendors and ISVs that have questions on the mitigations available in Windows for this issue are invited to contact for additional mitigation information.

**What is the scope of the issue?**

Microsoft is aware of research published by a number of security researchers that describes a new remote attack vector for this known class of vulnerabilities. Applications are affected when they insufficiently qualify the path of an external library.

**What causes this threat?**

This exploit may occur when applications do not directly specify the fully qualified path to a library it intends to load. Depending on how the application is developed, Windows, instructed by the application, will search specific locations in the file system for the necessary library, and will load the file if found.

Some Application Programming Interfaces (API), such as SearchPath, use a search order that is intended for documents and not application libraries. Applications that use this API may try to load the library from the Current Working Directory (CWD), which may be controlled by an attacker. Other APIs may also lead to similar behavior, when used in specific ways described in the MSDN article, [Dynamic-Link Library Security](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff919712).

In the case of network shares, such as WebDAV or SMB, an attacker who can write to this location could upload a specially crafted library. In this scenario, the application attempts to load the specially crafted library, which can then execute arbitrary code on the client system in the security context of the logged-on user.

**What might an attacker use this vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as a logged-on user. If the user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take complete control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

In some cases, an attacker who already has access to a local folder on the system could use a DLL preloading vulnerability in a local application running with elevated privileges to elevate his access to the system.

**How could an attacker exploit this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability requires that the attacker convince the user to open a file using a vulnerable program, from a remote network location. When the application loads one of its required or optional libraries, the vulnerable application may attempt to load the library from the remote network location. If the attacker provides a specially crafted library at this location, the attacker may succeed at executing arbitrary code on the user's machine.

**What are the remote attack vectors for this vulnerability?**

This vulnerability can be exploited over network file systems such as (but not limited to) WebDAV and SMB. An attacker can offer a file for download over any such protocol. If the application used to open this file does not load external libraries securely, the user opening that file could be exposed to this vulnerability.

**Is this a security vulnerability that requires Microsoft to issue a security update?**

This vulnerability may require third-party vendors to issue a security update for their respective affected applications. As part of this security advisory, Microsoft is releasing an optional mitigation tool that helps customers address the risk of the remote attack vector through a per-application and global configuration setting.

Microsoft is also investigating whether any of its own applications are affected by DLL preloading vulnerabilities and will take appropriate action to protect its customers.

**What is a Dynamic Link Library (DLL)?**

A DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time. For example, in Windows operating systems, the Comdlg32 DLL performs common dialog box related functions. Therefore, each program can use the functionality that is contained in this DLL to implement an Open dialog box. This helps promote code reuse and efficient memory usage.

By using a DLL, a program can be modularized into separate components. For example, an accounting program may be sold by module. Each module can be loaded into the main program at run time if that module is installed. Because the modules are separate, the load time of the program is faster, and a module is only loaded when that functionality is requested.

**What is Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV)?**

Web-based Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) extends the HTTP/1.1 protocol to allow clients to publish, lock, and manage resources on the Web. Integrated into IIS, WebDAV allows clients to do the following:

* Manipulate resources in a WebDAV publishing directory on your server. For example, users who have been assigned the correct rights can copy and move files around in a WebDAV directory.
* Modify properties associated with certain resources. For example, a user can write to and retrieve a file's property information.
* Lock and unlock resources so that multiple users can read a file concurrently.
* Search the content and properties of files in a WebDAV directory.

**What is Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol?**

Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) Protocol is a Microsoft network file sharing protocol used in Microsoft Windows. For more information on SMB, see MSDN article, [Microsoft SMB Protocol and CIFS Protocol Overview](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa365233).

## Suggested Actions

* **Apply the update for affected software**

  Refer to the section, **Updates relating to Insecure Library Loading**, for available updates.
* **Apply Workarounds**

  Workarounds refer to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available. See the next section, **Workarounds**, for more information.

### Workarounds

* **Disable loading of libraries from WebDAV and remote network shares**

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to deploy a workaround tool that allows customers to disable the loading of libraries from remote network or WebDAV shares. This tool can be configured to disallow insecure loading on a per-application or a global system basis.

  Customers who are informed by their vendor of an application being vulnerable can use this tool to help protect against attempts to exploit this issue.

  **Note** See [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) to use the automated **Microsoft Fix it** solution to deploy the registry key to block loading of libraries for SMB and WebDAV shares. Note that this Fix it solution does require you to install the workaround tool also described in [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2264107](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107) first. This Fix it solution only deploys the registry key and requires the workaround tool in order to be effective. We recommend that administrators review the KB article closely prior to deploying this Fix it solution.

  \*\* \*\*
* **Disable the WebClient service**

  Disabling the WebClient service helps protect affected systems from attempts to exploit this vulnerability by blocking the most likely remote attack vector through the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) client service. After applying this workaround it is still possible for remote attackers who successfully exploit this vulnerability to cause the system to run programs located on the targeted user's computer or the Local Area Network (LAN), but users will be prompted for confirmation before opening arbitrary programs from the Internet.

  To disable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Disabled**. If the service is running, click **Stop**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.

  **Impact of workaround.** When the WebClient service is disabled, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) requests are not transmitted. In addition, any services that explicitly depend on the Web Client service will not start, and an error message will be logged in the System log. For example, WebDAV shares will be inaccessible from the client computer.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To re-enable the WebClient Service, follow these steps:

  1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type **Services.msc** and then click **OK**.
  2. Right-click **WebClient** service and select **Properties**.
  3. Change the Startup type to **Automatic**. If the service is not running, click **Start**.
  4. Click **OK** and exit the management application.
* **Block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall**

  These ports are used to initiate a connection with the affected component. Blocking TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall will help protect systems that are behind that firewall from attempts to exploit this vulnerability. Microsoft recommends that you block all unsolicited inbound communication from the Internet to help prevent attacks that may use other ports. For more information about ports, see the TechNet article, [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

  **Impact of workaround.** Several Windows services use the affected ports. Blocking connectivity to the ports may cause various applications or services to not function. Some of the applications or services that could be impacted are listed below:

  + Applications that use SMB (CIFS)
  + Applications that use mailslots or named pipes (RPC over SMB)
  + Server (File and Print Sharing)
  + Group Policy
  + Net Logon
  + Distributed File System (DFS)
  + Terminal Server Licensing
  + Print Spooler
  + Computer Browser
  + Remote Procedure Call Locator
  + Fax Service
  + Indexing Service
  + Performance Logs and Alerts
  + Systems Management Server
  + License Logging Service

  **How to undo the workaround.** Unblock TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. For more information about ports, see [TCP and UDP Port Assignments](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=21312).

### Additional Suggested Actions

* **Install updates from third-party vendors that address insecure library loading**

  Third-party vendors may release updates that address insecure library loading in their products. Microsoft recommends that customers contact their vendor if they have any questions whether or not a specific application is affected by this issue, and monitor for security updates released by these vendors.
* **Protect your PC**

  We continue to encourage customers to follow our Protect Your Computer guidance of enabling a firewall, getting software updates and installing antivirus software. For more information, see [Microsoft Safety & Security Center](https://www.microsoft.com/security/default.aspx).
* **Keep Microsoft Software Updated**

  Users running Microsoft software should apply the latest Microsoft security updates to help make sure that their computers are as protected as possible. If you are not sure whether your software is up to date, visit [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747), scan your computer for available updates, and install any high-priority updates that are offered to you. If you have automatic updating enabled and configured to provide updates for Microsoft products, the updates are delivered to you when they are released, but you should verify that they are installed.

## Other Information

MS11-003 Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (2482017)

Original Release Date: February 10, 2011

Last Revised: February 10, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-024

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Microsoft issued a security bulletin which contained security advisory MS11-003. This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer. The vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if a user views a specially crafted Web page using Internet Explorer or if a user opens a legitimate HTML file that loads a specially crafted library file. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names
[CVE-2010-3971](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3971),
[CVE-2011-0035](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0035),
[CVE-2011-0036](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0036) and
[CVE-2011-0038](http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0038) to these issues. A description of the vulnerabilities may be found at:

* <http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms11-003.mspx>

Certain Avaya products utilize Microsoft Operating Systems and may be affected by this vulnerability.

## 2. Avaya System Products:

Avaya system products include an Operating System with the product when it is delivered. The system products described below are delivered with a Microsoft Operating System. Actions to be taken with these products are also described below.
