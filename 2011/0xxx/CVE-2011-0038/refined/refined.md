  "CVE-2011-0038": {
    "status": "RELEVANT",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by Internet Explorer not properly restricting the path used for loading external libraries (DLL files).",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure library loading",
        "Insufficient path validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the logged-on user, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Convincing a user to open a malicious HTML file that is located in the same directory as a specially crafted DLL file.",
        "Email-based attacks where an attacker sends a legitimate HTML file and a malicious DLL as attachments and convinces the user to open the HTML file.",
        "Web-based attacks, convincing users to download a malicious HTML file and DLL file and then convincing the user to open the HTML file.",
         "Network-based attacks where an attacker places a legitimate HTML file and a malicious DLL on a network share (UNC or WebDAV location) and convinces the user to change the PATH environment variable to include this network share and then open the HTML file."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the user to perform actions that trigger the vulnerability, such as opening a malicious HTML file, changing the PATH environment variable, or downloading malicious files from a network share. An attacker needs a way to deliver the malicious files to the user, either via email, a website, or network share. They also need to craft a malicious DLL."
