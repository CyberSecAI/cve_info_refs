Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0656:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft PowerPoint handles PersistDirectoryEntry records within a presentation file. Specifically, when an entry points to a container with a malformed Slide record, an exception is raised during loading. Subsequently, the application attempts to use a method from this malformed object, leading to code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of exceptions during the loading of presentation files.
- Use of a method from a malformed object leading to an exploitable condition.
- Memory corruption due to reading invalid records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. This can lead to:
    - Complete control of the affected system.
    - Installation of malware.
    - Viewing, changing, or deleting data.
    - Creation of new accounts with full user rights.
    - The attacker gains the same privileges as the user running PowerPoint.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Files:** Attackers can create specially crafted PowerPoint files containing malformed PersistDirectoryEntry records.
- **Email Attachments:** These malicious files can be distributed as email attachments.
- **Web-Based Attacks:** Attackers can host these malicious files on compromised or specially crafted websites. The victim would have to be convinced to visit the website and open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PowerPoint file with a malformed record.
- The attacker needs to convince the victim to open the malicious file. This can be done through social engineering techniques, such as tricking the user into opening the file via an email or web link.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attack is remote; the attacker does not need local access to the victim's machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) was involved in the discovery and disclosure of this vulnerability.
- Microsoft released a security update (MS11-022) to address this vulnerability.
-  Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID '10885'.
- A Microsoft "Fix it" solution to disable editing in protected view could be used as a workaround in PowerPoint 2010.
- Microsoft also recommends using the Office File Block Policy to prevent opening Office 2003 and earlier documents from untrusted locations.
