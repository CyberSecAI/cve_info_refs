Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0412:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of password hashes within Oracle Solaris 10 back-out patch files (undo.Z). These files are intended to revert changes made by a patch, but they inadvertently included sensitive password hash data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inclusion of Sensitive Data:** Password hashes, which are meant to be protected, were stored within back-out patch files.
*   **Inadequate File Permissions:**  The vulnerability is exacerbated because these back-out patch files can, in some cases, have world-readable permissions, making the password hashes accessible to unprivileged users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Exposure:** An attacker who exploits this vulnerability could extract password hashes from the back-out patch files.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  With the extracted hashes, the attacker could perform brute-force attacks to recover the actual passwords.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful recovery of passwords, especially for the root user, could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the affected system can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **File System Access:** Specifically, the attacker needs read access to the back-out patch files which are typically stored at `/var/sadm/pkg/<pkgname>/save/<patchid>/undo.Z`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unprivileged User Account:** The attacker needs an unprivileged user account on the affected system.
*   **File System Read Access:** The attacker must be able to read the back-out patch files, typically achieved through incorrect file permissions on these files.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability was reported by Michael Rutkowski of Duer Advanced Technology and Aerospace, Inc (DATA).
* A patch (119254-80) is available that addresses the issue and is part of the April 1st recommended patch set for Solaris 10.
*  System administrators should also ensure that back-out patch file permissions are restricted and not world-readable.
