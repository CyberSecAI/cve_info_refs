         "vulnerability": "It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, contains a race condition when processing zones updates in an authoritative server, either through dynamic DNS updates or incremental zone transfer (IXFR).

        "description": "When an authoritative server processes a successful IXFR transfer or a dynamic update, there is a small window of time during which the IXFR/update coupled with a query may cause a deadlock to occur.
