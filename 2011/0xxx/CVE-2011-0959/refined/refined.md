Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0959:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization within the Cisco Unified Operations Manager (CuOM) web application. Specifically, the application does not adequately filter user-supplied input before reflecting it back in the web page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This means that the malicious script is injected into the HTTP request and reflected back in the HTTP response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
*   Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.
*   Potentially steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking and impersonation.
*   Perform actions on behalf of the user, depending on the application's functionality.
*   Redirect the user to a malicious website.
*   Modify the content of the vulnerable web page.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL that contains malicious JavaScript code within specific parameters of the vulnerable application's endpoints. The attacker needs to lure the victim to click on the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to create a malicious URL that exploits the XSS vulnerability in the CuOM application.
*   The attacker needs to find a way to get the victim to click on the crafted URL, such as through email, instant messages, or a malicious website.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the vulnerable system. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   The victim needs to be logged in or have a valid session with the vulnerable CuOM application for some attacks to be successful.

**Technical Details:**
The provided exploit examples show several vulnerable URLs, all within the `iptm` directory:
*   `/iptm/advancedfind.do`
*   `/iptm/ddv.do`
*   `/iptm/eventmon`
*   `/iptm/faultmon/ui/dojo/Main/eventmon_wrapper.jsp`
*   `/iptm/logicalTopo.do`

These URLs demonstrate how malicious script tags can be embedded within the URL parameters (e.g., `extn`, `deviceInstanceName`, `cmd`, `group`, `clusterName`, `deviceName`, `ccmName`) and reflected back in the application response, leading to script execution in the user's browser.

The advisory also mentions that a fix is available by upgrading to CuOM 8.6.
