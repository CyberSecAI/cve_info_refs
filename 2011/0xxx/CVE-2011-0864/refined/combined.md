How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0862 CVE-2011-0864 CVE-2011-0865 CVE-2011-0867 CVE-2011-0868 CVE-2011-0869 CVE-2011-0871
Debian Bug     : 629852

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java SE platform.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:

CVE-2011-0862
	Integer overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow
	untrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.

CVE-2011-0864
	Hotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled
	certain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code
	(including applets) to crash the virtual machine.

CVE-2011-0865
	A race condition in signed object deserialization could
	allow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently
	leaving its signature intact.

CVE-2011-0867
	Untrusted code (including applets) could access information
	about network interfaces which was not intended to be public.
	(Note that the interface MAC address is still available to
	untrusted code.)

CVE-2011-0868
	A float-to-long conversion could overflow, , allowing
	untrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual
	machine.

CVE-2011-0869
	Untrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP
	requests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP
	connection.

CVE-2011-0871
	Untrusted code (including applets) could elevate its
	privileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.

In addition, this update removes support for the Zero/Shark and Cacao
Hotspot variants from the i386 and amd64 due to stability issues.
These Hotspot variants are included in the openjdk-6-jre-zero and
icedtea-6-jre-cacao packages, and these packages must be removed
during this update.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems will be fixed
in a separate DSA for technical reasons.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1~squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid(, these problems have been fixed in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your OpenJDK packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2011

## Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory - June 2011

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. The Critical Patch Update for Java SE also includes non-security fixes. Critical Patch Updates are cumulative and each advisory describes only the security fixes added since the previous Critical Patch Update. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update Advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier accumulated security fixes. Please refer to:

[Critical Patch Updates and Security Alerts](/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible.** This Critical Patch Update contains 17 new security fixes across Java SE products.

### Supported Products Affected

Security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update affect the products listed in the categories below. Please click on the link in the Patch Availability column or in the [Patch Availability Table](#PatchTable) to access the documentation for those patches.

#### Affected product releases and versions:

| Java SE | Patch Availability |
| --- | --- |
| JDK and JRE 6 Update 25 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| JDK 5.0 Update 29 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |
| SDK 1.4.2\_31 and earlier | [Java SE](#PatchTable) |

### Patch Availability Table and Risk Matrix

Java SE fixes in this Update are cumulative; the latest Critical Patch Update includes all fixes from the previous Critical Patch Updates.

#### Patch Availability Table

| Product Group | Risk Matrix | Patch Availability and Installation Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java SE | [Java SE](#AppendixJAVA) | * Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update June 2011 [My Oracle Support Note 1324887.1.](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1324887.1) * Developers can download the latest release from [http://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html.](/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) * Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from [http://java.com.](//java.com) Users on the Windows platform can also use [automatic updates](//www.java.com/en/download/help/5000020700.xml) to get the latest release. |

#### Risk Matrix Content

The risk matrix lists only security vulnerabilities that are newly fixed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for [previous](/security-alerts/) security fixes can be found in previous Critical Patch Update advisories.

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 2.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS 2.0). Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update (CPU). Oracle does not disclose information about the security analysis, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential result of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. As a matter of policy, Oracle does not disclose detailed information about an exploit condition or results that can be used to conduct a successful exploit. Oracle will not provide additional information about the specifics of vulnerabilities beyond what is provided in the CPU or Security Alert notification, the Patch Availability Matrix, the readme files, and FAQs. Oracle does not provide advance notification on CPUs or Security Alerts to individual customers. Finally, Oracle does not distribute exploit code or “proof-of-concept” code for product vulnerabilities.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply CPU fixes as soon as possible**. Until you apply the CPU fixes, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by restricting network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from unprivileged users may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply fixes as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Security advisories, please review [previous](/security-alerts/) advisories to determine appropriate actions.

### Unsupported Products and De-Supported Versions

Unsupported products, releases and versions are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. Hence Oracle recommends that customers upgrade their Oracle products to a supported version.

Critical Patch Update patches are not provided for product versions that are no longer supported. We recommend that customers upgrade to the latest supported version of Oracle products in order to obtain patches.

### Credit Statement

The following people or organizations reported security vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update to Oracle: an Anonymous Reporter of TippingPoint's Zero Day Initiative; Aniway.Anyway via TippingPoint; binaryproof via iDefense; binaryproof via TippingPoint; Chris Ries via TippingPoint; Hisashi Kojima of Fujitsu Laboratories via JPCERT/CC; iDefense; Marc Schoenefeld of Red Hat; Peter Vreugdenhil of TippingPoint DVLabs; and Stephen Fewer of Harmony Security via TippingPoint.

### Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Schedule

The next three dates for Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Updates are:

* 18 October 2011
* 14 February 2012
* 12 June 2012

### Appendix - Oracle Java SE

#### Oracle Java SE Executive Summary

This Critical Patch Update contains 17 new security fixes for Oracle Java SE - 5 apply to client and server deployments of Java SE, 11 apply to client deployments of Java SE only, and 1 applies to server deployments of Java SE only. All of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password.

CVSS scores below assume that a user running a Java applet or Java Web Start application has administrator privileges (typical on Windows). Where the user does not run with administrator privileges (typical on Solaris and Linux), the corresponding CVSS impact scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are "Partial" instead of "Complete", and the corresponding CVSS Base score is 7.5 instead of 10 respectively.

For issues in Deployment, fixes are only made available for JDK and JRE 6. Users should use the Java Web Start in JRE 6 and the new Java Plug-in introduced in 6 Update 10.

[My Oracle Support Note 360870.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/ui/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?id=360870.1) explains the impact of Java security vulnerabilities on Oracle products that include an Oracle Java SE JDK or JRE.

---

## 1. Overview:

The Sun 1.6.0 Java release includes the Sun Java 6 Runtime Environment and
the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit.

This update fixes several vulnerabilities in the Sun Java 6 Runtime
Environment and the Sun Java 6 Software Development Kit. Further
information about these flaws can be found on the ["Oracle Java SE Critical Patch Update Advisory" page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/javacpujune2011-313339.html).
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0802](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0802.html), [CVE-2011-0814](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0814.html), [CVE-2011-0862](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0862.html), [CVE-2011-0863](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0863.html), [CVE-2011-0864](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0864.html), [CVE-2011-0865](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0865.html), [CVE-2011-0867](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0867.html), [CVE-2011-0868](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0868.html), [CVE-2011-0869](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0869.html), [CVE-2011-0871](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0871.html) and [CVE-2011-0873](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0873.html) to these issues.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0860.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Aura® Conferencing Standard Edition | 6.0.x | Low | See Recommended Actions and Mitigating Factors table below. This advisory will not be addressed as no further releases are planned. It is recommended that customers migrate to one of Avaya's conferencing solutions including Aura® Conferencing 7.0 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0862 CVE-2011-0802 CVE-2011-0814 CVE-2011-0868 CVE-2011-0873 | The risk is Low for these CVEs because they would require an untrusted Java Web Start application or untrusted Java applet to run on the product, which could only happen through non-standard user interaction. They are also not exploitable through the network APIs as this product does not open external web services ports for graphics and sound through the JRE. |
| CVE-2011-0863 CVE-2011-0864 CVE-2011-0865 CVE-2011-0867 CVE-2011-0869 CVE-2011-0871 | The risk is Low for these CVEs because they would require an untrusted Java Web Start application or untrusted Java applet to run on the product, which could only happen through non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.
