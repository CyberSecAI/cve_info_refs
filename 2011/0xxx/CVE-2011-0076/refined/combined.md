| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Apple's Product Security Team contacted us with the following report:
I work for Apple's Product Security team. We have discovered a vulnerability in the JEP or LiveConnect java bridge in Firefox. We initially investigated this as a bug in the Java distribution, but it now seems to be a Mozilla-specific problem. Therefore I'm giving you the proof-of-concept so that you can investigate further.
===== javafs.html =======
<script>
document.write('Free disk space: ' + java.io.FileSystem.getFileSystem().getSpace(new java.io.File('/'), 0));
</script>
===== cut =======
1. Put javafs.html (contents per the above) on a web server.
2. Visit that page in Firefox.
3. Note how the script was permitted to get a reference to the java.io.FileSystem class, even though it is declared package-local.
I reproduced the issue with Firefox 3.6.13.

Dan, please ask Apple where the java.io.FileSystem class "is declared
package-local".
When I have time (this weekend?) I'm going to try to find out exactly
how serious this is. For example, does it give you the same level of
access to the file system as the currently logged in user? I have my
doubts, but we do need to find out.

One difference between running 3.6.13 on OSX 10.5 vs 106 is the version of Java you get. On 10.5.8 I get Java 1.5.0\_26, and do not suffer the bug. On 10.6.6 bsterne gets Java 1.6.0\_22 and can reproduce. Both of us using JEP 0.9.7.3 as shipped.

Actually the current version of the JEP (bundled with Mozilla branch distros) is 0.9.7.4.
Whether or not the java.io.FileSystem class "is declared package-local" (whatever that means), it \*is\* undocumented. But Sun/Oracle's JDK source distros do contain source for it (and therefore a list of all its methods). I'm going to use those methods to see exactly how much an unprivileged user can do with a java.io.FileSystem object.

[Better testcase](attachment.cgi?id=513892)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=513892&action=edit)

This is bad, and is truly a bug in the JEP. It appears to give almost
the same access to the local filesystem as the currently logged on
user: The java.io.FileSystem class can be used to list directories
and to create and delete files -- though though not (as best I can
tell) to read any files.
Here's a better testcase, which "works" on both OS X 10.6.X and
10.5.X. The only reason the previous testcase failed on 10.5 is that
J2SE 5.0 java.io.FileSystem class lacks a getSpace() method.
As we've already seen, this bug doesn't exist in Apple/Sun/Oracle's
Java Plugin2 implementation. Additional tests show it doesn't exist
in Java Plugin2 on Windows or Linux, or even in Sun/Oracle's OJI
plugin (at least on Linux -- I'm unable to test this on Windows).
A "package local" class is one that's supposed to be accessible only
from within the package (which in this case is the "java.lang"
package) -- its definition lacks the "public" keyword. So even in
privileged code, you get a compiler error if you try to use
java.io.FileSystem in a Java applet or application (though there are
ways around this that work only in privileged code).
There's also a mechanism to prevent access from non-privileged code to
restricted packages (for example all those whose names start with
"sun."). This works fine in the JEP. And I was frankly unaware that
there was anything in the "non restricted" packages (e.g. "java.lang")
that might cause trouble.
I was wrong :-(
I have some ideas about fixing this. I'll be spending the next few
days trying them out. I hope to have a new JEP (0.9.7.5) in the next
week or so.

Can you launch processes? Add processes? Are there other such packages that might allow worse? Unless some of those answers are "yes" then sg:critical sounds a bit high. Deleting your OS is a rather severe DoS.

> Can you launch processes? Add processes?
No, not with java.io.FileSystem.
> Are there other such packages that might allow worse?
I don't know. And it's rather hard to find out -- you have to search
for every class whose definition lacks the "public" keyword, which is
rather hard to automate.
> Deleting your OS is a rather severe DoS.
You can delete any files that the currently logged on user can delete
-- enough to do pretty severe damage, though not to "delete the OS".
And remember that you can also navigate directories (at least those
accessible to the currently logged on user).

No.
You can use java.io.FileSystem to delete or create files, but you
can't use it to write to or read from files. (And you'll get a
security exception if you try to use java.io.File to write to or read
from files.)
I forgot to mention earlier that you can also use java.io.FileSystem
to rename files. But I don't know if this will let you move files
from one location to another.

I've got a patch for this that, in considerable testing, fixes the
problem without breaking anything else.
But the problem is subtle, and along the way I discovered another
solution that might turn out to be better in the long run, but which
might take me another week to implement.
So I'm going to put my current patch aside for the next week and work
on FF4 bugs ... of which there's no shortage. I'll see what I think
when I come back.
By the way, even my current fix addresses more than just
java.io.FileSystem: It stops JavaScript-to-Java LiveConnect from
accessing any package-local class in "system" packages (like
java.lang).

While testing for [bug 629030](/show_bug.cgi?id=629030 "RESOLVED FIXED - Java JRE broken in FF 3.6.14 [pogo.com]"), I discovered that my patch made
reloading applets sometimes fail. So I decided to start over again
from scratch.
I've now got a much better (simpler) patch, but I'm still tweaking it
as I run more tests. I think I'm a day or two away from "releasing" a
new version (0.9.7.5) that fixes this bug (I won't make the source
code public until some time has passed after this bug is fixed on the
branches, to allow time for people to upgrade).
After the recent security-fix releases (FF 3.6.16 and 3.5.18), the
next regularly-scheduled releases are 3.6.17 and 3.5.19. As I
understand it, the code freeze for blockers for these versions is
tomorrow (Thursday, 2011-03-24).
For some time this bug has been marked blocking1.9.2.17+ and
blocking1.9.1.19+. It still is -- these numbers haven't been bumped
since the security-fix releases. For a while I suspected this was a
mistake, and have been trying to make this Thursday's deadline. I
still think I can make it, but it will be cutting things very close.
So my question (for whoever can answer it) is: Does this bug block
the next branch releases (expected to be FF 3.6.17 and 3.5.19), or the
following set of branch releases (expected to be FF 3.6.18 and 3.5.20)?
Needless to say, I need the answer very quickly.

The bug has been blocking "the next (non-chemspill) release" since Feb 25 when it was marked ".15+". The field value was renamed along the way so that it now says .17+ to match the fact that the planned April release was renamed to 3.6.17, but the intended release remained the same. The situation would be clearer if we used alphabetical codenames as proposed by clegnitto, the "macaw" release would remain "macaw" even if you had to insert "anteater" and "boa" releases in the meantime.
The code-freeze tomorrow is still intended to apply to this bug. Release schedules can be found at <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Releases>

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

# BMO/UserGuide/Whiteboard

From MozillaWiki
< [BMO](/BMO "BMO")‎ | [UserGuide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide")

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Contents

* [1 Whiteboard considered harmful](#Whiteboard_considered_harmful)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=644682#c0)• 14 years ago |
|  | |

JEP 0.9.7.5 fixes a major security hole ([bug 634724](/show_bug.cgi?id=634724 "RESOLVED FIXED - JEP allows almost full local-user access to file system via java.io.FileSystem object")), and also works
around some breakage caused by Apple's latest Java updates (Update 4
for OS X 10.6 and Update 9 for OS X 10.5). One of these
Apple-triggered problems is itself a major bug -- as of Apple's latest
updates, older versions of the JEP now leak all Java applets (they
don't get destroyed when the plugin is unloaded).
Because I don't want to reveal too much about the security bug before
it's been fixed in all current Mozilla releases, I haven't yet
formally released JEP 0.9.7.5 (I haven't yet uploaded it to
<http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/>). That's also why I've marked this
bug security sensitive.
I'll email copies of the JEP 0.9.7.5 distro to Josh (who I'm going to
ask to review), and to anyone else who wants one. It's about 4MB.
JEP 0.9.7.5 needs to be landed on the current branches today, to make
the code freeze for FF 3.6.17 and 3.5.19. Sorry I've cut it so close,
but I had little choice. Fixing [bug 634724](/show_bug.cgi?id=634724 "RESOLVED FIXED - JEP allows almost full local-user access to file system via java.io.FileSystem object") took much longer than
expected, and I also didn't expect to have to deal with Apple's
breakage.
It should probably also be landed on the 1.9.0 branch, so Camino can
pick it up.
Those who want to try the new version right away will need to install
it "over" the older versions currently bundled with Mozilla.org
browsers. I recommend doing the following. Note that these
instructions have changed from what I used to recommend. This is
because Apple made changes in their most recent Java Updates (on OS X
10.5.X and 10.6.X) that cause the previous instructions to no longer
work properly.
For each of the browser binaries you wish to update:
1) Control-click (or right-click) on the browser binary and choose
"Show Package Contents".
2) Browse to the Contents/MacOS/plugins folder and delete
JavaEmbeddingPlugin.bundle and MRJPlugin.plugin.
3) Drag copies of the new Java Embedding Plugin binaries to the
Contents/MacOS/plugins folder.

Steven, can you mail me (at this address) a copy for some quick testing, since this new version is not yet available publicly?
And, yes, we do want this to land on 1.9.0 for the hopefully-final Camino 2.0.8 release.

Does the new JEP still work on machines that have \_not\_ been upgraded with the latest Apple Java update?
Requesting (not granting) approval to make sure it shows up in release bug queries. Waiting for Josh's review for approval

Yes. I always maintain backwards compatibility with previous Java updates.

I've released JEP 0.9.7.5 to the public at
<http://javaplugin.sourceforge.net/>.
Starting with JEP 0.9.7.4, I began postponing the formal release of
JEP versions that included fixes for security bugs. The idea was to
reveal as little information as possible about these bugs until fixes
had gotten into current releases of Mozilla browsers, and users had
been given a chance to upgrade.
My intention was to do Mozilla and Mozilla users a favor. But this
favor went (mostly) unnoticed for months, and then caused considerable
displeasure at the last possible minute before the next round of
branch releases. Which (in some people's minds) made me appear to be
reluctant to release JEP source -- which is the very last thing I
want.
So from now on I'm going to formally release every new version of the
JEP before I ask for it to be landed in the tree, even if it contains
security fixes.
My change of policy is partly due to the bad feeling all this has
caused. But mostly it's because I now think I was being too cautious.
In most cases (and certainly for the two security bugs fixed in JEP
0.9.7.4 and 0.9.7.5), seeing how a security bug was fixed doesn't tell
you how to exploit it. You need to be a bit cagey about what you say
in your code comments and change logs. But I \*have\* been -- for
example I never described the exploits directly, but instead pointed
people to bmo bugs where they were described (which can be kept
restricted until the danger has passed).
It's conceivable someone could discover a security hole so obvious
that its fix would reveal how to exploit it. If this happens I'd be
willing to make an exception. But I think it's extremely unlikely.
It helps that the JEP has had very few security holes -- only two
since it started being bundled with Mozilla browsers. And of these
only the latest one was really the JEP's fault (or more properly the
fault of the MRJ Plugin Carbon code inherited by the JEP).

Marcia and Matt, I'm asking for special attention to Java during QA's
testing of the next two regularly-scheduled branch releases (1.9.2.17
and 1.9.1.19).
As always, I've been quite thorough in my own testing. But because
[bug 634724](/show_bug.cgi?id=634724 "RESOLVED FIXED - JEP allows almost full local-user access to file system via java.io.FileSystem object") was much harder to fix than I expected (and because I took
considerable time out to work on Mozilla bugs), JEP 0.9.7.5 will only
be on the branches for a very short time before it goes out in
releases. So it'll get less user testing than normal.
Probably the best resource for Java testing is the information at bug
371084. If you guys need any help, I'd be more than happy to provide
it.
Thanks in advance!

In light of what I said in [comment #10](/show_bug.cgi?id=644682#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - New version of JEP (0.9.7.5), please land on branches"), I don't think this bug needs
to be security-sensitive. If I hear no objections, I'll uncheck the
box early next week.
