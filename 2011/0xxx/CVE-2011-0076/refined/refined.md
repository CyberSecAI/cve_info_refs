The provided content relates to CVE-2011-0076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the Java Embedding Plugin (JEP) allowing access to the package-local `java.io.FileSystem` object, which should not be accessible from unprivileged code. This object provides methods that enable file system access, such as directory listing, file creation and deletion.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the ability to access a package-local class, `java.io.FileSystem`, which should not be accessible from JavaScript code running in a web browser. This class, while not documented, has methods allowing for file system operations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can potentially gain almost full local-user access to the file system. This includes listing directories, creating files, deleting files, and renaming files. Although the vulnerability doesn't allow reading or writing to files, the ability to create, delete, and rename files can still cause significant damage. This could potentially be used for a denial-of-service attack.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malicious website that uses JavaScript to access the `java.io.FileSystem` object. This can be achieved by embedding the JavaScript within an HTML document hosted on a web server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious HTML page that a user visits using a vulnerable version of Firefox that includes the vulnerable JEP plugin on macOS. The user must have the JEP plugin enabled. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the target system beyond what the user has.
