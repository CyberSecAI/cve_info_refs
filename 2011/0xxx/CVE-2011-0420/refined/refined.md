Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0420:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference in the `grapheme_extract()` function of the PHP Internationalization extension (Intl). Specifically, when the size parameter is set to -1, it leads to an integer underflow in the calculation of the string length and eventually results in a NULL pointer dereference when accessing the string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference, which occurs when the code tries to access a memory location pointed to by a NULL pointer.
- **Integer Underflow:** An integer underflow occurs when calculating the string length, leading to an invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial-of-service condition, where the vulnerable application crashes due to the NULL pointer dereference. The exploit can cause the application to terminate unexpectedly.
- **Code Execution (potentially):** The exploit description notes that modifying the length of the input string could change the RIP (instruction pointer), indicating the potential for controlled code execution if further exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by providing a specially crafted input to the vulnerable PHP application via the `grapheme_extract()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to submit input that calls the `grapheme_extract()` function with the size parameter set to -1. This could be through a web interface, a vulnerable script, or any other entry point that uses the vulnerable function.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in PHP version 5.3.5.
- The provided exploit code shows that a call to `grapheme_extract('a',-1)` can trigger the crash.
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in PHP's SVN revision 306449.
- This vulnerability is also mentioned in Debian Security Advisory DSA-2266-1, confirming its cross-platform nature and impact on Debian based systems.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to crash a PHP application by providing a specific input, and potentially can be leveraged to gain code execution, making it a serious security issue.
