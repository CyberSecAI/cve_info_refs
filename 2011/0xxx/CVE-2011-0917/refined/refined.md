Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-0917:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `nLDAP.exe` component of IBM Lotus Domino, which listens on TCP port 389 by default.
*   When handling an LDAP Bind Request packet, the process blindly copies user-supplied data into an undersized shared memory buffer. This lack of bounds checking on the input data leads to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The core vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to insufficient size validation on the data received in the LDAP bind request.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it easily accessible to remote attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable IBM Lotus Domino server.
*   **SYSTEM User Context:** The attacker's code runs with the privileges of the SYSTEM user, which is the highest privilege level on a Windows system. This gives the attacker complete control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is over the network, specifically targeting the service listening on TCP port 389.
*   **LDAP Bind Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted LDAP Bind Request packet to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server listening on TCP port 389.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided resources:**

*   The exploit-db entry includes a perl script which demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability using a specially crafted LDAP Bind request. The script sends a large amount of "A" characters, illustrating the buffer overflow.
*   Trend Micro's advisory confirms that their TippingPoint IPS provides protection against this vulnerability through a filter with ID '10282'.
