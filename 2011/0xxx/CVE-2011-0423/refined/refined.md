The provided content describes vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2010-0214, not CVE-2011-0423.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The PolyVision RoomWizard scheduling system has two vulnerabilities:
1.  A default password ("roomwizard") is used for the administrative account, allowing unauthorized console access.
2.  The Sync Connector Active Directory (AD) credentials are exposed in clear text within a web page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  Use of a default, easily guessable password for the administrator account.
2.  Clear text exposure of sensitive Sync Connector AD credentials in the HTML source of a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  An attacker can access the device's administrative console and modify settings, potentially disrupting legitimate use, including network configurations, and access to the device.
2.  An attacker can obtain the Sync Connector AD credentials, potentially compromising the connected Active Directory environment and allowing access to other network resources.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  HTTP access to the RoomWizard device's web interface.
2.  Access to the web page containing the exposed credentials through the device's web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  Network access to the RoomWizard device on port 80 (HTTP).
2.  Knowledge of the default administrative password.
