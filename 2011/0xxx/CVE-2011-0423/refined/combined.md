will result in a leakage of the Sync Connector username and password on two
input boxes (password masked via type = password):

.....type="text" name="connectorusername" value="DOMAIN/DOMAINID"></td>

.....type="password" name="connectorpassword" value="DOMAINIDPASS"></td>

## PolyVision RoomWizard insecurely stores Sync Connector Active Directory credentials and uses default administrative password

#### Vulnerability Note VU#870601

Original Release Date: 2011-01-07 | Last Revised: 2011-01-07

---

### Overview

The PolyVision RoomWizard web based scheduling system with touch screen display contains two vulnerabilities that allow an unauthorized user to access the device console and Sync Connector Active Directory credentials.

### Description

| The PolyVision RoomWizard is a touch screen scheduling device with a web-based administrative interface. The Sync Connector feature allows the RoomWizard to communicate with Microsoft Exchange in an Microsoft Windows Actitve Directory (AD) environment. The Sync Connector AD credentials are disclosed in the content of a web page on the administrative interface. This vulnerability has been reported to be affected in RoomWizard firmware version 3.2.3.  An additional issue exists in that the RoomWizard ships with a default password on the administrator account permitting console access via HTTP. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An attacker with HTTP access to a RoomWizard device and knowledge of the administrative password could obtain the AD credentials. The attacker could also modify settings, including network configuration, which could prevent legitimate users from accessing the RoomWizard device. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Change default passwords**Change the default administrative password before deploying RoomWizard devices in an production environment.**Upgrade**It has been reported to us that RoomWizard firmware version 3.2.3 is affected by this vulnerability. PolyVision was unable to reproduce the Sync Connector AD credentials vulnerability utilizing the latest revisions of the Room Wizard [firmware](http://steelcase.polyvision.com/support/downloads-roomwiz.asp), version 3.5. PolyVision recommends all RoomWizard devices be upgraded to the latest version of [firmware](http://steelcase.polyvision.com/support/downloads-roomwiz.asp). |
| --- |

| **Restrict access**Restrict network access to the RoomWizard and other devices using open protocols like HTTP.PolyVision also recommends requiring the use of SSL on the RoomWizard device if possible. |
