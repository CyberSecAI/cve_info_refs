We released the new Iron 8 today, which contains all features and updates known from Chromim 8. The current version is 8.0.555.0.

Beside of the possibility to use the [AppStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) this release mainly contains bug- and securitypatches. But you can try new features with "about:flags".

DAmn! spoke too soon! The --enable-cookie-prompt doesn't work in this version. When is 8.0.555.1 coming out with the fixes that got lost in this release?

Oops! Just installed 8.0.555.0 and noticed that the speed dial page (so sue me I am mainly an Opera user) only shows 8 instead of 12 positions.

For me, this was a deal breaker, so it's back to 7.x for now.

What are the chances this could get repaired quickly? (what would be better would be a way to dial it in individually, as is possible with Opera - in my Opera browser I have 5 rows and 6 columns.)

***The problem with the many tabs was because of the extension "Webmail Ad Blocker" and "Open in the background Tab" extension" for Chrome.

The speed never disappoints me, IT'S FREAKING FAST AT LOADING!

Amazing product.***

***I was incorrect, neither one of extensions had impact, after I removed them.

I will stick to middle-click, for now. ![:P](./images/smilies/icon_razz.gif "Razz")

Speed still hasn't failed me, so nothing more to say.***

Great news! If based on Chromium then it's not only bug-fix release. There are some new features such as Chrome Web Store access. You can go there and install apps. The apps are accessible from the "new tab" page. I have not checked if it works in new Iron yet.

Huh...I'm going to wait to see if this gets fixed before i update. Watch out for that chrome apps store. I bet most of those apps have an auto-updater, which links you right to their servers, enableing some tracking features i got a warning pop-up when trying a couple out before. i terminated the install when i saw that.

Hello SRWare Iron 8 that has just been released seems to have this error coming up every so often when running on Windows XP Pro SP3:

iron.exe - Unable to Locate Component

This application has failed to start because d3dx9\_43.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.

Didn't have this problem in earlier versions of Iron.

Release updates from the Chrome team

## [Chrome Stable Release](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2011/01/chrome-stable-release.html "Chrome Stable Release")

Wednesday, January 12, 2011

Chrome on stable channel has been updated to 8.0.552.237 for all platforms.  Chrome OS has also been updated, to 8.0.552.334. These releases contain the security fixes listed below.

Security fixes and rewards:

Please see [the Chromium security page](http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-security) for more detail. Note that the referenced bugs may be kept private until a majority of our users are up to date with the fix.

We’re delighted to offer our first “elite” $3133.7 [Chromium Security Reward](http://blog.chromium.org/2010/07/celebrating-six-months-of-chromium.html) to Sergey Glazunov. Critical bugs are harder to come by in Chrome, but Sergey has done it. Sergey also collects a $1337 reward and several other rewards at the same time, so congratulations Sergey!

Also of note is a clarification on our default charity policy. Some researchers are unable to accept rewards, or even provide a suggestion for a charity. In such cases, it feels like a shame to lose a charitable contribution so we will default reward money to the Red Cross.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
