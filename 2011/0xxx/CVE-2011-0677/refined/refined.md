{
  "CVE-2011-0677": {
    "Description": "An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to the way that Windows Kernel-mode drivers manage pointers to kernel-mode driver objects. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a Null pointer de-reference due to the way kernel-mode drivers keep track of pointers to certain kernel-mode driver objects.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run arbitrary code in kernel mode, leading to complete control of the affected system. This includes the ability to install programs, view/change/delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker must log on to the system locally and then run a specially crafted application.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs valid logon credentials and the ability to log on locally to the system. They must also be able to execute a specially crafted application.",
        "Additional Information": "This vulnerability is one of several addressed by Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-034. The vulnerability resides in the `win32k.sys` driver, which is the kernel part of the Windows subsystem, containing the window manager and GDI."
