- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A format string issue existed in AppleScript Studio's generic dialog commands ("display dialog" and "display alert").
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Format string vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Running an AppleScript Studio-based application that allows untrusted input to be passed to a dialog.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide untrusted input to an AppleScript Studio-based application that uses the vulnerable "display dialog" or "display alert" commands.
