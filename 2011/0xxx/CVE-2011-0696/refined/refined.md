{
  "CVE-2011-0696": {
    "Description": "It was discovered that Django did not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
    "Root cause": "Django's CSRF protection made an exception for AJAX requests based on the presence of the `X-Requested-With` header, assuming that browsers' same-origin policy for `XMLHttpRequest` prevented malicious custom headers. However, it was found that browser plugins and redirects could allow an attacker to provide custom HTTP headers, bypassing the CSRF protection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of HTTP requests with `X-Requested-With` header.",
      "Trusting the `X-Requested-With` header to indicate a legitimate AJAX request."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, potentially allowing them to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through a combination of browser plugins and redirects which can be used to provide custom HTTP headers on requests to any website.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage or using a browser with a malicious plugin that can add a custom `X-Requested-With` header to a request."
