How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# Security Advisory 1102

```

Summary           : Insufficient input validation in MKV demuxer
Date              : January 2011
Affected versions : VLC media player 1.1.6.1 and earlier
ID                : VideoLAN-SA-1102
CVE reference     : CVE-2011-0531

```
## Details

When parsing an invalid MKV (Matroska or WebM) file,
input validation are insufficient.

## Impact

If successful,
a malicious third party will be able to trigger execution of arbitrary code.

## Threat mitigation

Exploitation of this issue requires the user
to explicitly open a specially crafted file.

## Workarounds

The user should refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties
or accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins),
until the patch is applied.

Alternatively, the MKV demuxer plugin
(`libmkv_plugin.*`)
can be removed manually from the VLC plugin installation directory.

## Solution

VLC media player 1.1.7 addresses this issue.
Patches for older versions are available
from the official VLC source code repositories.

## Credits

This vulnerability was reported by Dan Rosenberg from VSR.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Package        : vlc
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitising
Problem type   : (local)remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0531

Dan Rosenberg discovered that insufficient input validation in VLC's
processing of Matroska/WebM containers could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze3.

The version of vlc in the oldstable distribution (lenny) is affected
by further issues and will be addressed in a followup DSA.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.7-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.

Subject: CVE request: code execution in VLC media player

When opening a malformed MKV (WebM or Matroska) file in VLC, it is
possible to corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code.
Proof-of-concept exploit code is available and may be made public
soon.
