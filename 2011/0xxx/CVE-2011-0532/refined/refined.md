Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0532:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the insecure use of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in various shell scripts of Red Hat Directory Server. These scripts set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to a value containing empty path elements (e.g., `::` or a leading or trailing `:`). This happens due to expansion of certain configure variables to empty string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:** Setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with empty paths causes the dynamic linker (`ld.so`) to search for shared libraries in the current working directory *before* searching system library directories.
*   **Empty Path Elements:**  The use of `::`, leading `:`, or trailing `:` in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` creates an implicit reference to the current working directory, which is insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker who can trick a user (typically the root user) into running the affected scripts from an attacker-controlled directory can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can create a malicious shared library with the same name as one normally loaded by the script. When the script is executed with the vulnerable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, the dynamic linker will load the attacker's malicious library instead of the legitimate one. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the script.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
*   **Tricking User:** The attacker must be able to trick a user (usually root) into executing one of the affected scripts from a directory writable by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some form of local access to the system where the vulnerable Directory Server is installed.
*   **Writable Directory:** The attacker needs to be able to write to a directory.
*   **Ability to Trick User:** The attacker needs a way to make a privileged user execute one of the affected scripts from the attacker's directory. This might involve social engineering or exploiting other system vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue also affected `SHLIB_PATH` on HP-UX systems. Although the behavior of empty paths in `SHLIB_PATH` might differ from `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on glibc systems, the scripts were setting them to the same value. Thus, fixing `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` should address most `SHLIB_PATH` issues as well.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Directory Server 8 for RHEL 4 and RHEL 5 via RHSA-2011:0293.
