Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-0762 from the provided documents:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how vsftpd handles certain glob expressions within the `STAT` command. Specifically, the `vsf_filename_passes_filter` function in `ls.c` has a flaw in parsing and handling nested brace expressions (e.g., `{{*},...}`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion**: The flawed parsing of complex glob patterns can lead to excessive CPU consumption and process slot exhaustion due to the recursive nature of the parsing logic.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted `STAT` commands with complex glob expressions, an attacker can cause the vsftpd server to become unresponsive.
*   **Unbounded Recursion:** The vulnerable code recursively calls `vsf_filename_passes_filter` without proper limitations when processing brace expressions, resulting in a factorial growth of computation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service by exhausting server resources. The server may become unresponsive, and new connections may be refused.
*   **CPU and Process Exhaustion:** The server processes get stuck in an infinite loop and consume a high percentage of CPU and process slots, leading to resource starvation.
*   **Server Unavailability:**  The excessive resource usage and process exhaustion effectively render the FTP server unusable until the issue is mitigated (e.g. by restarting the service).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via the FTP protocol.
*   **STAT Command:**  The attack uses a specifically crafted `STAT` command containing complex nested glob expressions.
*   **Authenticated Attackers:** The vulnerability requires a valid authenticated FTP user to send the malicious command.
*   **Bypassing max\_per\_ip:** By disconnecting and reconnecting or by using a mobile phone's dynamic IP, an attacker can bypass `max_per_ip` limits to send a high volume of malicious requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the FTP server over the network.
*   **FTP Authentication:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a user account on the target vsftpd server.
*   **Ability to Craft FTP commands:** The attacker must be able to send raw FTP commands, including the `STAT` command with the malicious glob expressions.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is present in the `ls.c` file, specifically in the `vsf_filename_passes_filter` function
*   The issue lies in the way nested brace expressions `{}` with wildcards `*` are handled.
*   The complexity of the glob matching grows factorially with the nesting depth, leading to the DoS

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Maksymilian Arciemowicz.
*   A proof-of-concept exploit (vspoc232.c) is available.
*   The fix involves limiting the recursive calls in the `vsf_filename_passes_filter` function.
*   The fix is available in vsftpd version 2.3.4.
*   Several affected distributions and servers are listed, including: NetBSD 5.1, Ubuntu 10.10 and others.
*   A security bulletin from HP mentions this CVE as a vulnerability in HP Insight Control Software for Linux (IC-Linux).
*   Multiple Linux distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, RedHat) were impacted and issued fixes.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned the identifier VU#590604 by CERT.

In summary, CVE-2011-0762 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in vsftpd that can be exploited by a remote authenticated attacker through a crafted STAT command with a nested glob expression, leading to resource exhaustion.
