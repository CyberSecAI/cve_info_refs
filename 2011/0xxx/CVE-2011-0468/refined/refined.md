      "description": "The aaa_base package before 11.3-8.9.1 in SUSE openSUSE 11.3, and before 11.4-54.62.1 in openSUSE 11.4, allows local users to gain privileges via shell metacharacters in a filename, related to tab expansion.",
      "response": "Root cause of vulnerability: Shell metacharacters in filenames are not properly handled during tab expansion.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The vulnerability exists in the `aaa_base` package within openSUSE 11.3 and 11.4, allowing the execution of arbitrary commands due to the lack of sanitization of filenames during tab expansion in interactive shells.\n\nImpact of exploitation: A local user can gain privileges by exploiting the vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands.\n\nAttack vectors: The vulnerability is exploited by creating a filename containing shell metacharacters, which, when tab-expanded in an interactive shell, allows for command injection.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have local access to the system to create files with specific names and then execute the tab expansion in an interactive shell. No authentication is required, but the attacker has to be a local user."
