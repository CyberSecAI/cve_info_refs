Debian Security Advisory DSA-2171-1                   security@debian.org

Package        : asterisk
Vulnerability  : buffer overflow
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-0495
Debian Bug     : 610487

Matthew Nicholson discovered a buffer overflow in the SIP channel driver
of Asterisk, an open source PBX and telephony toolkit, which could lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny2.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2.9-2+squeeze1.

The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2011-001

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Stack buffer overflow in SIP channel driver |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Exploitable Stack Buffer Overflow |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Authenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Moderate |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | January 11, 2011 |
| **Reported By** | Matthew Nicholson |
| **Posted On** | January 18, 2011 |
| **Last Updated On** | January 20, 2011 |
| **Advisory Contact** | Matthew Nicholson <mnicholson@digium.com> |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2011-0495 |

| **Description** | When forming an outgoing SIP request while in pedantic mode, a stack buffer can be made to overflow if supplied with carefully crafted caller ID information. This vulnerability also affects the URIENCODE dialplan function and in some versions of asterisk, the AGI dialplan application as well. The ast\_uri\_encode function does not properly respect the size of its output buffer and can write past the end of it when encoding URIs. |

| **Resolution** | The size of the output buffer passed to the ast\_uri\_encode function is now properly respected.    In asterisk versions not containing the fix for this issue, limiting strings originating from remote sources that will be URI encoded to a length of 40 characters will protect against this vulnerability.    exten => s,1,Set(CALLERID(num)=${CALLERID(num):0:40})exten => s,n,Set(CALLERID(name)=${CALLERID(name):0:40})exten => s,n,Dial(SIP/channel)    The CALLERID(num) and CALLERID(name) channel values, and any strings passed to the URIENCODE dialplan function should be limited in this manner. |
