Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0495:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `ast_uri_encode` function within the SIP channel driver of Asterisk. This function is responsible for encoding URIs.
*   The `ast_uri_encode` function does not properly validate the size of the output buffer when encoding the URI. Specifically, the function can write past the end of the buffer if the input string requires more space after encoding.
*   This issue occurs when Asterisk is in pedantic mode and processing specially crafted caller ID information, and when using the `URIENCODE` dialplan function, and potentially in some versions of Asterisk in the AGI dialplan application as well.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack buffer overflow:** The primary weakness is the unbounded write to a fixed-size stack buffer within the `ast_uri_encode` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server running Asterisk. This allows an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote attack vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted SIP requests that include malicious caller ID data.
*  **Dialplan manipulation:** The `URIENCODE` dialplan function can be exploited.
*  **AGI dialplan application (in some versions)**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send SIP requests to the Asterisk server.
*  The attacker needs to be able to control the caller ID information or other strings being passed to URI encoding functions.
*   The attacker needs some understanding of Asterisk to craft the malicious input.
*  Some level of access to Asterisk dialplan or AGI might be required.

**Additional Details:**

* The vulnerability was discovered by Matthew Nicholson.
* The issue affects all versions of Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x, 1.4.x, 1.6.x, and 1.8.x. It also impacts all versions of Asterisk Business Edition C.x.x, AsteriskNOW 1.5, and s800i (Asterisk Appliance) 1.2.x.
* The fix involves ensuring the output buffer passed to `ast_uri_encode` is correctly respected.
* A workaround before the fix is available includes limiting the size of strings originating from remote sources which are to be URI encoded to a length of 40 characters.
* The provided code diff shows the change made to `main/utils.c` that limits how much data is written to the buffer.
