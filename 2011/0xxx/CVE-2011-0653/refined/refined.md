    "related": true,
    "summary": "A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 that could lead to information disclosure or elevation of privilege. This occurs when the application fails to properly handle malicious JavaScript elements within a specially crafted URL. When this script is echoed back to the userâ€™s browser, it allows an attacker to issue SharePoint commands in the context of the authenticated user.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper handling of malicious JavaScript elements within a crafted URL in Microsoft SharePoint 2010.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
           "Insufficient input sanitization"
      ],
      "impact": "Elevation of privilege, information disclosure, ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an authenticated user on the targeted SharePoint site.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Web-based attack: hosting a website with a malicious URL.",
        "Email attack: sending an email with a malicious URL."
      ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince a user to click on a specially crafted URL leading to the vulnerable SharePoint site. The attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to run when the user clicks the link but would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie. In addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could also contain content that could exploit this vulnerability."
