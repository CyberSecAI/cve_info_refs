### [Building Rich Internet Applications Models: Example of a Better Strategy](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/06/building-rich-internet-applications-models-example-of-a-better-strategy.html)

Crawling “classical” web applications is a problem that has been addressed more than a decode ago. Efficient crawling of web applications that use advanced technologies such as AJAX (called Rich Internet Applications, RIAs) is still an open problem. Crawling is important not only for indexing content, but also for building models of the applications, which is necessary for automated testing, automated security and accessibility assessments and in general for using software engineering tools. This paper presents a new strategy to crawl RIAs. It uses the concept of Model-Based Crawling (MBC) and introduces a new model, the “menu model”, which we show to be much simpler than previous models for MBC and more effective at building models than previously published methods. This method and others are compared against a set of experimental and real RIAs.

The [SSRG](http://ssrg.eecs.uottawa.ca/members.html) research team will present these findings at ICWE 2013, 11 July@16:00, Aalborg, North Denmark.

### [AppScan Enterprise v8.7 performance improvements](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/05/appscan-enterprise-v87-performance-improvements.html)

In March 2013, we released version 8.7 of AppScan. One of
the focus areas for that release was to improve the scalability and performance
of the enterprise components of the solution, specifically the AppScan
Enterprise Server and AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanner. The
Engineering team made some architecture changes, which  helped dramatically improve the performance
and scalability of these components. In this blog entry, I'd like to provide an
overview of these changes and their effect.

First, the Engineering team separated the database tables
for storing information during the execution of a scan from the central AppScan
Enterprise Server database and moved those tables into a local built-in
database on the AppScan Enterprise Dynamic Analysis Scanner (DAST scan server).  In the previous versions of the product, the
scan server wrote data into the AppScan Enterprise Server central database
throughout the entire duration of the scan. This consumed a lot of resources on
the database server which affected the Web UI performance and greatly limited
the number of scans you could run simultaneously on a scan server. There were
also latency concerns depending on where the scan server was located in
relation to the database server. In version 8.7, scan data is written into a
local built-in database on the scan server. Data is transferred to the central
database on the AppScan Enterprise Server only at the end of a scan (in one
batch). This improved the performance of the Web UI, enabled running more
simultaneous scans on a single scan server and addressed the latency concerns
when the scan server is located far from the database server.

Figures 1 and 2 for a depiction of the implemented architecture
changes.

[![1](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0192aa5744f7970d-800wi "1")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0192aa5744f7970d-pi)

[![2](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0191028ed660970c-800wi "2")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef0191028ed660970c-pi)

Another implementation change made by the Engineering team
was removing the old encryption mechanism for protecting data
"at-rest".  When deploying
v8.7, we recommend that AppScan Enterprise administrators enable the Microsoft
SQL Server Enterprise Edition (2008 and higher) built-in mechanism for data
encryption, Transparent DATA Encryption (TDE), which provides much better
performance.  Alternatively,
administrators could use Encrypting File System which comes with Windows.

So here are the results of the efforts of the Engineering
team:

* Web UI responsiveness has
  increased by approximately 50%
* Scan and reporting
  performance has increased by approximately 50%
* 4-5 scans can run at the
  same time on single DAST scan server
* DAST scan servers can be
  deployed remotely from central AppScan Enterprise Server

We hope that the improved robustness of these
AppScan components will help enhance your overall experience with the product.

### [Research Awards for Project on Crawling Mobile and Rich Internet Applications](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2013/01/research-awards-for-project-on-crawling-mobile-and-rich-internet-applications.html)

**2012  IBM CAS Project of the Year:****Efficient and Scalable Mapping of Mobile and Complex Rich Internet
Applications for Automated Security Testing**

The ability
to “crawl” Web sites and Web applications is at the core of the Internet.
Crawling is necessary to indexing, searching and security testing operations.
With the rise of “Rich Internet Applications” (RIA) there is a tremendous gain
in end-user experience, but it is becoming harder to automatically crawl these
Web sites. Another recent evolution in computing is the move to everything
mobile. Mobile applications are bound to replace desktop applications in the
coming years. It is therefore critical to develop crawling tools adapted to
this new paradigm.

The objective of
this research is to provide efficient and scalable crawling techniques that
work on real life RIAs and mobile applications, and does so entirely
automatically. It builds on the results of our previous research, but tackles
the open problem that some RIA are simply too large to be crawled exhaustively.

The project was awarded by
IBM with the "Project of the year 2012" distinction based on the
following criteria:

* Excel as a research center for the
  advancements of applied science in research areas strategic to IBM
* Harvest and transfer results from advanced research to strategic products and
  initiatives
* Build and foster relationships among researchers, IBM and Customers
* Expose IBM developers to current research directions, and identify new and
  emerging technology issues for academic research.

The award was presented at [CASCON 2012](https://www-927.ibm.com/ibm/cas/cascon/awards.jsp#CAS%20Research%20Project%20of%20the%20Year%20Award).
The research is done in collaboration with [University of Ottawa](http://ssrg.site.uottawa.ca/).

### [Find Security Vulnerabilities in Android Apps](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/12/scan-android-apps.html)

Mobile security can be tested in a variety of ways. You can apply black box testing to test the server side logic that your mobile app is working with, **[as we've recently blogged about](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/have-you-scanned-your-mobile-site-for-vulnerabilities-yet.html)**.

You can also apply static analysis to test the client side. The following short video shows exactly how that's done using IBM Security AppScan Source Edition:

For a more complete overview of mobile security, **[check out the webcast](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/08/the-new-frontier-securing-mobile-apps.html)** we've recently published.

### [Understanding AppScan Test Policies](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/12/understanding-appscan-test-policies.html)

IBM Security Appscan provides automated security scanning of web applications.

Did you know that you can apply **test policies** within IBM Security AppScan to cover particular aspects of the scan? Using the right policy produces optimal scanning results and reduces false positives.

[![Figure-02](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef017c3439d2c0970b-800wi "Figure-02")](https://blog.watchfire.com/.a/6a00d835130c5153ef017c3439d2c0970b-pi)

In **[this great article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/se-appscan/)**, you can get an overview of IBM Security AppScan test policies, and learn which policy is optimal based on the type of application and its stage of development. The article also provides a side-by-side policy comparison that details each scan policy that is offered by the IBM Security AppScan tool.

### [Have you scanned your mobile site for vulnerabilities yet?](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/have-you-scanned-your-mobile-site-for-vulnerabilities-yet.html)

**Mobile sites - Resurrecting security risks**

In today's world any self respecting web site must provide access to its services through a desktop browser **as well as** a mobile device. This basically means that there are **two versions to every site**, one for desktop users and one for mobile users. Are both secure? How do we know for sure?

First, let's take a quick look at some of the reasons why companies would prefer to have mobile users visit a mobile-based site instead of directing them to the original desktop site.

* Technologies - There are certain technologies that are not supported on a mobile device (e.g. Flash on iOS) that would have to be re-designed to meet smartphone requirements.
* User experience - The user experience is completely different. For example, take the hover action, a desktop user can hover over a certain area and have menus sliding this way and that. But on a mobile device hovering does not exist.

### [Top 5 Innovations Transforming Security Scanners](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/top-5-innovations-transforming-security-scanners.html)

*Like the web itself, security scanners are advancing at a fast pace. Here are the top 5 technologies that leading security professionals are applying to stay ahead of the curve:*

**5. XSS Analyzer**

The "classic" black box approach for detecting XSS relies on sending a bulk of tests based on a “cheat sheet” of around a hundred different payloads. This is a reasonable approach for an automated tool, but it isn’t very sophisticated.

Mimicking a human attacker, **[XSS Analyzer](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/07/announcing-xss-analyzer.html)** is a learning system that follows a disciplined step-by-step approach. XSS Analyzer learns the defense patterns of an application, and finds ways to defeat those defenses. This allows XSS Analyzer to find vulnerabilities that could never be found automatically before, with higher accuracy and less time.

### [String Analysis in AppScan/JSA](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/string-analysis-in-appscanjsa.html)

Let's see how **[String Analysis](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/what-is-string-analysis.html)** is used to improve the accuracy of **[JSA](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/06/by-now-you-have-probably-heard-about-jsa-introduced-inappscan-standard80-in-oct-10-jsa-is-a-component-that-does-static-ana.html)**.

Consider the following real-world example:

var str = document.URL;
 var url\_check = str.indexOf('login.html');
 if (url\_check > -1) {
    result = str.substring(0,url\_check);
    result = result + 'login.jsp' + str.substring((url\_check+search\_term.length), str.length);
    document.URL = result;
 }

Any standard **[taint analysis](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~omertrip/pldi09/paper.pdf)** would argue that this code is vulnerable to **[Open Redirect](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Open_redirect)**, since the value of the untrusted variable "str" flows into the assignment "document.URL = result"; this presumably allows an attacker to control the URL target of a redirect operation, which means that phishing is possible.

However, closer inspection reveals there is no vulnerability here: while part of the target URL can indeed be controlled by an attacker (the request parameters), the *target hostname* of the redirection is beyond the attacker's control.

So what could we do?

### [What is String Analysis? A look at one of AppScan's breakthrough technologies](https://blog.watchfire.com/wfblog/2012/11/what-is-string-analysis.html)

The best technologies are often the ones that you, as a user, never have to worry about. They work automatically, behind the scenes, making a product or service work better. With nothing to configure, nothing new to learn. They just work.

**String Analysis** is such a technology. If you think of it, it's a thing of beauty. Because String Analysis is actually one of the most complicated analysis technologies that IBM (or anyone) has ever developed in the world of static analysis.

# Microsoft Security Bulletin MS11-074 - Important

## Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SharePoint Could Allow Elevation of Privilege (2451858)

Published: September 13, 2011 | Updated: October 11, 2011

**Version:** 1.3

### General Information

#### Executive Summary

This security update resolves five privately reported vulnerabilities and one publicly disclosed vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint and Windows SharePoint Services. The most severe vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if a user clicked on a specially crafted URL or visited a specially crafted Web site. For the most severe vulnerabilities, Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 helps to block the attacks in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.

This security update is rated Important for Microsoft Office Groove 2007, Microsoft SharePoint Workspace 2010, Microsoft Office Forms Server 2007, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2010, Microsoft Office Groove Data Bridge Server 2007, Microsoft Office Groove Management Server 2007, Microsoft Groove Server 2010, Microsoft SharePoint Services 2.0, Microsoft SharePoint Services 3.0, Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010, Microsoft Office Web Apps 2010, and Microsoft Word Web App 2010. For more information, see the subsection, **Affected and Non-Affected Software**, in this section.

The security update addresses the vulnerabilities by modifying the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input, parses malicious XML and XSL files, and handles script contained inside of specific request parameters. For more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) subsection for the specific vulnerability entry under the next section, **Vulnerability Information**.

**Recommendation.** Customers can configure automatic updating to check online for updates from Microsoft Update by using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service. Customers who have automatic updating enabled and configured to check online for updates from Microsoft Update typically will not need to take any action because this security update will be downloaded and installed automatically. Customers who have not enabled automatic updating need to check for updates from Microsoft Update and install this update manually. For information about specific configuration options in automatic updating in supported editions of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 294871](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/294871). For information about automatic updating in supported editions of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2, see [Understanding Windows automatic updating](https://windows.microsoft.com/windows-vista/understanding-windows-automatic-updating).

For administrators and enterprise installations, or end users who want to install this security update manually, Microsoft recommends that customers apply the update at the earliest opportunity using update management software, or by checking for updates using the [Microsoft Update](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40747) service.

See also the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, later in this bulletin.

**Known Issues.** [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2451858](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2451858) documents the currently known issues that customers may experience when installing this security update. The article also documents recommended solutions for these issues. When currently known issues and recommended solutions pertain only to specific releases of this software, this article provides links to further articles.

#### Affected and Non-Affected Software

## XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653

A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 that could result in information disclosure or elevation of privilege if a user clicks a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript elements. Due to the vulnerability, when the malicious JavaScript is echoed back to the user's browser, the resulting page could allow an attacker to issue SharePoint commands in the context of the authenticated user on the targeted SharePoint site.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-0653](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-0653).

#### Mitigating Factors for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site and then convince them to click a specially crafted URL that is used to exploit the vulnerability.
* Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
* An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run when the user clicks a specially crafted URL, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a specially crafted URL that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSSfilter in the Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to enable the XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone. (XSS filter is enabled by default in the Internet security zone.) To do this, perform the following steps:

  1. In Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Enable XSS filter**, click **Enable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

  **Impact of workaround.** Internal sites not previously flagged as being XSS risks could be flagged.

  **How to undo the workaround.**

  To undo this workaround, perform the following steps.

  1. In Internet Explorer 8 or Internet Explorer 9, click **Internet Options** on the **Tools** menu.
  2. Click the **Security** tab.
  3. Click **Local intranet**, and then click **Custom Level**.
  4. Under **Settings**, in the **Scripting** section, under **Enable XSS filter**, click **Disable**, and then click **OK**.
  5. Click **OK** two times to return to Internet Explorer.

#### FAQ for XSS in SharePoint Calendar Vulnerability - CVE-2011-0653

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability that could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft SharePoint does not properly handle malicious JavaScript elements contained within a specially crafted URL, allowing the script to be displayed back to the user's browser.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in the browser of the victim.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted SharePoint site that then displays the script back to the user's browser.

In an e-mail attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an e-mail message containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted SharePoint site and by convincing the user to click on the specially crafted URL.

In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker would have to host a Web site that contains a specially crafted URL to the targeted SharePoint site that is used to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted Web site. Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes them to the attacker's Web site, and then convince them to click on the specially crafted URL.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where users connect to a SharePoint server, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.

**What is the Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9** **Cross-site Scripting** **(XSS) Filter?**

Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. In the case of this vulnerability, you might receive an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted Web site address that includes JavaScript elements. When you click on the URL, you are directed to a legitimate SharePoint site where the attacker-provided script is run. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 include a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 for the Internet Zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting the way that Microsoft SharePoint validates and sanitizes user input.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks and run script in the security context of the logged-on user.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1252](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1252).

#### Mitigating Factors for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability

#### Workarounds for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

Microsoft has not identified any workarounds for this vulnerability.

#### FAQ for HTML Sanitization Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1252

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform persistent cross-site scripting attacks against users of a site that is filtering HTML content via SafeHTML.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

The vulnerability is caused by the way that the SafeHTML function sanitizes HTML.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could perform cross-site scripting attacks against users of a targeted site that uses SafeHTML to sanitize HTML. An attacker could then potentially run script on behalf of a victim user on the site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to submit a specially crafted script to a target site using SafeHTML. Due to the vulnerability, in specific situations the specially crafted script is not properly sanitized, which subsequently could lead to an attacker-supplied script being run in the security context of a user who views the malicious content.

For cross-site scripting attacks, this vulnerability requires that a user be visiting a compromised site for any malicious action to occur. For instance, after an attacker has successfully submitted specially crafted script to the targeted site using SafeHTML, any Web page on that site that contains the specially crafted script is a potential vector for persistent cross-site scripting attacks. When a user visits a Web page that contains the specially crafted script, the script could be run in the security context of the user.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Systems where users connect to a server that uses SafeHTML to sanitize HTML content, such as workstations or terminal servers, are primarily at risk.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that SafeHTML sanitizes HTML content.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

Yes. This vulnerability has been publicly disclosed. It has been assigned Common Vulnerability and Exposure number [CVE-2011-1252](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1252).

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers and had not seen any examples of proof of concept code published when this security bulletin was originally issued.

## Contact Details Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1891

A cross-site scripting vulnerability in Microsoft SharePoint could allow an attacker to gain control over valid user accounts, perform operations on the user's behalf, redirect the user to malicious sites, or steal user credentials.

To view this vulnerability as a standard entry in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list, see [CVE-2011-1891](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1891).

#### Mitigating Factors for Contact Details Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1891

Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability. The following mitigating factors may be helpful in your situation:

* In a Web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a Web site that contains a Web page that is used to exploit this vulnerability. In addition, compromised Web sites and Web sites that accept or host user-provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability. In all cases, however, an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these Web sites. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to visit the Web site, typically by getting them to click a link in an e-mail message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's Web site and then convince them to click a specially crafted URL that is used to exploit the vulnerability.
* Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 users browsing to a SharePoint site in the Internet Zone are at a reduced risk because, by default, the XSS Filter in Internet Explorer 8 prevents this attack in the Internet Zone. The Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS Filter, however, is not enabled by default in the Intranet Zone.
* An attacker can cause arbitrary JavaScript to be run by the user clicking the specially crafted URL, but the attacker would not be able to steal the logged-on user's authentication credentials due to the way that SharePoint Server handles the HttpOnly authentication cookie.
* The vulnerability cannot be exploited automatically through e-mail. For an attack to be successful, a user must click a specially crafted URL that is sent in an e-mail message.

#### Workarounds for Contact Details Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1891

Workaround refers to a setting or configuration change that does not correct the underlying vulnerability but would help block known attack vectors before you apply the update. Microsoft has tested the following workarounds and states in the discussion whether a workaround reduces functionality:

* **Enable Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone**

  You can help protect against exploitation of this vulnerability by changing your settings to enable the XSS filter in the Local intranet security zone (XSS filter is enabled by default in the Internet security zone). To do this, perform the following steps:

#### FAQ for Contact Details Reflected XSS Vulnerability - CVE-2011-1891

**What is the scope of the vulnerability?**

This is a cross-site scripting vulnerability which could result in elevation of privilege or information disclosure.

**What causes the vulnerability?**

This vulnerability is caused by improper input sanitization on specific SharePoint parameters.

**What is cross-site scripting?**

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a class of security vulnerability that can enable an attacker to inject script code into a user's session with a Web site. The vulnerability can affect Web servers that dynamically generate HTML pages. If these servers embed browser input in the dynamic pages that they send back to the browser, these servers can be manipulated to include maliciously supplied content in the dynamic pages. This can allow malicious script to be executed. Web browsers may perpetuate this problem through their assumptions of trusted sites and their use of cookies to maintain persistent state with the Web sites that they frequent. An XSS attack does not modify Web site content. Instead, it inserts new, malicious script that can execute at the browser in the context that is associated with a trusted server.

**What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do?**

To trigger the vulnerability, the user is tricked into visiting a site that will submit a specially crafted form containing malicious script to the vulnerable SharePoint site.

An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could inject script to phish for user credentials or take actions on behalf of the user, such as change permissions and modify or delete content, on a targeted SharePoint site.

**How could an attacker exploit the vulnerability?**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to submit a specially crafted form that sends malicious script to an affected SharePoint 2007 instance.

**What systems are primarily at risk from the vulnerability?**

Client systems that connect to SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2007 servers are at risk from the vulnerability.

**What is the Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9** **Cross-site Scripting** **(XSS) Filter?**

Cross-site scripting attacks try to exploit vulnerabilities in the Web sites you use. In the case of this vulnerability, you might receive an e-mail message that contains a specially crafted Web site address that includes JavaScript elements. When you click on the URL, you are directed to a legitimate SharePoint site where the attacker-provided script is run. Cross-site scripting attacks have emerged as a leading online threat, so Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 include a cross-site scripting filter that can detect these types of attacks and disable the harmful scripts. By default, the cross-site scripting filter is turned on in Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 9 for the Internet Zone.

**What does the update do?**

The update addresses the vulnerability by modifying the way that SharePoint Server handles script requests.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had this vulnerability been publicly disclosed?**

No. Microsoft received information about this vulnerability through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.

**When this security bulletin was issued, had Microsoft received any reports that this vulnerability was being exploited?**

No. Microsoft had not received any information to indicate that this vulnerability had been publicly used to attack customers when this security bulletin was originally issued.

**Removing the Update**

To remove this security update, use the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel.

**Note** When you remove this update, you may be prompted to insert the 2007 Microsoft Office CD in the CD drive. Additionally, you may not have the option to uninstall the update from the Add or Remove Programs tool in Control Panel. There are several possible causes for this issue. For more information about the removal, see [Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 903771](https://support.microsoft.com/kb/903771).

**Verifying that the Update Has Been Applied**

* **Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer**

  To verify that a security update has been applied to an affected system, you may be able to use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) tool. See the section, **Detection and Deployment Tools and Guidance**, earlier in this bulletin for more information.
* **File Version Verification**

  Because there are several editions of Microsoft Windows, the following steps may be different on your system. If they are, see your product documentation to complete these steps.

  1. Click **Start** and then enter an update file name in the **Start Search** box.
  2. When the file appears under **Programs**, right-click the file name and click **Properties**.
  3. On the **General** tab, compare the file size with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Depending on the edition of the operating system, or the programs that are installed on your system, some of the files that are listed in the file information table may not be installed.
  4. You can also click the **Details** tab and compare information, such as file version and date modified, with the file information tables provided in the bulletin KB article.

     **Note** Attributes other than the file version may change during installation. Comparing other file attributes to the information in the file information table is not a supported method of verifying that the update has been applied. Also, in certain cases, files may be renamed during installation. If the file or version information is not present, use one of the other available methods to verify update installation.
  5. Finally, you can also click the **Previous Versions** tab and compare file information for the previous version of the file with the file information for the new, or updated, version of the file.

Integrating Azure AD B2C with App-Owns-Data Embedding

If you're developing with Power BI embedding and targeting external users, you have the flexibility to choose whichever identity provider you'd like to authenticate users and to manage user identity. Azure AD B2C provides a great option because it makes it possible for users to signup using an existing user account while also supporting users that would rather create a new local account during the Azure AD B2C signup process.
Azure AD B2C makes it relatively easy to federate user accounts from other popular social identity providers such as Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and Live.com. Azure AD B2C also makes it possible to support user signup and sign in using organizational accounts from Azure AD tenants. What's more, Azure AD B2C provides rich self-service registration features including email verification and password reset which enables any user with a valid email address to seamlessly signup as a user.
This session walks through creating a new Azure AD B2C tenant and configuring it with user flows and custom policies to support user signup, sign in, profile update and password reset.

Building Multi-language Reports in Power BI

Power BI provides Internationalization and localization features which make it possible to build multi-language reports. For example, you can design a Power BI report that renders in English for some users while rendering in Spanish, French, German or Dutch for other users.
While Power BI provides all the features required to design and implement multi-language reports, the path to success is tricky and not intuitive. The purpose of this Dev Camp session is to explain how to use the Power BI features for Internationalization and localization from the ground up and to provide the guidance for building reports that support multiple languages.
If a company or organization has the requirement of building Power BI reports that support multiple languages, it's no longer necessary to clone and maintain a separate PBIX project file for each language. Instead, they can increase reuse and lower report maintenance by designing and implementing multi-language reports.](https://powerbidevcamp.powerappsportals.com/sessions/session12/)

# Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Microsoft Exploitability Index helps customers prioritize security update deployment by providing information on the likelihood that a vulnerability addressed in a Microsoft security update will be exploited.

## The Microsoft Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index may help customers evaluate risk for a vulnerability. Microsoft evaluates the potential exploitability of each vulnerability associated with a Microsoft security update and then publishes the exploitability information as part of the monthly Microsoft security update details. If after publishing the details Microsoft determines that the Exploitability Index Assessment warrants a change, it will change the assessment and notify customers through technical security notifications. The company will not update the assessment when exploit code is posted that matches the existing exploitability information.

The Exploitability Index uses one of four values to communicate to customers the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, based on the vulnerabilities addressed by the Microsoft security update.

| Exploitability index assessment | Short definition |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Exploitation detected |
| 1 | Exploitation more likely \* |
| 2 | Exploitation less likely \*\* |
| 3 | Exploitation unlikely \*\*\* |

### 0 – Exploitation Detected

Microsoft is aware of an instance of this vulnerability being exploited. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with the highest priority.

### 1 – Exploitation More Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that exploit code could be created in such a way that an attacker could consistently exploit this vulnerability. Moreover, Microsoft is aware of past instances of this type of vulnerability being exploited. This would make it an attractive target for attackers, and therefore more likely that exploits could be created. As such, customers who have reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should treat this with a higher priority.

### 2 – Exploitation Less Likely

Microsoft analysis has shown that while exploit code could be created, an attacker would likely have difficulty creating the code, requiring expertise and/or sophisticated timing, and/or varied results when targeting the affected product. Moreover, Microsoft has not recently observed a trend of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the wild. This makes it a less attractive target for attackers. That said, customers who reviewed the security update and determined its applicability within their environment should still treat this as a material update. If they are prioritizing against other highly exploitable vulnerabilities, they could rank this lower in their deployment priority.

### 3 – Exploitation Unlikely

Microsoft analysis shows that successfully functioning exploit code is unlikely to be utilized in real attacks. This means that while it might be possible for exploit code to be released that could trigger the vulnerability and cause abnormal behavior, the full impact of exploitation will be more limited. Moreover, Microsoft has not observed instances of this type of vulnerability being actively exploited in the past. Thus, the actual risk of being exploited from this vulnerability is significantly lower. Therefore, customers who have reviewed the security update to determine its applicability within their environment could prioritize this update below other vulnerabilities within a release.

In those scenarios where multiple product series are affected, for instance a vulnerability that affects both Windows and Office, the rating reflects the highest risk level across both products. Likewise, the rating reflects the highest risk present across all versions of the product.  In this case, if the Exploitability Assessment on the latest version of Office is "1," and on the latest version of Windows is "2," the rating will reflect "1."  If the XI rating for Windows 10 version 2004 is “2” and the rating for Windows 7 is “1”, the rating will reflect “1”.

## Important Terms and Definitions

**Exploit Code** – A software program or sample code that, when executed against a vulnerable system, uses the vulnerability to spoof attacker identity, tamper with user or system information, repudiate attacker action, disclose user or system information on the server side, deny service to valid users, or elevate privileges for the attacker. For example, if a vulnerability had a security impact of remote code execution, Exploit Code could cause remote code execution to occur when run against a target system.

**Trigger a Vulnerability** – The ability to reach the vulnerable code, but not always achieving the maximum impact. For example, it may be easy to trigger a remote code execution vulnerability, but the resulting effect may only be a denial of service.

* ### What is the Microsoft Exploitability Index?

  The Microsoft Exploitability Index provides additional information to help customers prioritize their deployment of the monthly security updates. Microsoft designed this index to provide customers guidance concerning the likelihood of exploitation, based on each vulnerability addressed by Microsoft security updates.
* ### Why did Microsoft create the Exploitability Index?

  Customers asked for more information to help them prioritize their deployment of Microsoft security updates each month, specifically requesting details about the likelihood of exploitation for the vulnerabilities addressed in security updates. The Exploitability Index provides guidance about the actual risk of exploitation of a vulnerability at the time of the security update’s release.
* ### How are vulnerabilities rated?

  Microsoft Exploitability Index focuses on two aspects of a vulnerability to build its ratings:
  1. Current exploitation trends, based on telemetry data and awareness of exploitation of a particular type of vulnerability in a particular product,
  2. The cost and reliability of building a working exploit for the vulnerability, based on a technical analysis of the vulnerability.
* ### Is this a truly reliable rating system?

  While reliably predicting activity within the security ecosystem is always difficult, there are three reasons why this system should be useful. First, over the last few years we have realized that many security researchers analyze the updates associated with Microsoft's security updates the day they are released to create and evaluate protections. In doing so, many of these researchers also create exploit code to test them. The methodology used to develop this exploit code is like the one Microsoft uses to determine the likelihood of exploit code release. Microsoft analyzes the updates themselves, the nature of the vulnerability, and the conditions that must be met for an exploit to execute successfully. Second, not all vulnerabilities resolved by our security updates are exploited. A vulnerability may well be technically exploitable with a high degree of reliability, but it may never be exploited. We continuously monitor and track exploitation activity to keep up to date with current trends. This in turn informs our opinion of what constitutes a more attractive vulnerability over similar vulnerabilities, and enables us to more accurately communicate an actual risk, rather than a potential one from the vulnerabilities we patch.
  Finally, we are also partnering with protection providers through the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP), working with them to help validate our predictions each month – thereby using a community approach to ensure better accuracy through information sharing.
* ### How is the Exploitability Index different from the Security Update Severity Rating system?

  The Security Update Severity Rating System assumes that exploitation will be successful. For some vulnerabilities where exploitability is high, this assumption is very likely to be true for a broad set of attackers. For other vulnerabilities where exploitability is low, this assumption may only be true when a dedicated attacker puts a lot of resources into ensuring their attack is successful. Regardless of the Severity or Exploitability Index rating, Microsoft always recommends that customers deploy all applicable and available updates; however, this rating information can assist sophisticated customers in prioritizing their approach to each month's release.
* ### How are Denial of Service, Tampering, Information Disclosure, or Spoofing issues rated?

  The Exploitability Index does not differentiate between vulnerability types. It focuses on the likelihood of exploitation of each vulnerability within the range of their full impact potential. Thus, any vulnerability, whether it is Remote Code Execution, Tampering or other, could be rated any of the Exploitability Index ratings.
* ### What happens when newly emerging information requires an update to the Exploitability Index rating?

  The ability to rate the possible exploitation of vulnerabilities is an evolving science, and new techniques for exploitation in general, or unique techniques specific to a vulnerability, or new trends in detected exploits of particular products may be discovered that could change the Exploitability Index rating. However, the goal of the Exploitability Index is to help customers prioritize those updates for the most current monthly release. Therefore, if there is information that would change an assessment released in the first month of a security release, Microsoft will update the Exploitability Index. If information becomes available in subsequent months, after most customers have made their prioritization decisions, the Exploitability Index will not be updated as it is no longer useful to the customer. When an Exploitability Index rating is corrected in a way that reflects increased risk to customers, the security update revision is incremented at a major version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 2.0). When risk is adjusted downwards, the update revision is incremented at a minor version number (for instance, from 1.0 to 1.1).
* ### How does the Exploitability Index relate to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and other rating systems?

  The Exploitability Index is separate and not related to other rating systems. However, the MSRC is a contributing member to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), and Microsoft shares its experience and customer feedback in building and releasing the Exploitability Index with the working group in order to help ensure the CVSS is effective and actionable.
