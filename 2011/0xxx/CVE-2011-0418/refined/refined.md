  "cve_id": "CVE-2011-0418",
  "description": "Multiple libc/glob(3) flaws were reported that affect various *BSD libc implementations. In particular, globs containing braces could lead to resource exhaustion. One such vulnerable application is Pure-FTPd. This has been corrected in upstream version 1.0.32, where support for braces expansion in directory listings was disabled.",
  "affected_versions": [],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `glob` function in the libc library of NetBSD and other *BSD systems was vulnerable to resource exhaustion due to excessive memory allocation and processing during brace expansion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Insufficient Limits",
	  "Denial of Service"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service by providing specially crafted glob patterns with excessive brace expansions, leading to memory exhaustion and potentially crashing vulnerable applications.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
	"required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted glob pattern string to the vulnerable application.  In the case of pure-ftpd this could be done by providing a malicious file/directory listing request."
  },
  "fixes": [
    {
      "commit": "https://cvsweb.netbsd.org/bsdweb.cgi/src/lib/libc/gen/glob.c?rev=1.28",
      "description": "The fix involves adding limits to the brace expansion functionality within the glob function, preventing excessive recursion and resource consumption, as well as setting limits to prevent uncontrolled consumption of memory by limiting the path length."
