Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2011-0707:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `mail.python.org`, `lists.opensuse.org`, `www.ubuntu.com`, and `www.debian.org` explicitly mention `CVE-2011-0707` and its relationship to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mailman.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper sanitization of certain fields in Mailman, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs due to insufficient validation and encoding of user-controlled input when constructing HTML output, particularly in confirmation messages.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of XSS vulnerabilities. This means that an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the web pages generated by Mailman.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:**  An attacker could exploit the XSS vulnerability to steal session cookies of users, allowing them to impersonate those users.
*   **Content Modification:**  Attackers could modify the content displayed on the Mailman web interface.
*   **Data Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal confidential data displayed within the same domain, though this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided material.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted requests to the Mailman server.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by manipulating user input that is reflected in the Mailman web interface, particularly in confirmation messages and administrative interfaces.
*   The attack can be carried out by tricking a user into viewing server output during a malicious request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** An attacker can be remote, as the attack vector is through HTTP requests.
*   **Crafted Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious HTTP requests that contain the malicious script in a way that the Mailman server will include them in the generated HTML pages without proper sanitization.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to visit a malicious link or view content with the injected malicious script for the attack to be successful.

**Technical Details & Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability affects Mailman versions 2.1.14 and prior.
*   The fix involves updating to version 2.1.14 of Mailman and includes improved character encoding of HTML output and more thorough input sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
*   The patch affects a single module of Mailman and can be applied without requiring a restart.
*   Several sources state that the vulnerability allows the retrieval of session cookies by injecting crafted JavaScript into confirmation messages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Some sources, like Ubuntu's security notice, also mention CVE-2010-3089 being related, indicating the vulnerabilities were sometimes exploited together.
*   The `lists.opensuse.org` content mentions CVE-2010-3090 being related as well.

In summary, CVE-2011-0707 describes an XSS vulnerability in Mailman, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking, content modification, and data theft by exploiting the lack of proper input sanitization.
