Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0926:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `CSDWebInstaller.ocx` ActiveX control of Cisco Secure Desktop.
*   The vulnerable ActiveX control improperly verifies the digital signature of an executable file that it downloads and executes as part of the Cisco Secure Desktop installation process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Digital Signature Verification:** The core issue is that while the ActiveX control verifies the signing authority names in the certificate chain, it fails to properly validate the digital signature of the downloaded executable.
*  **Unsigned Code Execution:** This allows the execution of arbitrary code since the application is not verifying the digital signature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system within the context of the browser.
*   **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete system compromise, allowing attackers to perform a wide range of malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** An attacker could host a malicious web page that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker could craft a malicious file that, when opened, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   **User Interaction Required:** The attacker needs to trick the target user into visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. The user does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional details:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) disclosed this vulnerability publicly without a patch due to their 180-day deadline policy.
*   Cisco stated that they would have a patch for this issue on March 31st, 2011.
*   Mitigation measures included setting a killbit on the vulnerable ActiveX control to disable it in Internet Explorer through a registry modification.
*   Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers were protected by a Digital Vaccine filter with ID '8247'.
