Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-0364

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the `webagent.exe` component of the Cisco Security Agent Management Console. This component handles requests from an Apache instance listening on TCP port 443.
- The root cause is improper validation of POST parameters during the handling of `st_upload` requests. Specifically, the application fails to properly validate parameters used for file creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Creation:** The application allows an attacker to control both the filename and content of a newly created file due to insufficient validation of POST parameters in `st_upload` requests.
- **Lack of Authentication:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication, making it easily accessible to remote attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **System-Level Privilege:** The code execution occurs under the context of the SYSTEM user, granting the attacker complete control over the compromised machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based Attack:** The attack vector is network-based, where a remote attacker sends crafted HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable server.
- **Specifically crafted `st_upload` request**: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request containing malicious filename and file content via the `st_upload` request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server, specifically to TCP port 443, where the Apache instance is listening.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any credentials or prior access to the system to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco on 2010-09-23.
- Cisco released an update to address this vulnerability on 2011-02-16.
- The vulnerability affects the Security Agent Management Console.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 10.0, indicating its critical severity.
