Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory corruption issue in QuickTime's handling of image descriptions within QuickTime movie files. Specifically, it occurs while parsing the video description table, where the size field preceding the 'mp4v' tag is used to allocate a buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The core weakness is a memory corruption issue that arises during the processing of the 'mp4v' codec information.
- **Lack of Size Checking:** After allocating and copying data into the buffer, the code performs endian changes on a fixed portion of the buffer without proper bounds checking, leading to a potential buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary code execution:** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Application termination:**  The vulnerability can also cause unexpected application termination.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Movie File:** The primary attack vector involves the user opening a specially crafted QuickTime movie file containing the malicious 'mp4v' atom.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required because the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious movie file containing a crafted 'mp4v' atom and make it accessible to the victim, either through a website or other means.
-  No special privileges or specific network positions are mentioned as requirements for exploitation.

**Additional details from Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative:**
- The vulnerability affects Apple QuickTime.
- The vulnerability is triggered while parsing the video description table and handling 'mp4v' codec information.
- After allocating memory based on the 'size' field preceding the 'mp4v' tag, endian changes are made on a fixed portion without checking if the allocated buffer is large enough.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS score of 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P).
- A patch has been issued by Apple to fix the vulnerability.
- TippingPoint IPS customers are protected via a specific filter ID.
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple on 2011-06-03.
- The coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2011-08-31.
