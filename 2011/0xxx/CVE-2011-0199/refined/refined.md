The provided document contains information about multiple CVEs, including CVE-2011-0199.

**CVE-2011-0199**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error handling issue exists in the Certificate Trust Policy. Specifically, if an Extended Validation (EV) certificate lacks an OCSP URL, and CRL checking is enabled, the CRL will not be checked and a revoked certificate may be accepted as valid.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation of certificate revocation status due to missing OCSP URL and enabled CRL checking, allowing revoked certificates to be treated as valid.
*  **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a privileged network position may intercept user credentials or other sensitive information by presenting a revoked certificate that is improperly accepted.
*   **Attack vectors**: A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, where an attacker intercepts network traffic and presents a revoked certificate.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs a privileged network position to perform a MitM attack and needs to present a revoked certificate.
