 **Firefly with CUDA-enabled MP4 code is now available for Linux**

Alex Granovsky

gran@classic.chem.msu.su

---

Dear Firefly users,

those of you who are interested to try CUDA-enabled Linux binaries
of current Firefly v. 8.0.0 beta, please contact me directly off
the list for details on how to get access to prerelease binaries.

Best regards,
Alex Granovsky

P.S. Working on the Linux port of our MP4/CUDA code initially
developed a year ago for Windows version, we unexpectedly found
that (unlike Windowd CUDA implementation), cudaHostAlloc/cuMemHostAlloc
CUDA API calls return ***non-initialized pinned memory***.
Depending on how exactly this pinned memory is allocated by CUDA
runtime/CUDA driver, this may be the serious system-wide security
hole potentially allowing one to examine regions of memory previously
used by other programs and Linux kernel itself. We are now in contact
with NVidia trying to clarify as much details on this problem as
possible. Meanwhile, we'd recommend everybody to stop running CUDA
drivers on any multiuser Linux system.

 **Re^3: Firefly with CUDA-enabled MP4 code is now available for Linux - follow-up on CUDA security hole**

Alex Granovsky

gran@classic.chem.msu.su

Some more updates:

Last Friday to Monday, in a series of private emails Nvidia
finally confirmed that this is a serious security issue.
Nvidia is now working to provide solution to this problem.
However, it seems that Nvidia will not release any security
advisory on this bug, nor it likes the idea the information
on this bug to become publicly available.

Regards,
Alex Granovsky

For reference purposes, here is the info on CUDA driver version:

devdriver_3.2_linux_64_260.19.26.run

and Linux version:

OpenSuSE 11.3 x64, uname -a:

Linux phen 2.6.34-12-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT 2010-06-29 02:39:08 +0200 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Dear All,

>P.S. Working on the Linux port of our MP4/CUDA code initially
>developed a year ago for Windows version, we unexpectedly found
>that (unlike Windowd CUDA implementation), cudaHostAlloc/cuMemHostAlloc
>CUDA API calls return ***non-initialized pinned memory***.
>Depending on how exactly this pinned memory is allocated by CUDA
>runtime/CUDA driver, this may be the serious system-wide security
>hole potentially allowing one to examine regions of memory previously
>used by other programs and Linux kernel itself. We are now in contact
>with NVidia trying to clarify as much details on this problem as
>possible. Meanwhile, we'd recommend everybody to stop running CUDA
>drivers on any multiuser Linux system.

After some more tests, we can confirm this is indeed the
very serious security hole. E.g, we were able to examine contents
of pages evicted from Linux file cache using this hole.

```

For reference purposes, here is the info on CUDA driver version:

devdriver_3.2_linux_64_260.19.26.run

and Linux version:

OpenSuSE 11.3 x64, uname -a:

Linux phen 2.6.34-12-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT 2010-06-29 02:39:08 +0200 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

```

Regards,
Alex Granovsky

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

 **Re^2: Firefly with CUDA-enabled MP4 code is now available for Linux - follow-up on CUDA security hole**

Alex Granovsky

gran@classic.chem.msu.su

---

The issue is very serious as CUDA functionality is built in into
every (relatively recent) version of Nvidia graphics drivers for
Windows, Linux and OSX. Moreover, to install CUDA toolkit (all that
is needed to exploit this bug) one does not need any special
privileges so everybody having access to system with Nvidia video
drivers running can do this.

After toolkit installation, one just need to write simple C program
which calls cudaHostAlloc() to allocate sufficiently large piece of
pinned memory, and then dump all non-zero content to HDD for later
examination. One can do this on a timely fashion gathering more and
more information.

As an example, our simplest "proof of concept" program was able to
catch large fragments of files (or even entire files) being written or
read by other users - emails, documents, various system logs, inputs,
outputs, etc... - virtually everything one can imagine to find in the
OS file cache and in the released memory of other programs.

It seems the bug was here from the first days of CUDA. It does not
exist under Windows (my Microsoft's contacts pointed me out that
Windows forcibly zeroes any memory exported to user space so most
likely this is the reason why it is not here), and I have not checked
OSX as of yet.

However, every owner of Nvidia graphics card running Linux and Nvidia
graphics drivers should now consider switching to Nouveau driver, or
even to GPUs of other vendors (or maybe to Windows OS :) ).

As to Nvidia's response, it was really strange - their point
was that if application does not like its data to be visible by
other programs/users via this security issue, it should explicitly
clear data in memory before releasing it. This is really strange and
absolutely wrong idea, moreover, the contents of OS file cache,
unused physical memory etc... cannot be cleared from within user
programs at all.

More globally, this is a question of how trustworthy are all
third-party proprietary drivers which are capable to expose
memory into user space.

For reference purposes, here is the info on CUDA driver version:

devdriver_3.2_linux_64_260.19.26.run

and Linux version:

OpenSuSE 11.3 x64, uname -a:

Linux phen 2.6.34-12-desktop #1 SMP PREEMPT 2010-06-29 02:39:08 +0200 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
