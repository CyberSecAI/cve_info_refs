The provided content is related to CVE-2011-0636.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the `cudaHostAlloc` and `cuMemHostAlloc` CUDA API calls returning non-initialized pinned memory on Linux systems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The CUDA driver implementation on Linux does not zero out pinned memory before returning it to the user.
- This allows a malicious program to potentially access sensitive data left in previously used memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker can gain access to sensitive information such as:
  - Fragments or entire files being written or read by other users
  - Emails
  - Documents
  - System logs
  - Inputs, outputs
  - Contents of the OS file cache
  - Unused physical memory

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to:
  1. Have local access to a Linux system with NVIDIA video drivers installed.
  2. Install the CUDA toolkit (no special privileges needed).
  3. Write a program that calls `cudaHostAlloc()` to allocate a sufficiently large piece of pinned memory.
  4. Dump the non-zero content of this memory to disk for later examination.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to a vulnerable Linux system with NVIDIA video drivers.
- Ability to install the CUDA toolkit.
- Ability to execute code on the system.
