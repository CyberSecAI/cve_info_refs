Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0463:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the OCFS2 filesystem not properly handling memory clearing when writing file holes that span across page boundaries. Specifically, when a hole (a region of a file that contains no data) extends across the boundary of a memory page, the subsequent write operation could result in reading uninitialized data (garbage data) from the disk instead of treating it as a new write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper memory handling:** The core issue lies in the way OCFS2 manages writes when holes span page boundaries. Instead of initializing the new page with zeros, it might read existing (and potentially sensitive) data from the disk.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of uninitialized disk data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loss of Privacy:** A successful exploit can allow a local attacker to read potentially sensitive data from the disk that was not intended to be exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack requires a local attacker who has the ability to create files and write to them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system and the ability to create and write files on an OCFS2 filesystem.
*   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create files with holes that span page boundaries.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided patch addresses this by marking writes as "new" when holes span page boundaries, forcing the write operation to clear the memory properly.
*   The Ubuntu security notice (USN-1146-1) confirms the vulnerability and states, "Goldwyn Rodrigues discovered that the OCFS2 filesystem did not correctly clear memory when writing certain file holes. A local attacker could exploit this to read uninitialized data from the disk, leading to a loss of privacy."
*   The Ubuntu notice also lists the vulnerable package as "linux".
*   The vulnerability was patched in the Linux kernel.

In summary, CVE-2011-0463 is a local information disclosure vulnerability in the OCFS2 filesystem, where an attacker can read uninitialized data from the disk by writing to files with holes spanning page boundaries. The fix involves correctly marking writes as "new" in such cases to ensure proper memory initialization.
