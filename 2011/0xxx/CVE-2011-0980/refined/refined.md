{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused when Microsoft Excel does not properly manage data structures while parsing a specially crafted Excel file. Specifically, when parsing a document with a malformed office art object, the application adds the malformed object to a linked list. During the processing of each element, the application explicitly trusts a function pointer off of this object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Dangling pointer vulnerability",
      "Improper handling of data structures",
      "Unvalidated function pointer usage"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the logged-on user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted Excel file received via email",
      "Visiting a malicious website hosting the crafted Excel file"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious Excel file that triggers the vulnerability. They then need to convince a user to open the file using a vulnerable version of Microsoft Excel. This can be done through social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails or malicious links on compromised websites."
