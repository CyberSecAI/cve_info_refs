  "CVE-2011-0703": {
    "description": "In gksu-polkit before 0.0.3, the source file for xauth may contain arbitrary commands that may allow an attacker to overtake an administrator X11 session.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in how gksu-polkit handles the xauth source file. The source file may contain arbitrary commands, which are then executed by the system when an administrator X11 session is established.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insecure handling of user supplied data"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of an administrator by injecting them into the xauth source file and taking over the X11 session. This can lead to full control of the system.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the source file used by xauth when establishing an administrator X11 session.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to influence the content of the xauth source file."
