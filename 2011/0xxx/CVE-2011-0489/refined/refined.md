Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0489:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Objectivity/DB administration tools lack authentication. This means that the tools do not require any form of verification (such as username and password) before they can be used to perform operations on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Authentication:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of any authentication mechanism for the administrative tools. This allows anyone with network access to these tools to execute commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker can remotely execute commands on the database server. This could lead to various malicious activities.
*   **Compromised Data:** An attacker could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored in the database.
*   **System Disruption:** The attacker can use the tools to stop or kill the lock and advanced multithreaded servers which would cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by attackers with network access to the vulnerable Objectivity/DB server.
*   **Custom Scripts:** Attackers can use custom scripts or tools to emulate the functionality of the administrative tools and execute commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server hosting Objectivity/DB.
*   **No Credentials Required:** No authentication credentials are required to use the vulnerable administration tools.
*   **Understanding of the Protocol:** The attacker needs to understand or replicate the protocol of the administrative tools to send commands. The exploit code provides example for killing specific services, which means that an attacker can likely extend that functionality to other commands as well.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the design of the Objectivity/DB administrative tools.
*   The vendor did not provide a fix.
*   The CERT vulnerability note suggests filtering ports 6779 and 6780 as a temporary solution.

The provided exploit code demonstrates how an attacker can kill the "advanced multithreaded server" (port 6779) and the "lock server" (port 6780). The exploit code also notes there are other administrative tools that could allow more interesting tasks.
