Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-0442:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an internally developed service utility within EMC Avamar that transmits sensitive customer information in clear text. This transmission occurs during normal operations to other internal EMC systems and potentially within customer-configured emails notifying about certain events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Clear Text Transmission:** The service utility transmits sensitive data without encryption. This exposes the data to interception and unauthorized access.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive customer information is disclosed within service requests and potentially in customer emails.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Sensitive customer information can be exposed, potentially leading to identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities.
*   **High Severity:** The vulnerability was initially rated as high with a CVSS v2 base score of 8.5 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker who is positioned to monitor network traffic can intercept the unencrypted data.
*   **Email Interception:** An attacker who gains access to a customer's email or the server processing these emails can read the disclosed information.
*   **Internal System Compromise:** Attackers with access to EMC internal systems where the data is transmitted could also gain access to the sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to eavesdrop on the network traffic between Avamar and EMC's internal systems.
*   **Access to Emails:** An attacker needs access to the emails generated by the system to read the sensitive info that may be contained within.
*   **Authentication:** The initial CVSS score indicates single time authentication is needed (Au:S).
*   **Internal Access (Potentially):**  An attacker may need to have access to EMC internal systems to exploit this.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** EMC Avamar 5.0.0-407 and later, but prior to 5.0.4 (v5.0 SP4).
*   **Resolution:** The vulnerability was resolved in Avamar 5.0 SP4 and earlier versions with hotfix 24753 applied.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability was mapped to CWE-310 (Cryptographic Issues).
