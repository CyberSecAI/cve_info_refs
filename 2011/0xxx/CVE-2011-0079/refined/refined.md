Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2011-0079**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A compartment mismatch during exception handling in the JavaScript engine. When an exception occurred, the exception object kept a list of argument values from the JavaScript stack frames. These values could belong to different compartments than the exception itself, and they were not properly wrapped which lead to accessing invalid memory
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Access of  memory that belongs to a different compartment, leading to a crash.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Crash of the application due to invalid memory access.
*   **Attack vectors:** Triggering a specific code path in the JavaScript engine that throws an exception which causes the vulnerability to trigger. Specific add-ons (TestPilot) can tickle the bug, but it is within the core JavaScript engine.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to execute JavaScript code within the browser. No special permissions needed.

**CVE-2011-0079** (Additional notes)
The vulnerability was exposed due to a regression introduced by a changeset. The crash signature was `js::Shape::trace(JSTracer*)` and `js::Shape::trace`. The fix involves a simple patch in `js/src/jsscope.cpp`. The bug was a top crasher and considered a security risk that needed to be addressed in a point release (4.0.1). The root cause was identified as a compartment mismatch, where an exception object would hold argument values that could belong to different compartments leading to accessing invalid memory.

**CVE-2011-0079 Related to Bug 639885**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An access-after-free vulnerability occurs due to a race condition between the main thread and a task thread within the D3D10 graphics layer, resulting in memory corruption via `memmove`. Specifically, the `ReadbackManagerD3D10` object was being accessed by the task thread after it has already been deallocated.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Write-after-free. Double-free. Use of named objects can also lead to problems.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Memory corruption leading to a crash and potentially exploitable through overwriting of vtables.
*   **Attack vectors:** This issue can be triggered by running multiple instances of Firefox with windowless plugins. The root cause is a race condition where the task thread of the ReadbackManagerD3D10 attempts to process tasks after the main thread has terminated it. This is exposed by the use of named system objects.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires the ability to open two or more firefox instances and load sites with windowless plugins and have the system crash during the closing of the instance that loaded the site first.

**CVE-2011-0079 Related to Bug 639343**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of out-of-bounds access on typed arrays in the tracing JIT and methodjit, where they looked up the prototype chain. The bug was triggered by a LIR type error that happened when accessing a typed array out of range
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** LIR type error that results from out-of-bounds array access.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Crash or assertion failure due to the type mismatch and incorrect memory access. This can be security risk.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Executing a specially crafted JavaScript code that creates and accesses out-of-bounds indexes on a typed array. This could happen on a normal page.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to execute javascript code. No special privileges are needed.

**CVE-2011-0079 Related to Bug 643649**
*  **Root cause of vulnerability:**  Incorrect size is passed to `RegEnumValueW` in `gfxGDIFontList::GetFontSubstitutes`. The length passed was in bytes not characters leading to buffer overflow.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Buffer overflow by miscalculating the size of the buffer.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Memory corruption due to writing past the bounds of the buffer, which could lead to a crash or potentially exploitable.
*   **Attack vectors:** Inserting a long string in the registry as a font substitute to force the buffer overflow.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  Ability to modify the system registry on a Windows machine.

**CVE-2011-0079 Related to Bug 641388**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of object lifetime with the refresh driver resulting in a use-after-free.  When SMIL animation is used, the `nsSMILAnimationController` may be destroyed before being unregistered as a refresh observer, leading to a crash when the refresh driver tries to notify the dead observer.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Application crash. The vulnerability can potentially expose memory after it has been freed.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Triggering an SVG animation with SMIL, where the SVG document is dynamically created and destroyed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to control the content of a webpage which contains a combination of SMIL and SVG.

**CVE-2011-0079 Related to Bug 639728**
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in SVG list handling. During garbage collection, references to SVG list items were not handled correctly, leading to the use of a freed pointer. This can happen when the list itself is being modified and when references to items in the list persist after list removal.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free due to missing reference counting for the lifetime of the list item objects during list modification, specifically in `DOMSVGPathSegList::ItemAt`.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Crash due to invalid memory access.
*   **Attack vectors:**  Specially crafted SVG that manipulates list objects through script, while triggering garbage collection. This can be triggered by manipulating an attribute of a svg object or an item in a list after that list is removed.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The ability to control the content of a web page that contains a specific kind of SVG animation, especially if it can control when garbage collection happens.

**CVE-2011-0079 Related to Bug 642717**
*  **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The refresh driver was using weak references to the event targets, but these targets could be collected before the event is dispatched.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper use of weak references.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Use-after-free, crash of the application due to using a pointer to an object that has been freed.
*   **Attack vectors:** Creating and destroying document elements, which results in invalidating weak references, and then a refresh driver tries to dispatch events to the already-destroyed elements.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to control the creation and destruction of a webpage.

In summary, CVE-2011-0079 covers a range of memory safety vulnerabilities in the Firefox browser, most of which stem from improper handling of object lifetimes, reference counting, and memory access, particularly in the JavaScript engine, graphics, layout, and SVG components. These vulnerabilities could be triggered by various means, including crafted web pages, malformed data in the registry, and specially designed use-cases.
