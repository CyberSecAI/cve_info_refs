Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the "FTP-Server" field when editing FTP options. This input is then written to the `config/custom/base.ini.php` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize the "FTP-Server" field input before writing it to a configuration file.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By injecting malicious PHP code into the `ftpserver` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/simploo/index.php/sicore/updates/optionssave` endpoint.
- **Malicious Input:** The malicious PHP code is injected via the `ftpserver` parameter within the POST request data.
- **Direct File Access:** The attacker can trigger the execution of the injected PHP code by directly accessing the modified configuration file (`http://localhost/simploo/config/custom/base.ini.php`) with an additional parameter `x` which is used to inject php code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must have "write" privileges to access and modify the FTP options.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send HTTP requests.

**Additional Details:**

- The advisory was published 6 months after the vulnerability was reported to the vendor.
- The proof of concept shows a specific example of how to exploit the vulnerability and execute the `phpinfo()` function.
- The solution recommends sanitizing user input.

This information is consistent with the provided CVE description, which mentions a lack of input sanitization leading to code execution, but this exploit-db entry provides additional technical details and a proof-of-concept, making it more useful.
