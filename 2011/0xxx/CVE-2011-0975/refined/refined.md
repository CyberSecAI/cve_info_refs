  "CVE-2011-0975": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of BMC Perform Agent. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the service daemon which listens by default on TCP port 6768. When processing the BGS_MULTIPLE_READS commands a user-supplied length value is trusted and utilized in reading arbitrary data into a stack buffer. By providing large enough values a remote attacker can abuse this to execute remote code under the context of the SYSTEM user.",
    "Root cause": "A user-supplied length value is trusted and used in reading data into a stack buffer, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution with SYSTEM privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted BGS_MULTIPLE_READS command with a large length value to TCP port 6768.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker must be able to send network traffic to port 6768 of the target machine. No authentication is needed."
