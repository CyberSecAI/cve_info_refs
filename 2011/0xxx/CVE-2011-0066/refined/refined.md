{
  "cveId": "CVE-2011-0066",
  "description": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue in the handling of observer OBJECTs in Mozilla Firefox and other products based on it like Iceape and Icedove. Specifically, when an observer OBJECT is removed from the mObserverList during an iteration of the LOOP_OVER_OBSERVERS macro, it leads to a heap spray over |mObserverList.mNext|, potentially allowing an attacker to change the execution flow and execute arbitrary code.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The root cause is the improper handling of object removal during iteration of the mObserverList, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Dangling pointer",
      "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially gain control of the affected system by exploiting this vulnerability.",
    "attackVector": "The attack vector is remote. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious webpage or file that, when opened by a vulnerable browser, triggers the use-after-free condition.",
    "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to craft malicious web content or files and have the user interact with the malicious content via a vulnerable application (e.g. opening a malicous webpage in firefox)."
