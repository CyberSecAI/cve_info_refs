The description, from segooon, follows:

Binary package hint: feh

Hi, I've just discovered that feh is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

      tmpname_timestamper =
         estrjoin("", "/tmp/feh_", cppid, "_", basename, NULL);
....
            execlp("wget", "wget", "-N", "-O", tmpname_timestamper, newurl,
                   quiet, (char*) NULL);

If attacker knows PID of feh and knows the URL, it can create the link to any user file. wget would overwrite it.

Thanks.

Hi,

feh 1.12 has just been released, which fixes this bug by switching from wget
to mkstemp + libcurl.

Hi, if the security team confirms that the vulnerability is really
fixed in feh version 1.12, I think that this bug report should be
closed as fixed in feh/1.12-1 ...

Or am I wrong?

Hi,

as Francesco correctly pointed out this bug should be closed (just
forgot to mention it in the changelog).  Thanks for the hint

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9)
squeeze (6.0.2)

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help or lack time. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

Hi,

I attached two debdiff files which should fullfill the requirement of a
"smallest possible patch".  Here I'm quoting the upstream author for a
description of the patch (which is included in the quilt based packaging
of 1.8 in the patch description as well):

<snip>
The original fix for this was switching from wget to libcurl, which (I
presume) is not possible in this case. Because of that, I changed feh to
create a temporary directory inside /tmp for its files.

mkdir itself will fail if the directory already exists (or is a
symlink).  Thanks to the mode of 0700, if mkdir succeeds, we can be
certain that the directory is empty and completely under our control.
wget, when callled by feh, will save its files inside that directory, so
there should be no way for an attacker to make wget save to symlinks.

There are no Backwards Compatibility problems: While I did change the
location of the temporary files, these are removed once feh exits
anyways.

If the user tells feh to keep its temporary files, they are saved in the
current working directory by default; that behaviour is not affected by
this patch.
</snip>

Feel free to upload this directly whereever it belongs to because I
will not be able to do this over the weekend.  Moreover I do not have
accordig Lenny / Squeeze chroots to build the packages in and thus
I'd prefer if somebody else could do the upload.

Kind regards

       Andreas.

the attached patches (created against the unpatched 1.3.4.dfsg.1-1 / 1.8-1
packages) use mkdtemp for the fix.

I removed the --cache 0 wget argument because my system's wget does not support
it anymore, if the wget in oldstable still has it it's safe to put that back in.

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

squeeze (6.0.6) - use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track [1] the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [2] and my blog post [3].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=676389#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-02-09 17:29:49 UTC  ``` A Debian bug report [1],[2] indicated that feh is vulnerable to an arbitrary file overwrite flaw.  If a user could guess the PID of the feh process and create a symlink in /tmp, they could cause the overwrite of any file that the user running feh has write access to via wget overwriting the file.  In src/imlib.c we have:  235 char *feh_http_load_image(char *url) 236 { 237     char *tmpname; 238     char *basename; 239     char *path = NULL; 240  241     if (opt.keep_http) { 242         if (opt.output_dir) 243             path = opt.output_dir; 244         else  245             path = ""; 246     } else 247         path = "/tmp/"; 248 249     basename = strrchr(url, '/') + 1; 250     tmpname = feh_unique_filename(path, basename); ... 455             execlp("wget", "wget", "--cache=off", "-O", tmpname, url, quiet, NULL);  and in src/utils.c we have:  162 char *feh_unique_filename(char *path, char *basename) 163 { ... 170  171     /* Massive paranoia ;) */ 172     if (i > 999998) 173         i = 1; 174  175     ppid = getpid(); 176     snprintf(cppid, sizeof(cppid), "%06ld", (long) ppid); 177  178     /* make sure file doesn't exist */ 179     do { 180         snprintf(num, sizeof(num), "%06ld", i++); 181         tmpname = estrjoin("", path, "feh_", cppid, "_", num, "_", basename, NULL); 182     } 18     while (stat(tmpname, &st) == 0); 184     return(tmpname); 185 }  feh_unique_filename() has some attempt at randomness, but I don't think it's enough.  i always starts at 1, so unless the same process is creating multiple temporary files, you're almost guaranteed to have that extra randomness being '1'; it's also just as easy to create a bunch of symlinks to account for the "randomness" provided you know the PID.  Using mkstemp would be a much better solution.

Subject: CVE request for feh

Hi,

I guess there is no CVE request for this one yet:

On [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/feh/+bug/607328](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/feh/%2Bbug/607328) seegooon wrote:

--------------------------------------------------
Hi, I've just discovered that feh is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

      tmpname_timestamper =
         estrjoin("", "/tmp/feh_", cppid, "_", basename, NULL);
...
            execlp("wget", "wget", "-N", "-O", tmpname_timestamper, newurl,
                   quiet, (char*) NULL);

If attacker knows PID of feh and knows the URL, it can create the link
to any user file. wget would overwrite it.

Thanks in advance,

Craig

### Bug Description

Binary package hint: feh

Hi, I've just discovered that feh is vulnerable to rewriting any user file:

tmpname\_timestamper =

         estrjoin("", "/tmp/feh\_", cppid, "\_", basename, NULL);

...

            execlp("wget", "wget", "-N", "-O", tmpname\_timestamper, newurl,

                   quiet, (char\*) NULL);

If attacker knows PID of feh and knows the URL, it can create the link to any user file. wget would overwrite it.

Thanks.

Thanks for taking the time to report this bug and helping to make Ubuntu better.

The latest release of Ubuntu is not vulnerable to symlink race attack, but earlier release will need fixing. <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#symlink>

Since the package referred to in this bug is in universe or multiverse, it is community maintained. If you are able, I suggest posting a debdiff for this issue. When a debdiff is available, members of the security team will review it and publish the package. See the following link for more information: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/UpdateProcedures>
