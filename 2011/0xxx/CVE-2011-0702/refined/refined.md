Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-0702:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `feh` creates temporary files when downloading images via HTTP. It uses `wget` and constructs a temporary filename in `/tmp` based on the process ID (PID), and a counter, but does not ensure that the directory to hold the downloaded files are not already in use by another process or that they are not symlinks. An attacker knowing the PID of the `feh` process and the target URL could create a symlink in `/tmp` that would cause `wget` to overwrite an arbitrary file that the user running feh has write permissions to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:**  The `feh` application constructs temporary file names in an insecure way using the PID and an incrementing counter, which an attacker can predict.
*   **Symlink Following:** The application does not verify that the target of the `/tmp` directory entry is a valid directory or an invalid symlink target, and will follow symlinks when creating the file using wget.
*   **Use of wget without `--no-clobber`:** The `wget` command was used without the `--no-clobber` option, causing it to overwrite the target if it existed. This was later changed to the use of `mkdtemp` to create a directory and avoid this issue in point releases for affected versions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to overwrite any file on the system that the user running `feh` has write access to. This can lead to:
    *   Data loss
    *   Privilege escalation if configuration files or executable files are targeted
    *   System compromise if critical system files are overwritten

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to be on the same system as the user running `feh`.
*   **PID Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the process ID (PID) of the running `feh` process.
*   **File System Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to create symlinks in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious URL to `feh` that is then downloaded using `wget`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user or have gained some local access to the system.
*   **Ability to Create Symlinks:** The attacker needs to be able to create symbolic links in the `/tmp` directory.
*   **Knowledge of PID:** The attacker needs to know the PID of the target `feh` process, which may be obtained via some other vector prior to attack.
*   **Network Access** Ability to serve a malicious URL to the target.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was initially reported in Ubuntu and Debian bug trackers before being assigned CVE-2011-0702.
*   The fix initially involved using `wget --no-clobber`, but was later improved to using `mkstemp` and `libcurl`.
*   Multiple distributions, including Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora, were affected.
*   Red Hat also tracked this issue under their own bug tracker.

This vulnerability allows for a local user to achieve privilege escalation if writable files in a higher privilege user space can be overwritten using this method. The reports show that the fix was applied by changing the temp file creation method and removing reliance on wget to use libcurl instead.
