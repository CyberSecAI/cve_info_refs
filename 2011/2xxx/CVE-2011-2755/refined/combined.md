## ManageEngine ServiceDesk directory traversal vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#543310

Original Release Date: 2011-06-27 | Last Revised: 2011-06-27

---

### Overview

ManageEngine ServiceDesk contains a directory traversal vulnerability which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to obtain sensitive information.

### Description

| ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus 8.0, and possibly prior versions, contains a directory traversal vulnerability in the FileDownload.jsp page caused by an input validation error when handling requests. Additionally, ServiceDesk Plus 8.0 fails to verify that requests to the FileDownload.jsp page originate from an authenticated user. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities via directory traversal specifiers sent in a specially crafted request to the FileDownload.jsp page. |
