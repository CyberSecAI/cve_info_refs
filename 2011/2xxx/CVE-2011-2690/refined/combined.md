How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| **libpng** |
| --- |

**libpng** is the official PNG reference library. It supports almost
all PNG features, is extensible, and has been extensively tested for
over 29 years. The home site for development versions (i.e., may be

buggy or subject to change or include experimental features) is [https://libpng.sourceforge.io/](https://libpng.sourceforge.io/index.html), and
the place to go for questions about the library is the [**png-mng-implement**](pngmisc.html#lists) mailing list.

libpng is available as ANSI C (C89) source code and requires **zlib 1.0.4**
or later (**1.2.13** or later recommended for performance and security
reasons). The current public release, **libpng 1.6.45**, includes minor
fixes and improvements:

* Hardened calculations in chroma handling to prevent overflows, and relaxed a constraint in cHRM validation to accomodate the standard ACES AP1 set of color primaries. (Contributed by John Bowler)* Removed the ASM implementation of ARM Neon optimizations and updated the build accordingly. Only the remaining C implementation shall be used from now on, thus ensuring the support of the PAC/BTI security features on ARM64. (Contributed by Ross Burton and John Bowler)* Fixed the pickup of the PNG\_HARDWARE\_OPTIMIZATIONS option in the CMake build on FreeBSD/amd64. This is an important performance fix on this platform.* Applied various fixes and improvements to the CMake build. (Contributed by Eric Riff, Benjamin Buch and Erik Scholz)* Added fuzzing targets for the simplified read API. (Contributed by Mikhail Khachayants)* Fixed a build error involving pngtest.c under a custom config. This was a regression introduced in a code cleanup in libpng-1.6.43. (Contributed by Ben Wagner)* Fixed and improved the config files for AppVeyor CI and Travis CI.

| | **Portability Note** The libpng  1.6.x  series continues the evolution of the libpng API, finally **hiding the contents** of the venerable and hoary **png\_struct** and **png\_info** data structures inside **private (i.e., non-installed) header files**. Instead of direct struct-access, applications should be using the various png\_get\_xxx() and png\_set\_xxx() accessor functions, which have existed for almost as long as libpng itself. libpng 1.8.x is now under development and will eliminate some long-deprecated APIs and "features," potentially breaking compatibility with very old apps. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The portability notice should not come as a particular surprise
to anyone who has added libpng support to an application this millenium; the
manual has warned of it since at least July 2000. (Specifically:
*"Starting with version 2.0.0, both structures are going to be hidden, and
the contents of the structures will only be accessible through the
png\_get/png\_set functions."* OK, so the version number was off a
bit...and the grammar, too, but who's counting?) Those whose apps depend on
the older API need not panic, however (for now); libpng 1.2.x continues to
get security fixes, as has 1.0.x for well over a decade. (Greg no longer
bothers to list either series here; enough's enough, folks. Update those
apps now!)

The 1.5.x and later series also include a new, more thorough test program
(pngvalid.c) and a new pnglibconf.h header file that
tracks what features were enabled or disabled when libpng was built. On
the other hand, they no longer internally include the zlib.h header
file, so applications that formerly depended on png.h to provide
that will now need to include it explicitly.
Complete differences relative to libpng 1.4.x
are detailed [here](src/libpng-1.4.x-to-1.5.x-summary.txt).

See the bottom of this page for warnings about

**security and crash bugs**
in versions up through **libpng 1.6.36**.

In addition to the main library sources,
all of the 1.2.x/1.4.x/1.5.x/1.6.x/1.7.x series include
the [rpng, rpng2 and wpng](book/sources.html) demo programs,
the pngminus demo program, a subset of Willem van Schaik's
[PngSuite test images](http://www.schaik.com/pngsuite/),
and Willem's VisualPng demo program.

### Security and Crash Bugs in Older Versions

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.36 and earlier have a use-after-free bug in the simplified libpng API png\_image\_free(). It has been assigned ID [CVE-2019-7317](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-7317). The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.37**, released on 15 April 2019. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng version 1.6.31 added png\_handle\_eXIf(), which has a null-pointer-dereference bug as well as a potential memory leak. Insofar as the function has existed for only four weeks and the chunk itself for only six, it's unlikely there are any applications affected by it at this time, but they might come into existence in the future. The vulnerability is fixed in version **1.6.32**, released on 24 August 2017. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.26, 1.5.27, 1.4.19, 1.2.56, and 1.0.66, respectively, have a null-pointer-dereference bug in png\_set\_text\_2() when an image-editing application adds, removes, and re-adds text chunks to a PNG image. (This bug does *not* affect pure viewers, nor are there any known editors that could trigger it without interactive user input. It has been assigned ID [CVE-2016-10087](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-10087).) The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.6.27**, **1.5.28**, **1.4.20**, **1.2.57**, and **1.0.67**, released on 29 December 2016. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all **old-branch** libpng versions through 1.5.25, 1.4.18, 1.2.55, and 1.0.65, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_check\_keyword(), which has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-8540](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8540)). The vulnerability is fixed in versions **1.5.26**, **1.4.19**, **1.2.56**, and **1.0.66**, released on 17 December 2015.  The current branch (1.6.x) is *not* vulnerable to this bug. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.19, 1.5.24, 1.4.17, 1.2.54, and 1.0.64, respectively, have a potential pointer overflow/underflow in png\_handle\_sPLT()/png\_handle\_pCAL() (and in png\_handle\_iTXt()/png\_handle\_zTXt() in the pre-1.6 branches), and all such versions likewise have a bug in their png\_set\_PLTE() implementations that left it open to the out-of-bounds write ([CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126)) that was supposed to have been fixed in the previous release. The bugs are fixed in versions **1.6.20**, **1.5.25**, **1.4.18**, **1.2.55**, and **1.0.65**, released on 3 December 2015. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.18, 1.5.23, 1.4.16, 1.2.53, and 1.0.63, respectively, have a potential out-of-bounds read in png\_set\_tIME()/png\_convert\_to\_rfc1123() and an out-of-bounds write in png\_get\_PLTE()/png\_set\_PLTE(). The former vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2015-7981](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-7981) and the latter [CVE-2015-8126](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-8126). The first is fixed in versions **1.6.19**, **1.5.24**, **1.4.17**, **1.2.54**, and **1.0.64**, released on 12 November 2015; see the subsequent vulnerability warning for info about the latter fix. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.9 through 1.6.15 (and some subset of versions up through 1.5.20) have an integer-overflow vulnerability in png\_combine\_row() when decoding very wide interlaced images, which can allow an attacker to overwrite an arbitrary amount of memory with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-9495](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-9495) and is fixed in versions **1.6.16** and **1.5.21**, released on 21 December 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Virtually all libpng versions through 1.6.14, 1.5.19, 1.4.13, 1.2.51, and 1.0.61, respectively, have an out-of-bounds memory access in png\_user\_version\_check(). It is unclear whether this could lead to an actual exploit. The bug is fixed in versions **1.6.15**, **1.5.20**, etc., released on 20 November 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.0 through 1.6.9 hang when reading images that have zero-length IDAT chunks with the progressive (streaming) reader; a malicious web site could use this bug to cause a (minor) denial of service. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2014-0333](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0333) and is fixed in version **1.6.10**, released 6 March 2014. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng versions 1.6.1 through 1.6.7 fail to reject colormapped images with empty palettes, leading to a null-pointer dereference (crash) in png\_do\_expand\_palette(). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2013-6954](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6954) and is fixed in version **1.6.8**, released 19 December 2013. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Various versions of libpng through 1.5.11, 1.4.11, 1.2.49, and 1.0.59, respectively, set the top-level archive-extraction directory's permissions to be world-writable as part of the distcheck Makefile target's operations (configure-generated Makefile only). This could allow a local attacker on the build host to silently replace the extracted libpng library with a malicious version, conceivably poisoning an official binary distribution of libpng (though the likelihood of this seems remote), but more generally allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the permissions of the user running make. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2012-3386](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-3386) and is fixed in version **1.5.12** (and versions **1.4.12**, **1.2.50**, and **1.0.60**, respectively, on the older branches), released 10 July 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All "modern" versions of libpng through 1.5.9, 1.4.10, 1.2.48, and 1.0.58, respectively, fail to correctly handle malloc() failure for text chunks (in png\_set\_text\_2()), which can lead to memory corruption and the possibility of execution of hostile code. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3048](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3048) and is fixed in version **1.5.10** (and versions **1.4.11**, **1.2.49**, and **1.0.59**, respectively, on the older branches), released 29 March 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.5.8, 1.4.8, 1.2.46, and 1.0.56, respectively, fail to correctly validate a heap allocation in png\_decompress\_chunk(), which can lead to a buffer-overrun and the possibility of execution of hostile code on 32-bit systems. This **serious vulnerability** has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3026](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3026) and is fixed in version **1.5.9** (and versions **1.4.9**, **1.2.47**, and **1.0.57**, respectively, on the older branches), released 18 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 through 1.5.7 contain a one-byte (stack) buffer-overrun bug in png\_formatted\_warning(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) or, conceivably, execution of hostile code. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3464](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3464) and is fixed in version **1.5.8**, released 1 February 2012. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.4 (only) introduced a divide-by-zero bug in png\_handle\_cHRM(), which could lead to crashes (denial of service) in applications that support color correction. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-3328](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-3328) ([CERT VU#477046](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/477046)) and is fixed in version **1.5.5**, released 22 September 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All released versions of libpng (from 1.0 onward) have a buffer overrun in the code that promotes palette images with transparency (1 channel) to grayscale+alpha images (2 channels), but only for applications that call png\_rgb\_to\_gray() and not png\_set\_expand(). (None are known.) An arbitrary amount of memory may be overwritten in this case, with arbitrary (attacker-controlled) data. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2690](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2690).  libpng 1.2.20 and later crashes in png\_default\_error() due to internal use of a NULL pointer instead of the empty string (""). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2691](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2691).  Many (most?) versions of libpng read uninitialized memory when handling empty sCAL chunks, and they handle malformed sCAL chunks (those lacking a delimiting NULL between the internal strings) incorrectly. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-2692](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2692).  All of these issues are fixed in version **1.5.4** (as well as **1.4.8**, **1.2.45**, and **1.0.55** on the older branches), released 7 July 2011. | | --- | |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** libpng 1.5.0 (only) introduced a bug in the RGB-to-grayscale transform code, which can lead to buffer overruns due to incorrect calculation of the number of bytes per pixel. (Since 1.5.0 was just released, no apps or OS distributions are believed to ship with it, so the risk should be minimal.) This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2011-0408](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0408) ([CERT VU#643140](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/643140)) and is fixed in version **1.5.1**, released 3 February 2011. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Several versions of libpng through 1.4.2 (and through 1.2.43 in the older series) contain a bug whereby progressive applications such as web browsers (or the rpng2 demo app included in libpng) could receive an extra row of image data beyond the height reported in the header, potentially leading to an out-of-bounds write to memory (depending on how the application is written) and the possibility of execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2010-1205](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1205) (via Mozilla). An additional memory-leak bug, involving images with malformed sCAL chunks, is also present; it could lead to an application crash (denial of service) when viewing such images. Both bugs are fixed in versions **1.4.3** and **1.2.44**, released 25 June 2010. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Jeff Phillips reported that several versions of libpng through 1.2.35 contain an uninitialized-memory-read bug that may have security implications. Specifically, 1-bit (2-color) interlaced images whose widths are not divisible by 8 may result in several uninitialized bits at the end of certain rows in certain interlace passes being returned to the user. An application that failed to mask these out-of-bounds pixels might display or process them, albeit presumably with benign results in most cases. This bug may be fixed in version **1.2.36**, released 7 May 2009, but the correct fix is in version **1.2.37**, released 4 June 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 0.89c through 1.2.34 contain an uninitialized-data bug that can be triggered by a malicious user. Specifically, there are several instances in which a malloc'd array of pointers is then initialized by a secondary sequence of malloc() calls. If one of these calls fails, libpng's cleanup routine will attempt to free the entire array, including any uninitialized pointers, which could lead to execution of an attacker's code with the privileges of the libpng user (including remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site). This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2009-0040](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0040) and is fixed in version **1.2.35**, released 18 February 2009. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.30 and 1.2.31 of libpng can crash when reading images with multiple zTXt chunks; it is likely that this vulnerability could lead to a remote compromise in the case of a libpng-based browser visiting a hostile web site. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-3964](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3964) and is fixed in version **1.2.32**, released 18 September 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** All versions of libpng from 1.0.6 through 1.2.26 have a bug when handling unknown (to libpng) chunks with zero data length. Applications that call either png\_set\_read\_user\_chunk\_fn() or png\_set\_keep\_unknown\_chunks(), when used with standard builds of libpng (i.e., built with either PNG\_READ\_UNKNOWN\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED or PNG\_READ\_USER\_CHUNKS\_SUPPORTED defined), can crash when attempting to free a non-existent data buffer for the unknown chunk. The **pngtest** sample application distributed with libpng, **pngcrush**, and certain versions of **ImageMagick** are known to be affected, but the bug is otherwise believed to be quite rare. This vulnerability has been assigned ID [CVE-2008-1382](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1382) and is fixed in version **1.2.27**, released 28 April 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Crash Warning** Most versions of libpng up through 1.2.24 have a number of minor coding errors that could lead to crashes in exceptional cases. For example, if memory allocation fails while processing certain ancillary chunks, libpng could crash while attempting to write to the NULL pointer; or if the application author failed to set up the info\_ptr as required, some parts of libpng fail to check for NULL and could crash trying to read the pointer (though it's probable that the error would have caused libpng to terminate upstream of these parts). The bugs are fixed in version **1.2.25**, released 18 February 2008. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Version 1.2.21 has a crash bug when reading the ICC-profile chunk, iCCP ([CVE-2007-5267](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5267)). This bug is fixed in version **1.2.22**, released 13 October 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.2.20 and earlier have a number of potential crash-bugs due to out-of-bounds reads in certain chunk-handlers; MITRE has collectively assigned them the identifiers [CVE-2007-5266](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5266), [CVE-2007-5268](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5268) and [CVE-2007-5269](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5269). These bugs are fixed in version **1.2.21**, released 4 October 2007, but another crash bug (related to the ICC-profile chunk) remains to be fixed in version **1.2.22**. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.16 (and 1.0.24) have an NULL-pointer-dereference vulnerability involving palette images with a malformed tRNS chunk (i.e., one with a bad CRC value). This bug can, at a minimum, cause crashes in browsers simply by visiting a page displaying such an image; reportedly it also crashes the Microsoft Windows display manager. CERT refers to it as [VU#684664](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/684664) and MITRE as [CVE-2007-2445](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2445). It's fixed in versions **libpng 1.2.18** and **libpng 1.0.26** (also **1.2.17** and **1.0.25**, which had a bug in their configure scripts), released 15 May 2007. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions 1.0.6 through 1.2.12 and 1.0.20 have a bug in the decoder for the sPLT ("suggested palette") chunk; this can lead to crashes and, accordingly, a denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). The bug is fixed in **libpng 1.2.13** and **libpng 1.0.21**, released 15 November 2006. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-5793](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5793). The same releases also include fixes for a specific class of application error (NULL png\_ptr) and for a bug in the code that *writes* the iCCP ("ICC profile") chunk. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

| | **Vulnerability Warning** Versions up through 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 have a buffer-overrun vulnerability when a particular error message is triggered. The overrun is always by exactly two bytes ('k' and NULL) so it seems highly unlikely that it could be used for anything more nefarious than denial of service (e.g., crashing your browser when you visit a site displaying a specially crafted PNG). Nevertheless, it's worth fixing, and versions **libpng 1.2.12** and **libpng 1.0.20**, released 27 June 2006, do just that. (Note that 1.2.11 and 1.0.19 erroneously claimed to include the fix, but in fact it had been inadvertently omitted.) MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-3334](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3334). The same releases (and their immediate predecessors) also fix an out-of-bounds (by one) memory read and a second buffer overrun, this one in the code that *writes* the sCAL ("physical scale of subject") chunk (which is rather rare in any case). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

There have been other issues in older versions released in 2004:

| | **Crash Warning** Versions 1.2.7, 1.2.6, 1.0.17, and 1.0.16 have a bug that will cause applications that strip the alpha channel (while reading a PNG) to crash. The bug is fixed in versions **1.2.8** and **1.0.18**, which were released on 3 December 2004. MITRE refers to this bug as [CVE-2006-0481](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0481). | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

The release before that fixed another bug, this one in the PNG-writing code:

| | **Broken-Image Warning** Versions 1.2.6 and 1.0.16 can write an invalid zlib header within the PNG datastream. This is not quite as bad as it sounds since the two-byte header can be corrected fairly easily (e.g., use [pngcrush](http://pmt.sf.net/pngcrush/) to rewrite the images and, perhaps, compress them slightly better, or run the *png-fix-IDAT-windowsize* utility bundled with [pngcheck](apps/pngcheck.html) 2.1.0 or later), but some applications will display the images incorrectly. Microsoft Word and Internet Explorer are known to be affected. A [libpng patch](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.2.6-patch-pngwutil.txt) is available, and versions **1.2.7** and **1.0.17** (incorporating the fix) were released on 11 September 2004. | | --- | |
| --- | --- |

Finally--and most important--there were several security vulnerabilities
present in versions of libpng prior to 1.2.6 and 1.0.16, one of which is
**quite dangerous**:

| | **Vulnerability Warning** On 4 August 2004 a new **jumbo security patch** was released to address several potential vulnerabilities in libpng, at least one of which is *quite serious*. It was followed on 15 August by the full **libpng 1.2.6** and **libpng 1.0.16** releases, which, like subsequent releases, incorporate the fix. All users are strongly urged to upgrade to the latest release of libpng or to patch any affected applications as soon as possible. *(Graphical browsers and e-mail clients are particularly at risk.)* Get the latest releases or an appropriate combo patch either from [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624) (headings [1.2.5-security-patches](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683&release_id=257244) and [1.2.5and-older-sec-patchs](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5624&package_id=5683&release_id=258110)) or from Oregon State's Open Source Lab. Here's the [CERT advisory](http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA04-217A.html), along with the relevant CERT and MITRE vulnerability pages:  * **CERT [VU#388984](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/388984)**   (CVE [CAN-2004-0597](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0597))   (this is the **serious** one!)* CERT [VU#160448](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/160448)     (CVE [CAN-2004-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0599))* CERT [VU#236656](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/236656)       (CVE [CAN-2004-0598](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0598))* CERT [VU#286464](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/286464)         (CVE [CAN-2004-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0599))* CERT [VU#477512](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/477512)           (CVE [CAN-2004-0599](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0599))* CERT [VU#817368](http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/817368)             (CVE [CAN-2004-0597](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0597))   These vulnerabilities were discovered by Chris Evans and are also described in [his alert](http://scary.beasts.org/security/CESA-2004-001.txt).

Debian Bug     : #632786 #633871

The PNG library libpng has been affected by several vulnerabilities. The
most critical one is the identified as CVE-2011-2690. Using this
vulnerability, an  attacker is able to overwrite memory with an
arbitrary amount of data controlled by her via a crafted PNG image.

The other vulnerabilities are less critical and allow an attacker to
cause a  crash in the program (denial of service) via a crafted PNG
image.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny5. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive processing scripts, the updated packages cannot be released
in paralell with the packages for Squeeze. They will appear shortly.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze1.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.46-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=720607#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-12 09:09:27 UTC  ``` libpng overwrites unallocated memory when promoting a paletted image with  transparency (one channel) to gray-alpha (two channels), only if the  application calls png_rgb_to_gray() but fails to call png_set_expand().  This bug exists in all released versions of libpng (1.0, 1.2, 1.4 and 1.5). The data overwritten is entirely controlled by the image data in the PNG file and it is possible to cause any string of data to be written by fabricating an appropriate PNG file.  The amount of overwrite is equal to the row length of the original image.   This has been fixed in libpng-1.5.4, libpng-1.4.8, libpng-1.2.45, and libpng-1.0.55.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=720607#c1)  Huzaifa S.

# libpng: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **201206-15**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libpng might allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-libs/libpng** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.5.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.5.10**>= **1.2.49** |

### Background

libpng is a standard library used to process PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) images. It is used by several programs, including web browsers
and potentially server processes.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng:

* The “embedded\_profile\_len()” function in pngwutil.c does not
  check for negative values, resulting in a memory leak (CVE-2009-5063).
* The “png\_format\_buffer()” function in pngerror.c contains an
  off-by-one error (CVE-2011-2501).
* The “png\_rgb\_to\_gray()” function in pngrtran.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2011-2690).
* The “png\_err()” function in pngerror.c contains a NULL pointer
  dereference error (CVE-2011-2691).
* The “png\_handle\_sCAL()” function in pngrutil.c improperly handles
  malformed sCAL chunks(CVE-2011-2692).
* The “png\_decompress\_chunk()” function in pngrutil.c contains an
  integer overflow error (CVE-2011-3026).
* The “png\_inflate()” function in pngrutil.c contains and out of
  bounds error (CVE-2011-3045).
* The “png\_set\_text\_2()” function in pngset.c contains an error
  which could result in memory corruption (CVE-2011-3048).
* The “png\_formatted\_warning()” function in pngerror.c contains an
  off-by-one error (CVE-2011-3464).

### Impact

An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary
code with the permissions of the user running the vulnerable program,
which could be the root user, or to cause programs linked against the
library to crash.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libpng 1.5 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.5.10"

```

All libpng 1.2 users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-libs/libpng-1.2.49"

```

Packages which depend on this library may need to be recompiled. Tools
such as revdep-rebuild may assist in identifying some of these packages.
