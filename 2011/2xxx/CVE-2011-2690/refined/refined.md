Here's the breakdown of the information related to CVE-2011-2690 from the provided documents:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **libpng buffer overwrite:** The core issue is a buffer overwrite vulnerability within the `png_rgb_to_gray()` function in libpng.
*   **Improper Promotion:** This occurs when a paletted image with transparency (1 channel) is promoted to a gray-alpha image (2 channels), but only when `png_rgb_to_gray()` is called without a prior call to `png_set_expand()`.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `png_rgb_to_gray` function.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The overflow leads to a buffer overwrite, allowing an attacker to write arbitrary data controlled via a crafted PNG image to unallocated memory.
*   **Unvalidated Heap Allocation:** In older versions there was an issue in `png_decompress_chunk` with a missing validation on a heap allocation that could lead to a buffer-overrun.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the vulnerable application.
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploitation can lead to crashes.
*   **Memory Corruption:**  The memory overwrite can lead to application instability, data corruption, or unexpected behavior.
*   **Data Leakage:** Uninitialized memory may be read.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious PNG Image:** The primary attack vector involves tricking a user or an automated system into opening or processing a specially crafted PNG image file.
*   **Web Browsers:** This could occur via a malicious website, email attachments, or other applications that process PNG images.
*   **Image Editors** Applications that use the vulnerable functions could lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted PNG Image:**  The attacker needs the ability to create a PNG image file designed to trigger the overflow vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker typically needs the targeted user to open or otherwise process the crafted PNG image using a vulnerable application. This might involve social engineering or exploiting website vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** In cases where web browsers or server processes are vulnerable, remote attackers may exploit the issue.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Software:** The vulnerability affects all versions of libpng from 1.0 onward through libpng 1.5.x
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was addressed in libpng versions 1.5.4, 1.4.8, 1.2.45, and 1.0.55, and later versions.
*   **Red Hat:** Red Hat addressed this vulnerability in RHSA-2011:1104 and RHSA-2011:1105.
*   **Ubuntu:** Ubuntu addressed this vulnerability in USN-1175-1
*   **Debian:** Debian released DSA-2287-1 to address the vulnerability.
*   **Gentoo:** Gentoo released GLSA 201206-15 to address the vulnerability.
*   **Apple:** Apple patched this vulnerability in OS X Lion v10.7.2 and Security Update 2011-006.
*   **libpng versions:** libpng versions 1.6.36 and earlier have a use-after-free bug and versions through 1.6.26, 1.5.27, 1.4.19, 1.2.56, and 1.0.66 have a null-pointer-dereference bug.
*   **libpng usage:** libpng is often used in web browsers and server processes which may make a successful exploit more critical.
