Subject: Old CVE ids, public, but still "RESERVED"
Date: Friday 24 January 2014
From: Raphael Geissert <geissert@...ian.org>
To: Vulnerability Information Managers <vim@...rition.org>

Hi,

Attached are a list of CVE ids which are still marked as RESERVED
(i.e. no description/links/etc have been set) yet our security tracker
knows about them. The tracker only containing public data, it means
that the ids are not embargoed.

Hopefully these lists can be useful to MITRE to catch up on those, or
to anyone else.
I can generate these and other reports regularly if desired.

Notes:
* The year in the file name corresponds to the year in the CVE id, not
necessarily the year of assignment.
* The lists only contain the CVE id, probably a short description, and
one line of data from our tracker. The full data can be obtained
either by going to
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-YYYY-XXXX> or by
looking up on our text database.

Cheers,
--

| Package | Type | Release | Fixed Version | Urgency | Origin | Debian Bugs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [xpdf](/tracker/source-package/xpdf) | source | squeeze | 3.02-12+squeeze1 |  |  |  |

## Notes

```
[lenny] - xpdf <no-dsa> (zxpdf script is indeed affected, but it's not associated with pdf handling by default, so not a concern for remote abuse)

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

Subject: xpdf: crafted .pdf.gz file name can delete any single-letter-named
file

[[Message part 1](bugreport.cgi?att=0;bug=635849;msg=5) (text/plain, inline)]
```
```
Package: xpdf
Version: 3.02-18
Severity: critical
Justification: causes serious data loss

Using a crafted .pdf.gz file name (which could be sent from a Web
server to a browser, for example), xpdf can be fooled into deleting an
unrelated file as long as its name is a single letter.

$ touch y                            # The unrelated victim file
$ gzip -c </dev/null >'" y ".pdf.gz' # Create a .pdf.gz file
$ xpdf '" y ".pdf.gz'                # View it using xpdf
Error: May not be a PDF file (continuing anyway)
Error: PDF file is damaged - attempting to reconstruct xref table...
Error: Couldn't find trailer dictionary
Error: Couldn't read xref table
rm: cannot remove `/tmp/': Is a directory
$ ls -l y                            # The victim file is gone!
ls: cannot access y: No such file or directory

Thanks,
	Ken

One can even execute commands up to 3 characters! e.g.

$ gzip -c </dev/null >'`env`.pdf.gz'
$ xpdf '`env`.pdf.gz'

thanks

Hi,

I think this is the risk of creating a feature without peer review.
Thank for doing it for us.  We now know that risks are real.

Uses of shell glob have this kind of problem unless proper option are
used.

Can any of you who seems to know bettwer on this subject propse good
solution while keeping major part of this feature.  Other wise we get
bug report for breaking backward comparibility without good reason.

If we do not get good patch, I think we should kill this feature.

Patch welcomed.

Regards,

Osamu

I think there is a very easy solution concerning this bug (there
may be other bugs, though): do not use the -p tempfile option.
AFAIK, this option is useless (it might be used to retrieve the
temporary file more easily, but this isn't important).

I think there could be problems with the -m option if filenames
contain a quote character. But I would say that the consequence
could be only "strange" error messages.

Yes, using the original file name to as part of the tempfile name is a
no no, and I really should know better (we all make mistakes...). Thanks
for noticing the core of the problem.  I'll fix it right away.

Best wishes,
Mike

Dear maintainer,

Recently you fixed one or more security problems and as a result you closed
this bug. These problems were not serious enough for a Debian Security
Advisory, so they are now on my radar for fixing in the following suites
through point releases:

lenny (5.0.9) 	- use target "oldstable"
squeeze (6.0.3)	- use target "stable"

Please prepare a minimal-changes upload targetting each of these suites,
and submit a debdiff to the Release Team [0] for consideration. They will
offer additional guidance or instruct you to upload your package.

I will happily assist you at any stage if the patch is straightforward and
you need help. Please keep me in CC at all times so I can
track the progress of this request.

For details of this process and the rationale, please see the original
announcement [1] and my blog post [2].

Hi Jonathan,

I'll get this done when I get a chance.  Once these are prepared will you be
willing to sponsor the upload?  I'm just a lowly DM right now.

Best wishes,
Mike

This is still vaguely vulnerable if a malicious or incompetent person
has control of TMPDIR (which I admit is far-fetched).  Wasn't the
original intent closer to

	trap "rm -f -- \"\$tmp\"" EXIT HUP INT QUIT TERM

which prevents the variable from being interpolated in advance at all?

```

The problem was never that an attacker had control of /tmp (it was
that an attacker had control of the pdf's file name). If the attacker
has control of /tmp and all can generate any file name permutation in
time to get his malicious version in place of the intended one, then
the real issue is that tmpfile's file name generation is weak, and the
problem would need to fixed there.

Best wishes,
Mike

Not really.  If I set the TMPDIR environment variable to something
containing shell metacharacters, then tempfile(1) [note, the utility,
not the library function] will use it.  And the underescaping is still
present.  This has nothing to do with symlink attacks.

Ok, I see now.  Then the root cause is that tempfile will "listen to"
the TMPDIR setting.  So, to fix that core problem, shouldn't we disable
it?  Note functionality shouldn't be lost since there is still the
"--directory" option; although some scripts may need to be fixed.

But in the meantime I'll add the additional hardening.

Best wishes,
Mike

The underescaping is the original (and only) bug.  In my original
message, I mentioned a malicious or incompetent user having control of
the TMPDIR envvar; I actually think incompetent is more likely than
malicious and that neither is too likely.

I'm not suggesting an extra security advisory or anything.  My actual
concern was and is that people reading and writing scripts use good
habits (rather than using fragile workarounds that leave the script's
behavior hard to understand).  I don't think that's academic.

OK, your messages in #635849 seemed to indicate a real security flaw
remained (i.e. the "vaguely vulnerable" statement).  Since that isn't
really the case, I'm closing the new bug in debianutils I just opened.
I will still clean up the escaping in the xpdf script, but I'm not
treating that with any urgency.

Best wishes,
Mike

No, we should not assume that TMPDIR is set by a malicious agent; that
is possible but it is also possible that TMPDIR is set by a friendly
agent whose goal is to increase the security of the system by putting
temporary files in a secure place inacessible to other, malicious users.

The correct thing to do is to respect the setting of TMPDIR precisely.
If the value of TMPDIR contains any special characters, xpdf should put
any temporary files in that directory, whose name contains the same
special characters.  That is what is achieved by Jonathan Nieder's fix

The fix is fine; however $TMPDIR should not contain spaces and other
special characters because various tools don't support them (starting
with the autotools). Of course, it's better to have a program that
works correctly even in the case where $TMPDIR has special characters.

OK, nevertheless if an attacker has control of TMPDIR, you have much
worse problems, so this is not security-relevant. I agree to fix this
based on the fact that it is indeed more correct, but I'm not treating
it with any urgency.  If you want to make sure I remember to fix it,
please open a new bug.

Thanks,
Mike
