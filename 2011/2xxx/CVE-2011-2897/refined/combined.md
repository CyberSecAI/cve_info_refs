### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-24 15:14:11 UTC  ``` Input validation flaw was discovered in the SDL_image image handling library.  Value read from the Gif file is not properly validated against the buffer size and can cause a buffer overflow.  More details about this issue can be found here:  <http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=120110205511630&w=4>  Advisory states new upstream version 1.2.7 should be released soon addressing this flaw.  Relevant upstream SVN commit seems to be: <http://www.libsdl.org/cgi/viewvc.cgi/trunk/SDL_image/IMG_gif.c?r1=3462&r2=3461&pathrev=3462>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-24 15:23:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 292800](attachment.cgi?id=292800 "Reproducer from the advisory") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=292800&action=edit "Reproducer from the advisory") Reproducer from the advisory   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-24 17:40:07 UTC  ``` This seems to be the same issue as [CVE-2006-4484](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4484) (reported for gd embedded in php sources back in 2006):  Buffer overflow in the LWZReadByte_ function in ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c in the GD extension in PHP before 5.1.5 allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a GIF file with input_code_size greater than MAX_LWZ_BITS, which triggers an overflow when initializing the table array.  GD/PHP CVS commit: <http://cvs.php.net/viewcvs.cgi/gd/libgd/src/gd_gif_in.c?r1=1.3&r2=1.4>  Seems to be included in upstream gd as of version 2.0.34.    ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c4)  Brian Pepple    2008-01-24 23:20:55 UTC  ``` Hey Tomas, should this bug still be filed against SDL_image, or should I open a new bug against it?   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2008-01-25 13:23:46 UTC  ``` Brian, our process is to file security bugs against 'Security Response' product and make "tracking bugs" for affected product versions (current versions of Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat layered products).  Technically, you do not need Fedora bugs against SDL_image component in any specific Fedora version, but we usually create them to make tracking of the issue easier.    ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c8)  Fedora Update System    2008-01-29 20:26:54 UTC  ``` SDL_image-1.2.5-7.fc7 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 7   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c9)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-01 15:58:13 UTC  ``` There are other apps / projects affected by this problem too, as this GIF handling code that seem to have been originally written by David Koblas is used in more or less modified form in many projects:  Already listed above:  SDL_image - to be fixed in 1.2.7 gd - fixed in 2.0.34  Other identified affected projects:  netpbm (giftopnm converter) - fixed in 10.27 tk - to be fixed in upcoming 8.5.1  Other affected projects identified by Raphaël Marichez of Gentoo:  sourcenav (<http://sourcenav.sourceforge.net>) (verified in v 5.1.4) insight (<http://sourceware.org/insight/>) (verified in v 6.5) TK Perl Module (<http://search.cpan.org/~ni-s/>) (verified in v 804.027)  perl-Tk is also shipped in Fedora.    ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c10)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-02 01:20:20 UTC  ``` SDL_image-1.2.5-7.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c11)  Fedora Update System    2008-02-02 08:59:21 UTC  ``` SDL_image-1.2.5-7.fc7 has been pushed to the Fedora 7 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c12)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-02 17:32:10 UTC  ``` Mitre has assigned CVE id [CVE-2007-6697](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6697) to this issue as affecting SDL_image.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c13)  Tomas Hoger    2008-02-05 08:59:09 UTC  ``` Public now for other affected projects.  Opening [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c9).  <http://tktoolkit.cvs.sourceforge.net/tktoolkit/tk/generic/tkImgGIF.c?r1=1.40&r2=1.41> <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=464056>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=430100#c14)  Red Hat Product Security    2008-04-24 11:15:16 UTC  ``` This issue was addressed in:  Fedora:   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F7/FEDORA-2008-1231>   <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/F8/FEDORA-2008-1208>     ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727081#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-01 09:48:32 UTC  ``` GDK's GIF image reader is based on David Koblas' code that is also used in several other GIF image readers.  This code contained an input validation flaw.  Input code size was read from input GIF file and used to initialize decoding tables without checking the value, leading to buffer overflow.  Relevant GDK code is:    941 static int   942 gif_prepare_lzw (GifContext *context)   943 {     ...   946   if (!gif_read (context, &(context->lzw_set_code_size), 1)) {   947       /*g_message (_("GIF: EOF / read error on image data\n"));*/   948       return -1;   949   }     ...   952   context->lzw_clear_code = 1 << context->lzw_set_code_size;     ...   962   for (i = 0; i < context->lzw_clear_code; ++i) {   963       context->lzw_table[0][i] = 0;   964       context->lzw_table[1][i] = i;   965   }  The same flaw was previously reported for several other components that include GIF reading code based on David Koblas' parser, such as: gd ([CVE-2006-4484](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2006-4484)), SDL_image ([CVE-2007-6697](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2007-6697)), tk ([CVE-2008-0553](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-0553)), netbpm ([CVE-2008-0554](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-0554)), cups ([CVE-2008-1373](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2008-1373)).  This problem was corrected upstream long ago:  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/gdk-pixbuf/io-gif.c?id=3bac204e0d0241a0d68586ece7099e6acf0e9bea>  The fix can be found in all gdk-pixbuf versions embedded in gtk2 packages, but it seems it never got it to stand-alone gdk-pixbuf version for gtk+ 1.x.  Gimp corrected this bug ~2 years after GDK:  <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gimp/commit/plug-ins/common/gifload.c?id=cac290d093d0c318bbe33a4ff290c2abbd9698d3>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727081#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-01 09:55:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516104](attachment.cgi?id=516104 "Load image using gdk-pixbuf") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516104&action=edit "Load image using gdk-pixbuf") Load image using gdk-pixbuf  This only calls gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() to have specified image file parsed by gdk-pixbuf.  Crash can be reproduced using the reproducer for SDL_image, see:  <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-6697#c1>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727081#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-04 08:30:13 UTC  ``` [CVE-2011-2897](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2897) was assigned here:   <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/5646>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=727081#c3)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-17 10:18:26 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=727081#c0)) > This problem was corrected upstream long ago: >  > <http://git.gnome.org/browse/gdk-pixbuf/commit/gdk-pixbuf/io-gif.c?id=3bac204e0d0241a0d68586ece7099e6acf0e9bea>  Relevant part is addition of this check to gif_prepare_lzw():  + if (context->lzw_set_code_size > MAX_LZW_BITS) {  It may need some different way to report error in older gdk-pixbuf version.   This issue affects gdk-pixbuf packages shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  The code is not used by other packages in the distribution.  The data written past the end of the buffer is not attacker controlled, which makes it more difficult to exploit for anything bug crash.  Hence we do not plan to address this problem immediately.  It may be fixed in the future gdk-pixbuf package updates.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727081#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-17 10:19:30 UTC  ``` Created gdk-pixbuf tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 731308](show_bug.cgi?id=731308 "CLOSED CANTFIX - CVE-2011-2897 gdk-pixbuf: GIF loader buffer overflow when initializing decompression tables [fedora-all]")]   ``` |  |
