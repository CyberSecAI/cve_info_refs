        "root_cause": "The Microsoft Windows kernel includes a driver (win32k.sys) that handles a variety of graphics processing tasks, including the processing of TrueType fonts. A vulnerability exists in the way this driver validates array indexes.",

        "weaknesses": "Insufficient validation of array indexes within the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) when processing TrueType font files.",

        "attack_vectors": "An attacker could host a specially crafted TrueType font on a network share and when the user navigates to the share in Windows Explorer, the affected control path is triggered via the Details and Preview panes. Additionally, the user could open a malicious TrueType font file as an email attachment or navigate to a WebDAV share.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to persuade a user to either visit an untrusted network location or open the malicious font file. An attacker would have no way to force users to perform these actions.",
         "additional_details": "The file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on the perimeter firewall. This limits the potential remote attack vectors for this vulnerability."
