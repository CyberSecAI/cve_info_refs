Debian Security Advisory DSA-2335-1                   security@debian.org
<http://www.debian.org/security/>                                Nico Golde
November 5th, 2011                     <http://www.debian.org/security/faq>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : man2hhtml
Vulnerability  : missing input sanitization
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: yes
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2770

Tim Starling discovered that the Debian-native CGI wrapper for man2html,
a program to convert UNIX man pages to HTML, is not properly escaping
user-supplied input when displaying various error messages.  A remote
attacker can exploit this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6f-3+lenny1.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6f+repack-1+squeeze1.

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6g-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6g-6.

We recommend that you upgrade your man2html packages.
