Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2770:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the Debian-native CGI wrapper for `man2html`. Specifically, user-supplied input is not adequately escaped when generating error messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error messages, which are then rendered in a user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (indirect):** While not directly stated, XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute malicious javascript in the context of the victim's browser. This opens the door to a range of malicious activities, including session hijacking, cookie theft, and phishing attacks, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious input. 
- **CGI wrapper:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious input through the web interface that uses the vulnerable man2html CGI wrapper.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the vulnerable `man2html` CGI wrapper, typically through a web browser.
- No special access or privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional notes:**
- The advisory mentions that the issue is Debian-specific, which likely means the vulnerability exists in a Debian-modified version of the `man2html` software.
- The provided content contains specific version information for each affected Debian release (lenny, squeeze, wheezy, and sid) where the fix is available, allowing users to easily identify which version to upgrade to.
