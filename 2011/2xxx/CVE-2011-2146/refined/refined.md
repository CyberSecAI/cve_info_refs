Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2011-2146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `mount.vmhgfs` component of the VMware Host Guest File System (HGFS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The `mount.vmhgfs` component has a vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the Guest OS to determine if a path exists on the Host filesystem and whether that path is a file or a directory, regardless of the file system permissions of the host.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could gain information about the host's filesystem structure. This knowledge could be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves an attacker gaining access to a guest operating system running within a VMware environment that is using the shared folder feature (`mount.vmhgfs`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the guest operating system. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising an application within the guest.
    *   Having legitimate access to the guest (for example, a malicious insider).

**Affected Products/Versions:**

*   VMware Workstation 7.1.3 and earlier (Linux and Windows guests)
*   VMware Player 3.1.3 and earlier (Linux and Windows guests)
*   VMware Fusion 3.1.2 and earlier (OSX guests)
*   ESXi 4.1 without patch ESXi410-201104402-BG
*   ESXi 4.0 without patch ESXi400-201104402-BG
