Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2982:

**Summary:** CVE-2011-2982 is a memory corruption vulnerability found in Mozilla products, specifically Firefox, Thunderbird, and SeaMonkey. It stems from issues with how strings are handled, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue lies within the `JSString::chars()` method and similar functions that provide access to the underlying character array of a JavaScript string. The code does not always clear an `EXTENSIBLE` flag associated with string objects. This flag indicates whether the string's character buffer can be modified. Failure to clear this flag, especially when JavaScript code might be executed before the character array is accessed, can lead to hazards. This occurs on branches where the string's char array pointer can be mutated during concatenation, which is not the case on the trunk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** If JavaScript code execution modifies a string object, particularly when a getter is called that turns a string into a dependent string, the previously obtained character array pointer could become invalid, pointing to freed memory. When the program subsequently attempts to access the string's content (e.g., copying it), it leads to memory corruption.
*   **Dangling Pointers**: The EXTENSIBLE flag not being cleared, can lead to code using dangling pointers which were obtained before a potential string modification.
*   **GC Hazards:** The potential for a garbage collection (GC) cycle to occur before a string pointer is used can lead to a situation where the pointer references freed memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary concern is that a successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **Crash:** Memory corruption due to invalid pointer access leads to crashes of the affected applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when:

1.  A JavaScript string's character array is accessed via `JSString::chars()`.
2.  A potentially unsafe action occurs, such as calling a getter that might cause the string to become a dependent string.
3.  The program attempts to use the character array, which might now be invalid.

The attacker can exploit this through crafted JavaScript code that manipulates string objects. For example, using array-like objects and methods that can trigger getters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to:

*   Execute JavaScript code within the context of the affected application (e.g., by having the user load a malicious web page, open a crafted email, or use a malicious extension).
*   Understand how to construct JavaScript code that can cause a string object to transition into a state where its character pointer is no longer valid.
*   No specific position or privilege is required beyond being able to execute JS in the context of the application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in older versions of Firefox (3.6 branch) but not in later versions where string concatenation was modified to prevent the mutation of character arrays.
*   A patch was created to address the issue by ensuring the `JSString::chars()` and similar functions move string pointer access after calls that could cause JS code execution.

**Patch Information:**

The fix involves modifying the code to:

1.  Move the call to `JSString::chars()` after code that could execute JavaScript (e.g., calls to getters or setters) that could change the pointer.
2.  Or if this can not be done, call `JSString::chars()` multiple times to get the pointer after potentially modifying calls.

**Affected products and versions:**

*   Firefox 3.6.x
*   Thunderbird 3.x
*   SeaMonkey 2.x
*   XULRunner 1.9.2.x
*   Debian: Iceweasel, Iceape, Icedove
*   OpenSuse: MozillaFirefox,MozillaThunderbird,seamonkey

The vulnerability was resolved in:

* Firefox 3.6.20
* Iceweasel 3.5.16-9 (squeeze)
* Iceape 2.0.11-7 (squeeze)
* Icedove 3.0.11-1+squeeze4
