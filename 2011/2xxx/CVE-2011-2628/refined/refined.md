  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of nested frameset and iframe tags within the Opera browser.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to invalid memory addresses caused by the improper nesting of frameset and iframe tags."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution (RCE) or a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by visiting a specially crafted web page that exploits the browser's handling of nested frameset and iframe tags. This can be done remotely by an attacker hosting the malicious page.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to host a malicious web page. No authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to deliver this crafted page to the victim, likely through a link or advertisement."
