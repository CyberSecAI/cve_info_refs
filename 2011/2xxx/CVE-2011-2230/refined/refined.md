Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the Core RDBMS component of Oracle Database.
- It is related to how the system handles network connections via the Oracle NET protocol.
- The specific flaw is not detailed, but it allows for a partial denial of service by an unauthenticated remote attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The primary weakness is a lack of proper validation or handling of network requests, which leads to a partial denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a partial denial of service (DoS). 
- The system becomes partially unavailable, hindering normal operations.
- The impact is limited to a partial denial of service, meaning some functionality might still be accessible but degraded.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
- The attack is carried out via the Oracle NET protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability; no username/password is required.
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system to send malicious packets via the Oracle NET protocol.

**Affected Systems:**
- Oracle Database versions: 10.1.0.5, 10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 10.2.0.5, 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.1

**Additional Notes:**

- The Oracle document lists the vulnerability's impact as a "Partial+" Availability impact, which is reflected in the above summary as a partial denial of service.
- The provided text is consistent with the description of a low-complexity remote denial of service vulnerability as a CVSS base score of 5.0.
