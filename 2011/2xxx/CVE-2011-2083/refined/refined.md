The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in RT (Request Tracker), and specifically mentions CVE-2011-2083.

Based on the provided information:

**CVE-2011-2083:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The root cause is the presence of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the RT codebase.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in RT versions 3.0 and above.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could exploit these XSS vulnerabilities to run JavaScript code with the user's credentials within the context of the RT application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through malicious JavaScript injection, which could be done through various user-supplied inputs or crafted URLs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject malicious JavaScript into the RT application. This could be done by exploiting input fields, manipulating URLs, or other methods that allow for script insertion. The attacker could use a malicious link that the user clicks on, injecting through a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability where the malicious payload is stored on the server, or through another method where the application reflects user-supplied input back into the page without sanitization.
