{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the QCP media file parsing logic within the `qcpfformat.dll` library of RealNetworks RealPlayer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The software allocates a static 256-byte buffer on the heap.",
      "The software uses a user-supplied counter from the QCP file to control a memory copy loop.",
      "The source data for the memory copy is also user-supplied from the file."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code within the context of the web browser.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious web page that triggers the vulnerability via a crafted QCP file.",
      "Opening a malicious QCP file directly."
     ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious QCP file that includes an overly large user-supplied counter and source data to cause a heap buffer overflow. The attacker must then induce a user to either open the crafted QCP file or visit a website hosting the malicious file.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the way RealPlayer parses QCP media files.  Specifically, the `qcpfformat.dll` library allocates a static 256-byte buffer on the heap. When parsing a QCP file, a user-supplied counter is read from the file and is used in a loop to copy data from another user-supplied section of the QCP file into the buffer. By providing a large counter value and crafting the data in the source to be larger than the allocated buffer, an attacker can cause a heap-based buffer overflow."
