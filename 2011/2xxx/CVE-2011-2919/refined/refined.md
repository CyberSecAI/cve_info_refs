Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-2919

**Vulnerability Description:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Red Hat Network Satellite Server and Spacewalk.

**Root Cause:** The application for listing system groups did not properly HTML escape the content of the QueryString.

**Weakness:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation ('Cross-site Scripting').

**Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL containing JavaScript code in the QueryString parameters. When a user accesses the crafted URL, the malicious code is executed within the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Session Cookie Theft:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal the user's session cookie, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the application.
* **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to various malicious activities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a user of the vulnerable application (RHN Satellite Server and Spacewalk).
* **User Interaction:** The user needs to click on the attacker-crafted link.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability exists in the `SystemGroupList.do` page of the mentioned products. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed via the URL query string before rendering it on the page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Affected Products/Versions:**
* Red Hat Network Satellite Server
* Spacewalk

**Fix Information:**
* The issue was addressed in Red Hat Network Satellite Server v 5.4 via RHSA-2011:1299.
* Fixed in Spacewalk master, commit 2d9c34e7b682b375ea32595f0dd38b61f424a24f, tagged as spacewalk-java-1.6.46-1.
