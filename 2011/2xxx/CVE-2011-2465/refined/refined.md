Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2011-2465:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A defect in ISC BIND 9 when configured with certain Response Policy Zone (RPZ) configurations. Specifically, the presence of certain CNAME records or any DNAME records in an RPZ zone when recursion is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how BIND 9 handles specific types of records (CNAME and DNAME) within RPZ zones.
*   The issue is triggered when the server attempts to process these records, leading to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can cause the `named` daemon to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This makes the DNS server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote. An attacker sends specially crafted queries to the BIND server.
*   The attacker does not need authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to a vulnerable BIND server.
*   The vulnerable server must be configured with an RPZ zone containing certain CNAME or any DNAME records.
*   The BIND server must also have recursion enabled.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability is present in BIND versions 9.8.0 and later, but was fixed in version 9.8.0-P4
* The issue was present in several Linux distributions including openSUSE 11.3 and 11.4, Fedora 15 and Fedora Rawhide.
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 were not affected as they did not include support for Response Policy Zones (RPZ).
