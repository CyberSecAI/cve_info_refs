{
  "CVE-2011-2987": {
    "root_cause": "The ANGLE library, used by Mozilla's WebGL implementation, had a heap overflow vulnerability due to an unchecked return code from the `GrowAtomTable()` function when memory allocation failed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow",
      "Missing check on memory allocation failure"
    ],
    "impact": "A potentially exploitable heap overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Triggering a memory allocation failure while processing WebGL content"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to craft a malicious shader program that would cause `GrowAtomTable()` to fail, leading to the heap overflow.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was reported by Michael Jordon of Context IS. A patch was created by Benoit Jacob that fixed an incorrect assignment that exacerbated the allocation problem (`atable->arev = newrev` instead of `atable->amap = newrev`). The issue was ultimately a problem in the ANGLE library, and a fix was committed upstream. The fix was later included in Mozilla products."
