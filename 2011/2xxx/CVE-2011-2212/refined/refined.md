  "CVE-2011-2212": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the virtio subsystem of QEMU-KVM.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of virtqueue in and out requests from the guest.",
      "Insufficient bounds checking on indirect descriptor buffer sizes"
    ],
    "impact": "A privileged guest user can trigger a buffer overflow, leading to a denial of service (guest crash) or, potentially, privilege escalation on the host.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation through malformed virtio requests.",
      "Sending a too-large indirect descriptor buffer"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "A privileged user within a QEMU guest can exploit this vulnerability."
