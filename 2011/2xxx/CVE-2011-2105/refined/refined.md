The root cause of one vulnerability is identified as improper handling of font data in Adobe Reader and Acrobat leading to memory corruption. These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, write arbitrary files, escalate privileges, or cause a denial of service by enticing users into opening specially crafted files like PDF, Shockwave or Flash content. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a crafted file or a link to a web page hosting malicious content. "
