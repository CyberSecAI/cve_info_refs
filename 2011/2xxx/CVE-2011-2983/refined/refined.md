  "vulnerabilityDetails": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of RegExp.input where data from other domains could be read when it was set. When RegExp.input is set, JSSubString which RegExp.$1 uses becomes a dangling pointer leading to access of freed-and-recycled memory.",
