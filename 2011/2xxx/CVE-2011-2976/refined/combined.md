Bugzilla 3.4.11 and below are affected by an XSS that is only possible if the user's BUGLIST cookie is somehow compromised. The bug\_list.first and bug\_list.last variables in the bug/navigate.html.tmpl template are not properly escaped when displayed.
As far as we know, it is not possible to compromise the BUGLIST cookie in Bugzilla, and as such we are not treating this as a high-priority security issue, but still something that we should fix for the 3.4 branch in case administrators have customized their installation in such a way that BUGLIST could have been compromised, or there are other programs on the user's system that could somehow have compromised the cookie.

Unfortunately this is not true. One of the peculiarities with cookie handling in all browsers is that anyone can set a cookie for any user on any site provided they are able to intercept some traffic from the victim to any other HTTP site.
I wrote a post and diagram on this issue which further describes the issue:
<http://michael-coates.blogspot.com/2010/01/cookie-forcing-trust-your-cookies-no.html>
The only solution to this issue is to enable HSTS. HSTS will prevent the victim's browser from being forced by the MITM to issue a HTTP request to the site in question.

But being able to set cookies is a significantly worse vulnerability than this, no? That is, if you can MITM somebody, you've already entirely encompassed this vulnerability and then some.

So the difference here is that the attacker is not actually MITM the SSL connection, that connection is totally valid and untouched. Instead the attacker MITMs other HTTP request made by the victim to different sites (e.g. maybe they are also browsing google or there browsing is sending requests for HTTP updates of some sort).
That's what makes this issue so frustrating, the attacker can intercept and modify a HTTP request by the victim to foo.com and use this to ultimately cause a new cookie to be set for the user's interaction with the bugzilla site.

Yes, but what could you do with an XSS that you couldn't already completely do with that MITM? If you can MITM somebody you own them, period, unless there's SSL, right?

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)

# BMO

From MozillaWiki

[Jump to navigation](#mw-head)
[Jump to search](#searchInput)

This is the main public page for all things related to <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org>, aka BMO, Mozilla's customized version of [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org).

BMO is a core piece of infrastructure at Mozilla. It is used to track not only bugs and feature requests but also many other tasks across various teams.

The BMO source is a slightly modified fork of Bugzilla with many custom extensions. It is currently based on Bugzilla 4.2 but with many features backported from 4.4 and master. All the BMO devs are also involved in the Bugzilla project, and we contribute features and fixes upstream where they are generally applicable, that is, not too specific to Mozilla's particular needs.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

# B-Team

The team that works on BMO is called the B-Team, because of past affiliation with the defunct Automation and Tools team (A-Team).

* dkl: Dave Lawrence (Owner/Engineer)
* glob (Manager)

The Low-level, security, and quality tools team contributes tooling, and development:

* calixte: Calixte Denizet, (AutoNag)
* marco: Marco Castelluccio, (BugBug)

We also also have some volunteers, that we consider to be part of the B-Team as well:

* seban: Sebastin Santy (long-term volunteer, past GSoC student)
* atoll: Richard Solderberg (Reviewer-at-Large, slightly borrowed from Mozilla IT)
* kohei: Kohei Yoshino, (UX Designer)
* *... and you can be one too!*

There are also some people that still have some involvement with BMO,
but their day-to-day attention is directed to other parts of Mozilla.

* zeid: Zeid Zabaneh (Engineer)

Past contributors include:

* mary: Mary Umoh (Intern, Summer 2017)
* gerv: Gervase Markham
* mcote: Mark Côté
* dylan: Dylan Hardison
* imadueme: Israel Madueme (Engineer)
* justdave: Dave Miller
* emceeaich: Emma Humphries, (Bugmaster)
* mhentges: Mitchell Hentges (Engineer)

# New Users

Getting used to Bugzilla can be a bit daunting. We have a short [introductory video](https://gerv.makes.org/popcorn/1bn6) available that is as gentle as possible. You may also be interested in the [[MDN section about Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Bugzilla)], which contains information more suitable as an introduction to a general audience. Of special interest is the MDN article, [What to do and what not to do in Bugzilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/What_to_do_and_what_not_to_do_in_Bugzilla), which contains instructions on getting elevated privileges.

# New Bots

If you have a bot that uses BMO, be sure to add it to the [BMO/Bot Registry](/BMO/Bot_Registry "BMO/Bot Registry")
so we know who to contact about it!

# User Guide

We're putting together a [user guide](/BMO/UserGuide "BMO/UserGuide") with helpful information on various aspects of Bugzilla. New and experienced users alike should benefit from it. There's a lot to go through, so please feel free to contribute!

# Road Map

We keep a yearly [road map](/BMO/Road_Map "BMO/Road Map") with our medium-term plans (1-2 years), at a high level. Also see our [current projects](/BMO#Current_Projects "BMO") for some of the big items we are working on in the current quarter.

# Browser Support For BMO

Full Support includes: The current versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, and Edge; and the latest Firefox ESR.

Limited Support includes: The previous versions of Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Safari, WebKit, Edge, and Firefox ESR; and Firefox Nightly.

Internet Explorer is no longer supported, though some features may still work with IE 11.

See [bug 1359310](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1359310) and [bug 1422435](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1422435).

## JavaScript and Analytics

JavaScript is required to use bugzilla.mozilla.org.

The `Do Not Track` header sent by your browser is honored.

# Third-Party Applications

Lots and lots of web apps and general tools have been written to interface with BMO. We have started [cataloguing them](/BMO/ThirdPartyApps "BMO/ThirdPartyApps"). If you're looking for different ways to interface with BMO, check it out; similarly, if you are thinking about writing an app, check the catalogue to see if something similar exists that you could use, contribute to, or fork before setting out on your own.

There's one in particular that is particularly important: [Phabricator](https://moz-conduit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/phabricator-user.html), Mozilla's new and growing code-review tool.

# More Information about BMO

Our discussion forum is mozilla.tools.bmo [[mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools-bmo)] [[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mozilla.tools.bmo)] [USENET].

We also have answers to [Frequently Asked Questions](/BMO/FAQ "BMO/FAQ") and a slightly-but-not-too-out-of-date [hardware diagram](http://people.mozilla.org/~justdave/BugzillaPhysicalDiagram-rev110504.png).

If you're building an application or tool that interfaces with BMO, you may be interested in the following:

* [Best practices and etiquette](/BMO/Integration_Best_Practice "BMO/Integration Best Practice") for integrating external apps with BMO
* Info and plans on Bugzilla's [REST API](/Bugzilla%3AREST_API "Bugzilla:REST API"), and the older, deprecated [BzAPI](/Bugzilla%3ABzAPI "Bugzilla:BzAPI").

Looking for another way to access Bugzilla's raw data? Try the [ElasticSearch cluster](/BMO/ElasticSearch "BMO/ElasticSearch").

# Contributing to BMO

If you'd like to help out with BMO specifically (as opposed to the general upstream [Bugzilla project](/Bugzilla "Bugzilla")), you can find us in #bmo on irc.mozilla.org. If you plan on contributing patches, see the documentation in the [README.rst](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/bmo/blob/master/README.rst). You can file bugs under the [bugzilla.mozilla.org product](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org). Don't file them under the Bugzilla product unless you are sure it's a bug in the general Bugzilla product. In particular, all administrative changes should be filed under bugzilla.mozilla.org (see below for more).

# Policies and Procedures

## Code Updates

Code updates are normally deployed to bugzilla.mozilla.org late Monday/early Tuesday, US/Pacific time, at no specific time, if changes need to be pushed out. Security fixes or other fatal type errors will always go out as soon as possible.

Updates are usually deployed on a weekly basis and are listed on the [BMO/Recent Changes](/BMO/Recent_Changes "BMO/Recent Changes") page.

## Administrative Changes

If you need changes to BMO's configuration to support your team, project, etc., please consult this page before filing bugs:

* [General information on requesting Changes to BMO](/BMO/Requesting_Changes "BMO/Requesting Changes")

## BMO Administrative Processes

* [Adding a new product](/BMO/new-product "BMO/new-product")
* [Adding a new "rapid release" version](/BMO/new-version "BMO/new-version")
* [Adding a new BMO security group](/BMO/new-security-group "BMO/new-security-group")
* [Retiring Products and Components](/BMO/RetiringComponents "BMO/RetiringComponents"): moving things to the Graveyard classification.
* [Restoring Disabled Accounts](/BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts "BMO/RestoringDisabledAccounts")
* [Merging Accounts](/index.php?title=BMO/MergingAccounts&action=edit&redlink=1 "BMO/MergingAccounts (page does not exist)")
* [Disabling Accounts](/BMO/DisablingAccounts "BMO/DisablingAccounts")

See also [BMO on Mana](https://mana.mozilla.org/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45845955) (requires LDAP).

## BMO Development and Other Processes

* [Overall Development Processes](/BMO/Development_Processes "BMO/Development Processes")

* [Planning a BMO outage](/BMO/OutagePlanning "BMO/OutagePlanning")
* [Reset the development branch to master](/BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch "BMO/ResetDevelopmentBranch")
* [Maintaining Perl Dependencies for BMO](/BMO/Perl_Dependencies "BMO/Perl Dependencies")

## Custom Bug Entry Forms

In the past, BMO developers supported writing custom bug entry forms specific for the needs of different projects and groups within Mozilla. In order to focus more on other important features, we will no longer be providing that support going forward. For more information on why this change was made, see [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.tools.bmo/tp4dSwUfKSA).

There is a new [custom form framework](https://github.com/mozilla-bteam/custom-form-example) being developed by an outside contributor named Sebastin Santy. It is still in the early stages but it eventually will be very useful for users who want to create a customized bug entry form that can be used to submit bugs to BMO.

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.
