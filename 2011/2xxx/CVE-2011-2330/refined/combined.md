## IBM Tivoli Endpoint lcfd.exe opts Argument Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-11-169ZDI-CAN-964

| CVE ID | [CVE-2011-1220](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2011-1220) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 10.0, [AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2.0&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/) |

| TREND MICRO CUSTOMER PROTECTION | Trend Micro TippingPoint IPS customers are protected against this vulnerability by Digital Vaccine protection filter ID ['11237']. For further product information on the TippingPoint IPS: <http://www.tippingpoint.com> |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of IBM Tivoli Endpoint. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, however it is trivially achieved.  The specific flaw exists within the lcfd.exe process which listens by default on TCP port 9495. To reach this page remotely authentication is required. However, by abusing a built-in account an attacker can access the restricted pages. While parsing requests to one of these, the process blindly copies the contents of a POST variable to a 256 byte stack buffer. This can be leveraged by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the SYSTEM user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | IBM has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:  <https://www-304.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499146> |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2010-11-23 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2011-05-31 - Coordinated public release of advisory |
