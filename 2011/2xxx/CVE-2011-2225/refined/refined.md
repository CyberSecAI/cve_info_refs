{
  "CVE-2011-2225": {
    "Description": "Unspecified vulnerability in Kiwi before 3.74.2, as used in SUSE Studio 1.1 before 1.1.4, allows attackers to have an unknown impact via a crafted directory pathname that is inserted into config.sh.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization or escaping of directory pathnames before they are inserted into the `config.sh` file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "The impact is described as 'unknown' in the official description, but the included CVSS vector indicates a critical vulnerability with complete compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network access to the SUSE Studio service."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "Ability to provide a crafted directory pathname."
    ],
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is located in the Kiwi tool. The crafted directory is inserted into the `config.sh` file, which suggests that this file is later executed. This could lead to arbitrary code execution due to the lack of proper escaping or sanitization, allowing an attacker to control the execution flow via shell injection."
