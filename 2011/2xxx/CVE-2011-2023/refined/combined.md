Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A0103)

## Topic

An updated squirrelmail package that fixes several security issues is now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

SquirrelMail is a standards-based webmail package written in PHP.

A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail
performed the sanitization of HTML style tag content. A remote attacker
could use this flaw to send a specially-crafted Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extensions (MIME) message that, when opened by a victim, would lead to
arbitrary web script execution in the context of their SquirrelMail
session. (CVE-2011-2023)

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws were found in SquirrelMail. A
remote attacker could possibly use these flaws to execute arbitrary web
script in the context of a victim's SquirrelMail session. (CVE-2010-4555)

An input sanitization flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled the
content of various HTML input fields. A remote attacker could use this
flaw to alter user preference values via a newline character contained in
the input for these fields. (CVE-2011-2752)

It was found that the SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did
not protect against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. If a remote
attacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into
visiting a specially-crafted URL, the attacker could empty the victim's
trash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index
page. (CVE-2011-2753)

SquirrelMail was allowed to be loaded into an HTML sub-frame, allowing a
remote attacker to perform a clickjacking attack against logged in users
and possibly gain access to sensitive user data. With this update, the
SquirrelMail main frame can only be loaded into the top most browser frame.
(CVE-2010-4554)

A flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail handled failed log in attempts. A
user preference file was created when attempting to log in with a password
containing an 8-bit character, even if the username was not valid. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to eventually consume all hard disk
space on the target SquirrelMail server. (CVE-2010-2813)

A flaw was found in the SquirrelMail Mail Fetch plug-in. If an
administrator enabled this plug-in, a SquirrelMail user could use this flaw
to port scan the local network the server was on. (CVE-2010-1637)

Users of SquirrelMail should upgrade to this updated package, which
contains backported patches to correct these issues.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/kb/docs/DOC-11259>

                 CVE-2011-2752 CVE-2011-2753

Various vulnerabilities have been found in SquirrelMail, a webmail
application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2010-4554

  SquirrelMail did not prevent page rendering inside a third-party
  HTML frame, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
  clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site.

CVE-2010-4555, CVE-2011-2752, CVE-2011-2753

  Multiple small bugs in SquirrelMail allowed an attacker to inject
  malicious script into various pages or alter the contents of user
  preferences.

CVE-2011-2023

  It was possible to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a
  crafted STYLE element in an HTML part of an e-mail message.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny5.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21-2.

For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 1.4.22-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.

So you ask them in the cve bug in bugzilla. For example [CVE-2010-4554](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4554) is [bug #720693](show_bug.cgi?id=720693 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4554 SquirrelMail: Prone to clickjacking attacks"). (Bugs you've linked have link to bugzilla in them)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c5)  Michal Hlavinka    2011-09-09 08:50:32 UTC  ``` > I can't answer that, that's question for security team. So you should  > ask them in the cve bug in bugzilla.  Which you did. I've missed what the product/component/assignee of this bug really is.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-09 10:43:01 UTC  ``` Hello William,    thank you for contacting us.  (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c3)) > Is there a plan to backport fixes for this, and similar recent security issues: >  >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4554> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4555> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2023> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2752> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2753> >  > to the RHEL 5 packages (Squirrelmail 1.4.8)? It doesn't look like any security > fixes have gone into EL5 since back in 10/09.  We are currently working on squirrelmail package updates, which would address the security flaws you list above. Unfortunately right now, we are not able to provide exact date, when the updated packages will be available for download, as this act depends on many conditions and the final date may be subject of change.  Hope this helps. Let us know, if we can be of any further help.  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c7)  William Yardley    2011-09-09 16:56:59 UTC  ``` Thank you. I've also opened up ticket #00528045 with Red Hat support if that matters.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-08 19:47:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0103 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0103.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-12 14:21:50 UTC  ``` An cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in the way SquirrelMail performed sanitization of MIME messages containing certain <style> HTML tags. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted message, which once opened in SquirrelMail webmail client could lead to arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code execution.  Upstream advisory: [1] <http://www.squirrelmail.org/security/issue/2011-07-10>  Relevant patch: [2] <http://squirrelmail.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/squirrelmail?view=revision&revision=14121>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-12 14:23:14 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the squirrelmail package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  --  This issue affects the version of the squirrelmail package, as present within EPEL-6 repository. Please schedule an update.  --  This issue affects the versions of the squirrelmail package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-12 14:26:06 UTC  ``` Created squirrelmail tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 720696](show_bug.cgi?id=720696 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4554 CVE-2010-4555 CVE-2011-2023 squirrelmail various flaws [epel-6]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 720697](show_bug.cgi?id=720697 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2010-4554 CVE-2010-4555 CVE-2011-2023 squirrelmail various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c3)  William Yardley    2011-09-09 02:57:09 UTC  ``` Is there a plan to backport fixes for this, and similar recent security issues:   <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4554>  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4555>  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2023>  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2752>  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2753>  to the RHEL 5 packages (Squirrelmail 1.4.8)? It doesn't look like any security fixes have gone into EL5 since back in 10/09.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c4)  Michal Hlavinka    2011-09-09 08:48:09 UTC  ``` I can't answer that, that's question for security team. So you ask them in the cve bug in bugzilla. For example [CVE-2010-4554](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-4554) is [bug #720693](show_bug.cgi?id=720693 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2010-4554 SquirrelMail: Prone to clickjacking attacks"). (Bugs you've linked have link to bugzilla in them)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c5)  Michal Hlavinka    2011-09-09 08:50:32 UTC  ``` > I can't answer that, that's question for security team. So you should  > ask them in the cve bug in bugzilla.  Which you did. I've missed what the product/component/assignee of this bug really is.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c6)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-09-09 10:43:01 UTC  ``` Hello William,    thank you for contacting us.  (In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c3)) > Is there a plan to backport fixes for this, and similar recent security issues: >  >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4554> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-4555> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2023> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2752> >  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-2753> >  > to the RHEL 5 packages (Squirrelmail 1.4.8)? It doesn't look like any security > fixes have gone into EL5 since back in 10/09.  We are currently working on squirrelmail package updates, which would address the security flaws you list above. Unfortunately right now, we are not able to provide exact date, when the updated packages will be available for download, as this act depends on many conditions and the final date may be subject of change.  Hope this helps. Let us know, if we can be of any further help.  Thank you && Regards, Jan. -- Jan iankko Lieskovsky / Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c7)  William Yardley    2011-09-09 16:56:59 UTC  ``` Thank you. I've also opened up ticket #00528045 with Red Hat support if that matters.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=720695#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-02-08 19:47:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:0103 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0103.html>   ``` |  |
