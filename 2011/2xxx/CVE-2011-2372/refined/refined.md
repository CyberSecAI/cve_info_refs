Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of websites to trigger a download dialog in Firefox (and related products like Thunderbird and Iceape/Icedove) while a user is holding down the Enter key.
*   The download dialog defaults to the "Open" action, so the continued Enter key presses activate this default action, potentially executing downloaded files without explicit user consent.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unintentional Execution:** The primary issue is that holding down the Enter key can bypass the intended user confirmation step before executing a downloaded file.
*   **Default "Open" Action:** The download dialog's default selection of "Open" creates an exploitable scenario.
*   **Keyboard Buffer Handling:** The keyboard input isn't correctly maintained or flushed when the download prompt gains focus, leading to unintended activation of the "Open" action.
*   **.jar as Executable:** Specifically on Windows, .jar files are not marked as executable, even though they effectively are.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's system. This is because some file types, when "opened," can execute code, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in associated applications.
*   **Malware Installation:**  Malicious pages could install malware without explicit user consent.
*   **Circumventing Security Measures:**  The vulnerability bypasses security measures designed to protect users from untrusted internet content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker hosts a specially crafted webpage.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker convinces the user to hold down the Enter key (e.g., through a game or test).
*   **Download Trigger:** The malicious website triggers a file download, prompting the download dialog.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Web Server/Hosting:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the user into holding down the Enter key.
*   **Target Vulnerability Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know that the target user is using a vulnerable version of Firefox, Thunderbird, Iceape/Icedove, or SeaMonkey and is likely to download and "open" certain file types.

**Mitigation:**

*   Making "Save" the default option in the dialog
*   Implementing delay before OK button is enabled
*   Removing "Open with" as a default action

This level of detail significantly expands upon the basic CVE description.
