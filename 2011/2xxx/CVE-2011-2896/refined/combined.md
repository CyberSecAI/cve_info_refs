| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:22:38 UTC  ``` GIF image file format readers in various open source projects are based on the GIF decoder implementation written by David Koblas.  This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress ([CVE-2011-2895](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2895), [bug #727624](show_bug.cgi?id=727624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 BSD compress LZW decoder buffer overflow")), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.  Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:  <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>  In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte():          if (code >= max_code) {             *sp++ = firstcode;             code = oldcode;         }  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          while (code >= clear_code) {             *sp++ = table[1][code];             if (code == table[0][code])                 pm_error("circular table entry BIG ERROR");             code = table[0][code];         }  where:    #define MAX_LWZ_BITS        12   static int  table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)];   static int  stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp;   sp = stack;  This results in stack[] buffer overflow.  If table[][] is located above stack[], stack[] overflow may further modify decoding table and break infinite loop.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:25:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516471](attachment.cgi?id=516471 "giftoppm.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516471&action=edit "giftoppm.c") giftoppm.c  Local copy of the giftoppm.c, extracted from pbmplus_10dec1991.tar.gz, available from: <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:26:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516472](attachment.cgi?id=516472 "Test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516472&action=edit "Test case") Test case  From [bug #714118](show_bug.cgi?id=714118), already public via <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 10:09:02 UTC  ``` As noted above, this GIF reader code is used in several open source projects.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:22:38 UTC  ``` GIF image file format readers in various open source projects are based on the GIF decoder implementation written by David Koblas.  This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress ([CVE-2011-2895](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2895), [bug #727624](show_bug.cgi?id=727624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 BSD compress LZW decoder buffer overflow")), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.  Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:  <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>  In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte():          if (code >= max_code) {             *sp++ = firstcode;             code = oldcode;         }  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          while (code >= clear_code) {             *sp++ = table[1][code];             if (code == table[0][code])                 pm_error("circular table entry BIG ERROR");             code = table[0][code];         }  where:    #define MAX_LWZ_BITS        12   static int  table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)];   static int  stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp;   sp = stack;  This results in stack[] buffer overflow.  If table[][] is located above stack[], stack[] overflow may further modify decoding table and break infinite loop.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:25:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516471](attachment.cgi?id=516471 "giftoppm.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516471&action=edit "giftoppm.c") giftoppm.c  Local copy of the giftoppm.c, extracted from pbmplus_10dec1991.tar.gz, available from: <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:26:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516472](attachment.cgi?id=516472 "Test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516472&action=edit "Test case") Test case  From [bug #714118](show_bug.cgi?id=714118), already public via <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 10:09:02 UTC  ``` As noted above, this GIF reader code is used in several open source projects.

Subject: LZW decompression issues

Hi!

We've recently came across an issue in commonly re-used LZW
decompression implementations - original BSD compress and GIF reader
written by David Koblas.  Due to an insufficient input checking, invalid
LZW stream can create a loop in the decompression table, leading to the
decompression stack buffer overflow.

Following bugzillas list various code bases that were checked for the
issue and if they are affected or not:
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2895>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2896>

Many code bases are unaffected as the problem was fixed in the past,
so this is probably like N-th re-discovery of the issue.  Some previous
fixes were called security (CVE-2006-1168), some were not.  The problem
may not be security relevant, or have much security impact in all
currently affected code bases, though please mail the list if you come
across any other affected code base that is not already mentioned and
that may be worth fixing.

                 CVE-2011-1782 CVE-2011-2896

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.

CVE-2010-4540
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response
	function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the "LIGHTING
	EFFECTS > LIGHT" plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers
	to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a long Position field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4541
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in
	plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the SPHERE DESIGNER
	plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
	of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
	code via a long "Number of lights" field in a plugin
	configuration file.

CVE-2010-4542
	Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig_read_parameter_gimp_rgb
	function in in the GFIG plugin allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a long Foreground field in a
	plugin configuration file.

CVE-2010-4543
	Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in
	file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE
	compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end
	of the image.

CVE-2011-1782
	The correction for CVE-2010-4543 was incomplete.

CVE-2011-2896
	The LZW decompressor in the LZWReadByte function in
	plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c does not properly handle code
	words that are absent from the decompression table when
	encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an
	infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
	execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1+squeeze3.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.11-5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-10 13:28:05 UTC  ``` A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Adobe Photoshop(tm) PSD plug-in of Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, performed decoding of headers, when loading certain Adobe Photoshop image files. A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened in Gimp would lead to PSD plug-in crash or, potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running gimp executable.  This issue was found by Jan Lieskovsky of the Red Hat Security Response Team   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2012-07-11 15:52:27 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2012-3402](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2012-3402) has been assigned to this issue.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c4)  Nils Philippsen    2012-08-08 15:35:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 603059](attachment.cgi?id=603059&action=diff "Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=603059&action=edit "Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402") Patch to fix CVEs 2009-3909 and 2012-3402   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=838941#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2012-08-20 13:45:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5  Via RHSA-2012:1181 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-1181.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:22:38 UTC  ``` GIF image file format readers in various open source projects are based on the GIF decoder implementation written by David Koblas.  This implementation contains a bug in the LZW decompressor, causing it to in correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in this GIF reading code allows code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  This problem is identical to a bug found in BSD compress ([CVE-2011-2895](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2895), [bug #727624](show_bug.cgi?id=727624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 BSD compress LZW decoder buffer overflow")), but given the unclear relationship between BSD compress and GIF decoder code bases, separate CVE is used here.  Several projects refer to pbmplus as the source form where GIF reading code was taken:  <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>  In pbmplus version of the code, the flaw can be found in LWZReadByte():          if (code >= max_code) {             *sp++ = firstcode;             code = oldcode;         }  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:          while (code >= clear_code) {             *sp++ = table[1][code];             if (code == table[0][code])                 pm_error("circular table entry BIG ERROR");             code = table[0][code];         }  where:    #define MAX_LWZ_BITS        12   static int  table[2][(1<< MAX_LWZ_BITS)];   static int  stack[(1<<(MAX_LWZ_BITS))*2], *sp;   sp = stack;  This results in stack[] buffer overflow.  If table[][] is located above stack[], stack[] overflow may further modify decoding table and break infinite loop.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:25:13 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516471](attachment.cgi?id=516471 "giftoppm.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516471&action=edit "giftoppm.c") giftoppm.c  Local copy of the giftoppm.c, extracted from pbmplus_10dec1991.tar.gz, available from: <http://www.acme.com/software/pbmplus/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 09:26:41 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516472](attachment.cgi?id=516472 "Test case") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516472&action=edit "Test case") Test case  From [bug #714118](show_bug.cgi?id=714118), already public via <http://cups.org/str.php?L3867>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=727800#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-03 10:09:02 UTC  ``` As noted above, this GIF reader code is used in several open source projects.

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1181)

## Topic

Updated gimp packages that fix multiple security issues are now available
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
editing program.

Multiple integer overflow flaws, leading to heap-based buffer overflows,
were found in the GIMP's Adobe Photoshop (PSD) image file plug-in. An
attacker could create a specially-crafted PSD image file that, when opened,
could cause the PSD plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2009-3909,
CVE-2012-3402)

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
decompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format
plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,
when opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.
(CVE-2011-2896)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

Red Hat would like to thank Secunia Research for reporting CVE-2009-3909,
and Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team for reporting
CVE-2012-3481.

Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c0)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 16:00:47 UTC  ``` BSD compress implemented an LZW compressor and decompressor.  This decompressor implementation did not correctly handle compressed streams that contain code words that were not yet added to the decompression table.  LZW decompression has a special case (a KwKwK string) when code word may match the first free entry in the decompression table.  The implementation used in BSD compress allow code words not only matching, but also exceeding the first free entry.  It seems this compress implementation first appeared in BSD around 1985, and was later used in various other code base, such as ncompress and gzip.  Other components that contain affected code will be listed below.  Following page list the version of the code as was used in 4.3BSD:  <http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD-Reno/src/usr.bin/compress/compress.c>  Relevant code appears in the decompress() routine:  	/* 	 * Special case for KwKwK string. 	 */ 	if ( code >= free_ent ) {             *stackp++ = finchar; 	    code = oldcode; 	}  This allows creating a loop in the decompression table, which leads to an "infinite" loop:  	/* 	 * Generate output characters in reverse order 	 */ #ifdef SIGNED_COMPARE_SLOW 	while ( ((unsigned long)code) >= ((unsigned long)256) ) { #else 	while ( code >= 256 ) { #endif 	    *stackp++ = tab_suffixof(code); 	    code = tab_prefixof(code); 	}  where tab_prefixof is:    unsigned short codetab [HSIZE];   #define codetabof(i)	codetab[i]   #define tab_prefixof(i)	codetabof(i)  This overflows de_stack "buffer" (part of the htab[]):    count_int htab [HSIZE];   # define tab_suffixof(i)	((char_type *)(htab))[i]   # define de_stack		((char_type *)&tab_suffixof(1<<BITS))  Depending on the relative htab[] and codetab[] positions, de_stack overflow may overwrite codetab[] entries, which may break infinite loop and let program continue its execution with possibly corrupted memory.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c1)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 18:13:21 UTC  ``` Following projects embed this BSD compress code and have fixed this issue already, either by aborting compression when code > free_ent is encountered, or by protecting against de_stack overflow in the while loop.  ncompress - code > free_ent check <http://ncompress.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=ncompress/ncompress;a=blob;f=compress.c;h=c16e1239#l1167>  gzip - code > free_ent check <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gzip.git;a=blob;f=unlzw.c;h=63f941c6#l297>  libarchive - code > free_ent check <http://code.google.com/p/libarchive/source/browse/trunk/libarchive/archive_read_support_filter_compress.c?r=3195#375>  busybox's libarchive - code > free_ent check <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/archival/libarchive/decompress_uncompress.c?id=833d4e7f#n220>  OpenBSD compress - stack overflow check <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.bin/compress/zopen.c#rev1.17> It seems this fix never made it to other BSDs as FreeBSD or NetBSD.  The version from NetBSD was used in older freetype versions for some time: <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/log/src/lzw/zopen.c> <http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/freetype/freetype2.git/tree/src/lzw/zopen.c?id=a1c990a6#n251> freetype version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 (2.1.9) contains the code and is affected by this issue.  libXfont contains affected version of the code too: <http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/lib/libXfont/tree/src/fontfile/decompress.c?id=f29f1d68#n249> More details can be found in [bug #725760](show_bug.cgi?id=725760 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2895 libXfont: LZW decompression heap corruption / infinite loop").  Heirloom mailx / nail lzw.c should be based on FreeBSD code: <http://nail.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/nail/nail/lzw.c?revision=1.4&view=markup#l511> The code is used to compress and decompress imap cache file and spam filter database, and is not used to decompress untrusted inputs.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c2)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-02 18:14:52 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 516375](attachment.cgi?id=516375 "4.3BSD compress.c") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=516375&action=edit "4.3BSD compress.c") 4.3BSD compress.c  Local copy of the file from: <http://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=4.3BSD-Reno/src/usr.bin/compress/compress.c>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c5)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-04 11:37:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c1)) > busybox's libarchive - code > free_ent check > <http://git.busybox.net/busybox/tree/archival/libarchive/decompress_uncompress.c?id=833d4e7f#n220>  It seems I was wrong about busybox.  Different code path is used for the first code word.  I'll need to work on additional reproducers to test both code paths.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c8)  Tomas Hoger    2011-08-04 18:25:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=727624#c5)) > It seems I was wrong about busybox.

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2012%3A1180)

## Topic

Updated gimp packages that fix three security issues are now available for
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having moderate
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is an image composition and
editing program.

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the GIMP's GIF image format plug-in. An attacker could create a
specially-crafted GIF image file that, when opened, could cause the GIF
plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3481)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW)
decompression algorithm implementation used by the GIMP's GIF image format
plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted GIF image file that,
when opened, could cause the GIF plug-in to crash or, potentially, execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the GIMP.
(CVE-2011-2896)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the GIMP's KiSS CEL file
format plug-in. An attacker could create a specially-crafted KiSS palette
file that, when opened, could cause the CEL plug-in to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
the GIMP. (CVE-2012-3403)

Red Hat would like to thank Matthias Weckbecker of the SUSE Security Team
for reporting the CVE-2012-3481 issue.

Users of the GIMP are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. The GIMP must be
restarted for the update to take effect.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

# USN-1214-1: GIMP vulnerability

22 September 2011

specially crafted GIF file.

attacker could cause GIMP to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with

the user's privileges.
