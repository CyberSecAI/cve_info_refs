  "CVE-2011-2783": {
    "Description": "Always confirm a developer mode NPAPI extension install via a browser dialog.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of confirmation dialog when installing NPAPI extensions in developer mode.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Lack of user confirmation for extension installation"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially install a malicious NPAPI extension without the user's explicit consent, leading to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities within the browser.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker would need to trick the user into enabling developer mode, and then find a way to trigger the installation of a malicious NPAPI extension.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to have some level of control or influence over the user's browser environment to convince them to enable developer mode and also have the malicious extension prepared for installation."
