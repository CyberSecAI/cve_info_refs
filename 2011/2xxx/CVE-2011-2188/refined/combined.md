Subject: CVE Request -- LuaExpat -- Prone to XML "billion laughs attack"

Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

   It was found that LuaExpat, a SAX XML parser based on the Expat
library, is prone to XML "billion laughs attack", as described in:
[1]
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html#N100F1>

A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which
once opened in an application, linked against LuaExpat, could cause
that application to crash.

References:
[2] <http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=629225>
[3] <http://matthewwild.co.uk/projects/luaexpat/luaexpat-1.2.0.tar.gz>
[4] <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=711027>

Could you allocate a CVE id for this?

Thank you & Regards, Jan.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Version 1.1.x of lua-expat exposes application to the DoS explained at:

  <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html#N100F1>

Version 1.2.0 (Released to cope with that) adds a couple of API to let
application
protect from this kind of attack.

----- Original Message -----
> Hello, Josh, Steve, vendors,

> [1]
> <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipcfsx/index.html#N100F1>
>
> A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted XML file, which

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.
