Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the base address for fixed performance monitoring counters (PMU) on Intel x86 processors within the Linux kernel. A previous commit (41bf498) introduced a change that removed the base + index notation for accessing PMU MSRs. However, this new calculation failed to account for the specific index of each fixed counter. Consequently, all fixed counters were being read from and written to the same memory location, effectively fixed counter 0, despite each having its own counter register.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect MSR Access:** The core issue is the erroneous calculation of the memory address used to access the fixed performance counters.
*   **Lack of Indexing:** The code failed to properly differentiate between the multiple fixed counters, treating them as a single entity at the base address.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Denial of Service:** This incorrect addressing leads to unexpected behavior of the performance monitoring subsystem. It can also lead to a system crash as seen in comment #15 of the Red Hat Bugzilla entry. When the performance monitoring system attempts to write to the same memory location, race conditions may arise, and these are likely to cause a system lockup or crash as the interrupt handler might be corrupted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker would need local access to the system to utilize the performance monitoring subsystem and trigger this issue. The `perf` subsystem is the primary attack vector for this vulnerability, and any program that uses it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the affected system. They don't need root privileges to trigger the bug but will need the ability to use the perf subsystem.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `41bf498` and fixed by commit `fc66c52`.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG were not affected as the problematic commit `41bf498` was not backported to those releases.
*   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 was affected and addressed by RHSA-2011:1350.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entry ([Bug 719228](show_bug.cgi?id=719228)) provides a clear timeline of the issue and its resolution.

In summary, CVE-2011-2521 is a local denial-of-service vulnerability caused by an incorrect calculation of memory addresses for accessing Intel x86 fixed performance counters in the Linux kernel. This error led to all counters reading from and writing to the same location, creating a race condition that could crash the system or lead to other unexpected behavior.
