The provided content relates to CVE-2011-2165, which is associated with the STARTTLS plaintext command injection vulnerability (VU#555316).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the switch from plaintext to TLS being implemented below the application's I/O buffering layer. This allows commands sent during the plaintext phase of the protocol to be buffered and then executed during the encrypted TLS phase.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of application I/O buffers when switching from plaintext to TLS.
- Failure to purge the application's I/O buffer immediately after switching to TLS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A remote attacker with the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack can inject commands for the corresponding protocol (e.g., SMTP, POP3, etc.) during the plaintext phase. These injected commands will then be executed during the subsequent ciphertext phase, potentially allowing the attacker to compromise the target system or access sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack.
- Exploitation of STARTTLS implementations that do not properly manage I/O buffers during the switch to TLS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and server.
- Unauthenticated access to the vulnerable service.

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability is only of concern for implementations that perform correct certificate validation.
- The document lists multiple affected vendors, including Cyrus-IMAP, Debian GNU/Linux, Ipswitch, Inc., Kerio Technologies, Postfix, Qmail-TLS, Red Hat, Inc., Sun Microsystems, Inc., Ubuntu, and Watchguard Technologies, Inc.
- The vulnerability affects various protocols that use STARTTLS, such as SMTP and POP3.
- Mitigation involves purging the application's I/O buffer immediately after switching to TLS.
- Some vendors have released patches to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Wietse Venema.
- Several related CVE IDs are also listed, including CVE-2011-0411, CVE-2011-1430, CVE-2011-1431, CVE-2011-1432, and CVE-2011-1575.
