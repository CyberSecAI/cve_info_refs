Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2720:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The GLPI (Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique) software did not properly blacklist certain sensitive variables, such as usernames and passwords. This means that these variables were not adequately protected from unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insufficient input validation or sanitization of HTTP POST request data
- Lack of proper blacklisting of sensitive fields/variables
- Exposure of sensitive information in plaintext

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to obtain plaintext usernames and passwords used within GLPI. This would enable an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the GLPI system and potentially other systems if the same credentials were re-used.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is a specially-crafted HTTP POST request. This indicates the vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the GLPI server.
- The attacker can be a remote, unauthenticated user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was present in GLPI.
- Patches were made available to address this vulnerability by properly blacklisting sensitive fields.
- The patches were released as revisions 14951, 14952, 14954, 14955, 14956, 14957, 14958, 14960 and 14966.
