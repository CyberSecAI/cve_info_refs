## The Document Foundation

* It is an independent self-governing meritocratic entity, created by a large group of Free Software advocates, in the form of a charitable Foundation under German law (gemeinn√É¬ºtzige rechtsf√É¬§hige Stiftung des b√É¬ºrgerlichen Rechts).
* It continues to build on the foundation of the dedicated work by the OpenOffice.org Community.
* It was created in the belief that the culture born of an independent Foundation brings out the best in contributors and will deliver the best software for users.
* It is open to any individual who agrees with our core values and contributes to our activities.
* It welcomes corporate participation, e.g. by sponsoring individuals to work as equals alongside other contributors in the community.

The Document Foundation is proud to be the home of [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/ "LibreOffice"), the next evolution of the world‚Äôs leading free office suite, and [The Document Liberation Project](https://www.documentliberation.org/ "The Document Liberation Project"), a community of developers united to free users from vendor lock-in of content by providing powerful tools for the conversion of proprietary file formats to the corresponding ODF format.

**LibreOffice is a privacy-oriented office suite that runs on your own computer and doesn‚Äôt include AI features out-of-the-box. But we know that many users are interested in combining AI tools with the suite, so we talked to John Balis who is working on a (fully optional!) LibreOffice extension called [localwriter](https://github.com/balisujohn/localwriter). Here‚Äôs what he had to say‚Ä¶**

**Dione Maddern** and The Documentation Team are proud to announce the immediate availability of the **LibreOffice Calc Guide 24.8**, an update of the existing Calc Guide 24.2 with enhancements taken from the current LibreOffice 24.8 Calc module.

[![Calc Guide 24.8](https://blog.documentfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CoverCalc248-724x1024.png)](http://books.libreoffice.org)

The book was reviewed for clarity, readability and content additions, notably the **Calc database table referencing in formulas**, removal of deprecated JavaScript debugger and refactoring of the Calc‚Äôs chart topic ‚Äì in which the chapter on charts was split in two, one for the chart basics and the second for the chart types.‚Ä¶

### What does the template do?

At its core, the template is meant to emulate what a game of Jeopardy is like. You can click on any of the squares on the game board and it will send you to the slide with the associated question, where you can either return to the board in the case of a misclick, or reveal the answer to the question.‚Ä¶

# LibreOffice: Multiple vulnerabilities ‚Äî GLSA **201209-05**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibreOffice, allowing
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a Denial of Service.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.5.3** |

| Package | **app-office/libreoffice-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.5.5.3** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.5.5.3** |

### Background

LibreOffice is a full office productivity suite.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in LibreOffice:

* The Microsoft Word Document parser contains an out-of-bounds read
  error (CVE-2011-2713).
* The Raptor RDF parser contains an XML External Entity expansion error
  (CVE-2012-0037).
* The graphic loading parser contains an integer overflow error which
  could cause a heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-1149).
* Multiple errors in the XML manifest handling code could cause a
  heap-based buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2665).

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted
document file using LibreOffice, possibly resulting in execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service
condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-3.5.5.3"

```

All users of the LibreOffice binary package should upgrade to the latest
version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

### Background

OpenOffice is the open source version of StarOffice, a full office
productivity suite. LibreOffice is a fork of OpenOffice.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice and
Libreoffice. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for
details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted file
using OpenOffice, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process, a Denial of Service condition, execution
of arbitrary Python code, authentication bypass, or reading and writing
of arbitrary files.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/openoffice-bin-3.5.5.3"

```

All LibreOffice users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-office/libreoffice-4.2.5.2"

```

All LibreOffice (binary) users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose
 ">=app-office/libreoffice-bin-4.2.5.2"

```

We recommend that users unmerge OpenOffice:

```
 # emerge --unmerge "app-office/openoffice"

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world‚Äôs best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft‚Äôs Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren‚Äôt normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

This has been assigned [CVE-2011-2713](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2713).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=725668#c2)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2011-10-05 10:40:46 UTC  ``` It initially appeared that this flaw may be exploitable similar to [CVE-2010-3452](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2010-3452), where an OOB Read caused Arbitrary Code Execution. However in the case of this particular flaw, the junk data read is just parsed into an internal representation of properties and the maximum harm this should cause in application crash (Denial Of Service).   Timeline: - Reported to securityteam on 25-July-2011 - Recieved a reply (with tdf-security.org copied) on the same date  - Release date changed with a few delays in between - Release on 5-Oct-2011   Statement:  This issue results in an OOB read which is not exploitable for arbitrary code execution and can simply cause a crash. We do not consider this as a security issue.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=725668#c15)  Murray McAllister    2012-10-03 04:20:13 UTC  ``` Acknowledgements:  This issue was discovered by Huzaifa Sidhpurwala of the Red Hat Security Response Team.   ``` |  |
