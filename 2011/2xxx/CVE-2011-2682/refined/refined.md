Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in APAR PM38477, which is related to the provided CVE:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in how IBM Rational DOORS Web Access (DWA) handled the password change logic for new users. When a new user attempted to log in to DWA for the first time (without having logged into the Rational DOORS client), the system incorrectly tried to acquire a license during the password change process, before actual authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect License Acquisition:** DWA was acquiring a license even when the login failed due to the new user not having an initial password set. This license was not released.
- **Failed Login for New Users:** The password change logic did not function correctly for new users. New users were unable to set their passwords upon their first login, instead they would receive a 'failed_bad_credentials' error.
- **License Starvation:** Unreleased licenses could cause a denial of service by preventing other users from logging in, requiring a server reboot to free licenses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition due to the exhaustion of licenses. When new users attempt to log in, licenses are checked out but not released when the login fails.
- **Inability to Login:** New users were unable to log in to Rational DOORS Web Access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **New User Login Attempt:** The attack vector involves simply attempting to log in as a new user (one who hasn't logged into the Rational DOORS client before) to DWA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be a new user that has been created in Rational DOORS and is attempting to log in to DWA for the first time. They would not need any special privileges beyond being a valid user in the system.

**Additional Information:**
The fix involved changing the logic so that a license is only acquired after the login/authentication has occurred, and password changes were moved to the authentication step instead of the login attempt.
