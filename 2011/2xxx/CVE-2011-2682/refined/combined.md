# PM38477: New user failed login checks out a DWA license and does not release it

## Subscribe

You can track all active APARs for this component.

##

## APAR status

* ### Closed as program error.

## Error description

* ```
  DOORS 9.3.0.3
  DWA 1.4.0.3 (Windows 2003 SP 2)
  License Server TL 2.0 (Windows 2003 SP2)

  Problem Description:

  When a user tries to log into DOORS Web Access for the first
  time it should prompt them to pick a new password but it
  doesn't. We get the error 'failed_bad_credentials' and doesn't
  get any further.  On the server the license server has checked
  out a license to the user attempting to log in and doesn't then
  relinquish the license and we have to reboot the server in order
  to free up the licenses. The DOORS client licenses are behaving
  normally it is only with Web Access and only with new users.

  Steps to Reproduce:

  1. Create a new user in DOORS
  2. Log in to DWA with this user with out log in into DOORS

  ```

## Local fix

  * USERS AFFECTED:                                              *

  * PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:                                         *

  * RECOMMENDATION:                                              *
  ****************************************************************
  Although the login was failing for a new user, a license was
  being acquired.

  ```

## Problem conclusion

* ```
  The Change Password logic now no longer acquires a password
  - this is solely performed in the actual login /
  authentication code.

  ```
