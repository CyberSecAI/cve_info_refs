Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how the Cherokee web server generates admin passwords. Specifically, the `srand` function is seeded using a combination of the current time and the process ID (PID) of the admin process, then `rand()` is used to generate the password. This method produces predictable "random" numbers, making the generated passwords weak and susceptible to guessing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Predictable password generation due to insufficient entropy in the random number generation.
- Weak seeding of the random number generator (`srand`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker, particularly a local user, can fairly easily guess the admin password.
- This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the Cherokee server's administrative interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access. An attacker needs to have local access to the system on which Cherokee is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- No special privileges are required other than the ability to observe the system time and process IDs.
- The attacker also needs to know that Cherokee is being used as an admin server to exploit the weak password generation.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is that `srand` is seeded with low entropy data, therefore the passwords generated by `rand` are predictable and thus, weak.
- The vulnerability was initially reported in a public issue tracker and then discussed on the oss-security mailing list.
- The issue was addressed with updates to Cherokee that provided a better approach to admin password generation.

This analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description, which simply indicates a weak password generation issue.
