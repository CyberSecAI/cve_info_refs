| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-14 22:25:21 UTC  ``` Two flaws were reported in Cherokee.  The first ([CVE-2011-2191](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2191)) is that the Cherokee server admin configuration web interface is vulnerable to CSRF.  If an admin is logged into the Cherokee admin interface and visits a site which runs a malicious script, Cherokee can be reconfigured to execute arbitrary commands [1].  It is also vulnerable to use the CSRF to produce a persistant XSS [2].  The second ([CVE-2011-2090](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2090)) is that Cherokee seeds srand with a combination of the time and the PID of the admin process, after which rand() is called to generate a random password -- this is unsafe and allows for fairly easy local password guessing by a local user [3].  [1] <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2011/Jun/0> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/03/6> [3] <http://code.google.com/p/cherokee/issues/detail?id=1212>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c1)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-14 22:27:05 UTC  ``` Created cherokee tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 713306](show_bug.cgi?id=713306 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2190 CVE-2011-2191 cherokee: multiple vulnerabilities [fedora-all]")] Affects: epel-all [[bug 713307](show_bug.cgi?id=713307 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2190 CVE-2011-2191 cherokee: multiple vulnerabilities [epel-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c2)  Kurt Seifried    2011-06-15 01:34:22 UTC  ``` Partial duplicate to 710471 ([CVE-2011-2190](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2190))   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c3)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-15 20:35:48 UTC  ``` Ahh, didn't see we had a bug for that already.  Thanks!   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-10-19 14:44:14 UTC  ``` This issue has been resolved via the following updates: 1) cherokee-1.2.101-1.fc15 for Fedora 15, 2) cherokee-1.2.101-1.fc14 for Fedora 14, 3) cherokee-1.2.101-1.el6 for Fedora EPEL 6, 4) cherokee-1.2.101-1.el5 for Fedora EPEL 5, 5) cherokee-1.2.101-1.el4 for Fedora EPEL 4.  These updated packages have been pushed to -testing repository, and upon their required testing is complete, they will be pushed to -stable repository.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=713304#c5)  Gunnar Wolf    2012-03-09 16:22:19 UTC  ``` This bug consists of two separate issues. AFAICT, the second one has been dealt with, but the first one is still open.  I am not really familiar with RedHat's workflow, but at least I have been unable to find anything fixing the CSRF bug, short of this mail sent by the upstream author, stating he has not found a way to solve it:    <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/06/13>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).
