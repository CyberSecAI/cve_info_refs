Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that `new->user_ns` is not initialized in the `key_replace_session_keyring` function when the credential (`cred`) is not created using `copy_creds()`. This leads to `targ_ns` being NULL in the `cap_capable()` function. This was introduced by commit `47a150edc2ae734c0f4bf50aa19499` in Linux kernel version 2.6.39.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uninitialized Variable:** The core issue is the uninitialized `new->user_ns` variable, which should point to a valid user namespace.
- **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The lack of initialization leads to a NULL pointer dereference when `cap_capable()` attempts to access the user namespace through `targ_ns`, causing a kernel panic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Kernel Crash/Denial of Service:** The immediate impact is a kernel crash due to the NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly demonstrated in provided text, the bug occurs in capability checks, therefore could potentially be used for privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the credentials of a process using the `keyctl` system call to trigger the vulnerable code path, followed by a `setgid` system call, which invokes `cap_capable()` and triggers the NULL pointer dereference.
- The provided exploit code uses `clone` to create a new process, sets a session key via `keyctl`, then makes the `setgid` syscall to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **User-space Access:** An attacker only needs to be able to execute user-space code on the target system.
- **Ability to Use Keyctl System Call:** An attacker needs to be able to make the `keyctl` system call with `KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT` and the `setgid` system call.
- **Apparmor or SELinux loaded:** The vulnerability is triggered in the `cap_capable` function, which is called by both Apparmor and SELinux security modules.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered using a tool named `iknowthis` by Tavis Ormandy.
- The vulnerability is a regression introduced after 2.6.39-rc4 and is present in 2.6.39
- A patch was proposed to fix this issue by initializing `new->user_ns` in `key_replace_session_keyring` with the value of  `new->user->user_ns`.
