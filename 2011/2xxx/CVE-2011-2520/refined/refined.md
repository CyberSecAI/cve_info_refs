Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2520:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of Python's `pickle` module in `system-config-firewall`. This module is used to serialize and deserialize messages between the graphical user interface (GUI) and a privileged backend process (`system-config-firewall-mechanism.py`) running as root.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization:** The `pickle` module allows arbitrary Python code to be embedded within the serialized data. When the backend deserializes the pickled data, it executes the embedded code in the context of the root user. This is due to the design of `pickle`, which isn't meant for handling untrusted data.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system doesn't sanitize the pickled data received from the frontend before deserializing it, which allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A local user with the ability to interact with the `system-config-firewall` GUI can escalate their privileges to root by sending specially crafted pickled data to the privileged backend process.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious code within the pickled data, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected system.
- **System Compromise:** This could potentially allow the attacker to fully compromise the system, install backdoors, modify system files, and gain complete control over it.
- **Configuration Manipulation:** Even with SELinux enabled, attackers could modify system configurations, such as `/etc/sysctl.conf`, potentially disabling module loading or initiating reboots. They could also write to `/tmp` and `/etc/sysconfig/system-config-firewall` as root.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system with the ability to run the `system-config-firewall` GUI application.
- **D-Bus Communication:** The attack exploits the communication between the GUI frontend and the privileged backend using the D-Bus message system.
- **Pickle Data Injection:** The attacker crafts malicious Python code, serializes it using `pickle`, and sends it as a message to the backend via D-Bus.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local User:** The attacker must be a local user on the system.
- **GUI Access:** They need the ability to launch and interact with the `system-config-firewall` GUI application.
- **Polkit authorization (Non-default config):** The user must have the ability to configure the firewall through a polkit action like "org.fedoraproject.config.firewall.auth", while not having direct root access or an equivalent account.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is mitigated by replacing the `pickle` module with JSON for message serialization, as JSON does not allow arbitrary code execution during deserialization.
- The vulnerability is most applicable in non-default configurations where a local user has the ability to configure the firewall but not root access.
- Red Hat acknowledged Marco Slaviero of SensePost for reporting the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on July 18, 2011, after a patch was created and distributed to Red Hat customers.
- The vulnerability was initially planned to be publicly disclosed on August 4th at Black Hat USA, but the release was expedited.
- SELinux, in its default configuration, limits the impact, but doesn't completely mitigate the vulnerability.
