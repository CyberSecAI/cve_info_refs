How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-30 15:31:54 UTC  ``` Marco Slaviero reported a flaw in the use of python's pickle module as used in system-config-firewall that could allow local users to elevate their privileges to that of the root user.  The pickle module is used to format messages between the system-config-firewall GUI and the system-config-firewall-mechanism.py privileged backend (that runs as root).  The frontend and backend use D-Bus to communicate with each other, and pickle is known to permit the execution of arbitrary python code, so the untrusted user can send to the backend pickle shellcode that is executed in a privileged context.  The flaw depends on a number of non-standard configurable items to be set:  1) SELinux must be disabled (with SELinux enabled, certain actions can be executed as root, but they are extremely limited) 2) The user must be local, and using a GUI  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Marco Slaviero of SensePost for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-30 15:44:30 UTC  ``` This issue is set to be made public on August 4th at BlackHat USA as part of a talk on vulnerabilities in python pickle.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c4)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-04 09:29:47 UTC  ``` More information:  <http://nadiana.com/python-pickle-insecure>  This includes information on how to make pickle safer, but again suggests that its not 100%. The website also suggests JSON is a good alternative.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c5)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-04 09:31:04 UTC  ``` More pickle fun:  <http://blog.nelhage.com/2011/03/exploiting-pickle/>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c6)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-04 10:40:44 UTC  ``` Tried to modify the script to check if this would disable selinux:  Running it yields the following in the audit logs:  type=USER_AUTH msg=audit(1309793900.311:93): user pid=5032 uid=0 auid=504 ses=1 subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:policykit_auth_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 msg='op=PAM:authentication acct="fw" exe="/usr/libexec/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1" hostname=? addr=? terminal=tty1 res=success' type=USER_ACCT msg=audit(1309793900.314:94): user pid=5032 uid=0 auid=504 ses=1 subj=unconfined_u:unconfined_r:policykit_auth_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 msg='op=PAM:accounting acct="fw" exe="/usr/libexec/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1" hostname=? addr=? terminal=tty1 res=success' type=AVC msg=audit(1309793900.354:95): avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=5036 comm="setenforce" name="enforce" dev=selinuxfs ino=4 scontext=system_u:system_r:firewallgui_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 tcontext=system_u:object_r:security_t:s0 tclass=file type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1309793900.354:95): arch=c000003e syscall=2 success=no exit=-13 a0=7fffb56d8350 a1=2 a2=7fffb56d8360 a3=fffffff8 items=0 ppid=1736 pid=5036 auid=4294967295 uid=0 gid=0 euid=0 suid=0 fsuid=0 egid=0 sgid=0 fsgid=0 tty=(none) ses=4294967295 comm="setenforce" exe="/usr/sbin/setenforce" subj=system_u:system_r:firewallgui_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 key=(null)  Code is executed by pickle as root with the context "system_r:firewallgui_t". Selinux restricts programs with this context from running setenforce or from modifying /selinux/enforce.  It seems that you cant bypass selinux using this issue.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c9)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-05 08:49:07 UTC  ``` This has been assigned [CVE-2011-2520](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2520)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c10)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-05 09:29:53 UTC  ``` Even with selinux enabled, it is possible to write to /etc/sysctl.conf. This could be useful (e.g. disabling module loading) and rebooting. It is also possible to write into /tmp and /etc/sysconfig/system-config-firewall as root.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c11)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-05 09:37:13 UTC  ``` Additionally, this exploit is only useful where the user can configure the firewall, but does not have access to a 'root' equivalent account.  In RHEL6's default configuration, the polkit action 'org.fedoraproject.config.firewall.auth' is only available to members of 'desktop_admin_r' group, which is functionally equivalent to 'root' through`pkexec bash`.  However, this polkit action is required to make firewall changes and to share printers. It is possible in certain environments that an administrator may delegate the ability to modify firewall rules (e.g. to enable file sharing, or printer sharing) to individual users or groups. In this non-default scenario, this privilege escalation bug applies.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c12)  Huzaifa S.

This > could be useful (e.g. disabling module loading) and rebooting. It is also > possible to write into /tmp and /etc/sysconfig/system-config-firewall as root.  Sure, the following in the selinux policy makes it possible:  allow firewallgui_t system_conf_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ;  allow firewallgui_t system_conf_t : dir { ioctl read write getattr lock add_name remove_name search open } ;   Rebooting the machine would get more user attention though :)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c13)  Huzaifa S.

Sidhpurwala    2011-07-07 07:48:13 UTC  ``` Hi Marco,  We have worked out a patch for system-config-firewall and it indeed seems that replacing pickle with json is a good idea. I see that you intend to make this public in BlackHat in August.   Would it be ok to share the vuln. details with other vendors via a private (encrypted) mailing list, along with the details of the date on which this should be made public?.   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c19)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-07 08:02:49 UTC  ``` Hi Huzaifa,  Sure, that will be fine.

Which other vendors make use of > system-config-firewall?  Thank you.  Afaik i dont think any other distros use that. However letting other vendors know would usually let them look at their codebases to see if they were using a similar setup somewhere else.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c21)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-08 06:57:35 UTC  ``` Hi Marco,  Can i confirm a un-embargo date of 04-August-2011?. Do let us know if you want to post-pone or pre-one this. We usually push our updates during US times. I suppose you would like us to wait till your presentation is over on that day?. Would you inform us via this bug, or if you could let us know the time in advance, we could push the update (After your have presented ofcourse :))  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c22)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-08 08:22:06 UTC  ``` Hi Huzaifa,  In truth, I don't think the bug is going to make waves if the update is released ahead of the presentation. I'm don't see any reason not to push the update immediately without waiting for Aug 4, and get your customers patched now.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c23)  Huzaifa S.

Wow, i wanted to ask this question as well, but i thought you would have insisted on the embargo. I am going to get rolling with the updates asap, and will un-embargo this bug once done. Thanks a lot. :)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c26)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-08 09:40:02 UTC  ``` Marco,  Would it be ok, if we credit you in our advisory? If so, are you ok with the following text:  "Red Hat would like to thank Marco Slaviero for reporting this issue."  or should be mention   "Marco Slaviero of SensePost Information Security" ?  thanks.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c27)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-08 10:00:35 UTC  ``` Hi Huzaifa,  Please include 'Marco Slaviero of SensePost'.  thanks   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c29)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-08 13:43:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c28)) > system-config-printer-1.1.16-17.el6_1.1 built. >  > Not sure when I should build the RHEL-6.2 package so as to be sure it won't > leak before the embargo.

Feel free to build and release the updates as you see fit.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c30)  Tim Waugh    2011-07-08 14:28:10 UTC  ``` Thanks.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c32)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-18 17:32:24 UTC  ``` I am making this public and informing oss-security about this flaw now.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c33)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-18 17:33:29 UTC  ``` Created system-config-printer tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 722992](show_bug.cgi?id=722992 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2520 system-config-firewall: privilege escalation flaw via use of python pickle [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c34)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-18 17:33:32 UTC  ``` Created system-config-firewall tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 722991](show_bug.cgi?id=722991 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2520 system-config-firewall: privilege escalation flaw via use of python pickle [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-18 21:08:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0953 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0953.html>   ``` |  |

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Subject: CVE-2011-2520: flaw in system-config-firewall's usage of pickle
 allows privilege escalation

Hi folks.  I'm not sure if anyone else uses system-config-firewall and
system-config-printer, but we had a report of a privilege escalation
flaw that could allow a user with access to run these commands to
elevate their privileges due to insecure use of the python pickle
module.

The solution is to use JSON rather than pickle.  The details and a patch
for CVE-2011-2520 are available in our bugzilla:

<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2011-2520>

Thanks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c0)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-30 15:31:54 UTC  ``` Marco Slaviero reported a flaw in the use of python's pickle module as used in system-config-firewall that could allow local users to elevate their privileges to that of the root user.  The pickle module is used to format messages between the system-config-firewall GUI and the system-config-firewall-mechanism.py privileged backend (that runs as root).  The frontend and backend use D-Bus to communicate with each other, and pickle is known to permit the execution of arbitrary python code, so the untrusted user can send to the backend pickle shellcode that is executed in a privileged context.  The flaw depends on a number of non-standard configurable items to be set:  1) SELinux must be disabled (with SELinux enabled, certain actions can be executed as root, but they are extremely limited) 2) The user must be local, and using a GUI  Acknowledgements:  Red Hat would like to thank Marco Slaviero of SensePost for reporting this issue.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c2)  Vincent Danen    2011-06-30 15:44:30 UTC  ``` This issue is set to be made public on August 4th at BlackHat USA as part of a talk on vulnerabilities in python pickle.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c4)  Huzaifa S.

This could be useful (e.g. disabling module loading) and rebooting. It is also possible to write into /tmp and /etc/sysconfig/system-config-firewall as root.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c11)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-05 09:37:13 UTC  ``` Additionally, this exploit is only useful where the user can configure the firewall, but does not have access to a 'root' equivalent account.  In RHEL6's default configuration, the polkit action 'org.fedoraproject.config.firewall.auth' is only available to members of 'desktop_admin_r' group, which is functionally equivalent to 'root' through`pkexec bash`.  However, this polkit action is required to make firewall changes and to share printers. It is possible in certain environments that an administrator may delegate the ability to modify firewall rules (e.g. to enable file sharing, or printer sharing) to individual users or groups. In this non-default scenario, this privilege escalation bug applies.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c12)  Huzaifa S.

This > could be useful (e.g. disabling module loading) and rebooting. It is also > possible to write into /tmp and /etc/sysconfig/system-config-firewall as root.  Sure, the following in the selinux policy makes it possible:  allow firewallgui_t system_conf_t : file { ioctl read write create getattr setattr lock append unlink link rename open } ;  allow firewallgui_t system_conf_t : dir { ioctl read write getattr lock add_name remove_name search open } ;   Rebooting the machine would get more user attention though :)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c13)  Huzaifa S.

We usually push our updates during US times. I suppose you would like us to wait till your presentation is over on that day?. Would you inform us via this bug, or if you could let us know the time in advance, we could push the update (After your have presented ofcourse :))  Thanks.   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c22)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-08 08:22:06 UTC  ``` Hi Huzaifa,  In truth, I don't think the bug is going to make waves if the update is released ahead of the presentation.

Wow, i wanted to ask this question as well, but i thought you would have insisted on the embargo. I am going to get rolling with the updates asap, and will un-embargo this bug once done. Thanks a lot. :)   ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c26)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-07-08 09:40:02 UTC  ``` Marco,  Would it be ok, if we credit you in our advisory? If so, are you ok with the following text:  "Red Hat would like to thank Marco Slaviero for reporting this issue."  or should be mention   "Marco Slaviero of SensePost Information Security" ?  thanks.   ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c27)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-08 10:00:35 UTC  ``` Hi Huzaifa,  Please include 'Marco Slaviero of SensePost'.  thanks   ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c29)  Marco Slaviero    2011-07-08 13:43:17 UTC  ``` (In reply to [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c28)) > system-config-printer-1.1.16-17.el6_1.1 built. >  > Not sure when I should build the RHEL-6.2 package so as to be sure it won't > leak before the embargo.

Feel free to build and release the updates as you see fit.   ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c30)  Tim Waugh    2011-07-08 14:28:10 UTC  ``` Thanks.   ```  [Comment 32](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c32)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-18 17:32:24 UTC  ``` I am making this public and informing oss-security about this flaw now.   ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c33)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-18 17:33:29 UTC  ``` Created system-config-printer tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 722992](show_bug.cgi?id=722992 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2520 system-config-firewall: privilege escalation flaw via use of python pickle [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c34)  Vincent Danen    2011-07-18 17:33:32 UTC  ``` Created system-config-firewall tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 722991](show_bug.cgi?id=722991 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2011-2520 system-config-firewall: privilege escalation flaw via use of python pickle [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=717985#c35)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-07-18 21:08:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:0953 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0953.html>   ``` |  |
