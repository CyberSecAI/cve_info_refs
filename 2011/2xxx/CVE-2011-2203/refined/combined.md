After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

# USN-1324-1: Linux kernel (EC2) vulnerabilities

11 January 2012

Two security issues were fixed in the kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 10.04](/security/notices?release=lucid)

## Packages

* [linux-ec2](/security/cves?package=linux-ec2) - Linux kernel for EC2

## Details

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker

could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](/security/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An

unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system.

([CVE-2011-4110](/security/CVE-2011-4110))

### Reduce your security exposure

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 10.04

* [linux-image-2.6.32-342-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2)
  -
  [2.6.32-342.43](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-ec2/2.6.32-342.43)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If

you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as

well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you

manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic,

linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically

perform this as well.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=712774#c0)  Eugene Teo (Security Response)    2011-06-13 05:25:24 UTC  ``` hfs_find_init() is wrongly assuming that sb->ext_tree has already been opened and is not NULL but this function can be called when sb->ext_tree is currently being opened (NULL deref).  Indeed when we have the following call path, the NULL deref. occurs:  In hfs_mdb_get() we have (at this stage ext_tree == NULL):   HFS_SB(sb)->ext_tree = hfs_btree_open(sb, HFS_EXT_CNID, hfs_ext_keycmp);  hfs_btree_open() is calling read_mapping_page() which is indirectly a call to hfs_readpage(). Then hfs_readpage() can make the following calls:   hfs_readpage() -> hfs_get_block() -> alloc_buffer_head() -> hfs_ext_read_extent()  Then hfs_ext_read_extent() calls hfs_find_init() with an ext_tree == NULL. Then we have a NULL dereference in hfs_find_init().   ptr = kmalloc(tree->max_key_len (...));  Due to the huge call stack from hfs_btree_open() to hfs_find_init() there are many ways to fix this dereference but I can't find the proper way to fix it.  Moreover if we look at the code in hfs_find_init().   20        ptr = kmalloc(tree->max_key_len * 2 + 4, GFP_KERNEL);  21        if (!ptr)  22                return -ENOMEM;  23        fd->search_key = ptr;  24        fd->key = ptr + tree->max_key_len + 2;  We can make "max_key_len * 2 + 4" wrap and have an fd->key pointing outside of the kmalloc()'ed space. Moreover we can make space in fd->search_key lower than max_key_len and bad things can occur.

Then hfs_readpage() can make the following calls: hfs_readpage() -> hfs_get_block() -> alloc_buffer_head() -> hfs_ext_read_extent()Then hfs_ext_read_extent() calls hfs_find_init() with an ext_tree == NULL. Thenwe have a NULL dereference in hfs_find_init(). ptr = kmalloc(tree->max_key_len (...));Due to the huge call stack from hfs_btree_open() to hfs_find_init() thereare many ways to fix this dereference but I can't find the proper way tofix it.Moreover if we look at the code in hfs_find_init(). 20        ptr = kmalloc(tree->max_key_len * 2 + 4, GFP_KERNEL); 21        if (!ptr) 22                return -ENOMEM; 23        fd->search_key = ptr; 24        fd->key = ptr + tree->max_key_len + 2;We can make "max_key_len * 2 + 4" wrap and have an fd->key pointing outside ofthe kmalloc()'ed space. Moreover we can make space in fd->search_key lowerthan max_key_len and bad things can occur.Here are the Oops for the NULL dereference. If you are interested I canprovide you a fake image device (mount -o loop) which triggers thisdereference.[  435.802462] BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 00000034[  435.803563] IP: [<d9fff69f>] hfs_find_init+0x10/0x45 [hfs][  435.804037] *pde = 00000000[  435.804037] Oops: 0000 [#1] SMP[  435.804037] last sysfs file: /sys/module/nls_base/initstate[  435.804037] Modules linked in: hfs dlm configfs fuse loopsnd_intel8x0 snd_ac97_codec ac97_bus snd_pcm snd_timer parport_pc sndparport psmouse soundcore i2c_piix4 joydev i2c_core ac battery buttonpcspkr evdev serio_raw snd_page_alloc vboxguest ext3 jbd mbcachedm_mod btrfs zlib_deflate crc32c libcrc32c sg usbhid hid sr_mod sd_modcrc_t10dif cdrom ata_generic ata_piix ohci_hcd ahci thermal libataehci_hcd thermal_sys scsi_mod e1000 usbcore nls_base [last unloaded:scsi_wait_scan][  435.804037][  435.804037] Pid: 1321, comm: mount Not tainted (2.6.32-5-686 #1) VirtualBox[  435.804037] EIP: 0060:[<d9fff69f>] EFLAGS: 00010202 CPU: 0[  435.804037] EIP is at hfs_find_init+0x10/0x45 [hfs][  435.804037] EAX: 00000000 EBX: d6e05c64 ECX: 00000000 EDX: d6e05c64[  435.804037] ESI: 00000000 EDI: 00000004 EBP: d6226088 ESP: d6e05c58[  435.804037]  DS: 007b ES: 007b FS: 00d8 GS: 00e0 SS: 0068[  435.804037] Process mount (pid: 1321, ti=d6e04000 task=d6135100task.ti=d6e04000)[  435.804037] Stack:[  435.804037]  00000004 00000000 da002466 00000001 00000246 0000000000000000 c10cd056[  435.804037] <0> 00000040 00000000 d76a7ac0 00000000 00000004d6226000 d6226040 00000004[  435.804037] <0> da002af5 d66a8480 c1767820 d6226088 d5d34e000000003f 00000000 00000004[  435.804037] Call Trace:[  435.804037]  [<da002466>] ? hfs_ext_read_extent+0x42/0x61 [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c10cd056>] ? alloc_buffer_head+0xd/0x34[  435.804037]  [<da002af5>] ? hfs_get_block+0xc9/0x1cc [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c10cfdd8>] ? block_read_full_page+0x15a/0x26e[  435.804037]  [<da002a2c>] ? hfs_get_block+0x0/0x1cc [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c1087b89>] ? do_read_cache_page+0x7e/0xf8[  435.804037]  [<da002da8>] ? hfs_readpage+0x0/0xc [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c1087c30>] ? read_cache_page_async+0x14/0x18[  435.804037]  [<c1087c3d>] ? read_cache_page+0x9/0xf[  435.804037]  [<da0012b8>] ? hfs_btree_open+0x169/0x291 [hfs][  435.804037]  [<da002226>] ? hfs_ext_keycmp+0x0/0x45 [hfs][  435.804037]  [<da004437>] ? hfs_mdb_get+0x530/0x625 [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c10c0d5b>] ? __d_lookup+0x9e/0xd3[  435.804037]  [<da004f1a>] ? hfs_fill_super+0x460/0x47d [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c10c4e5b>] ? mntput_no_expire+0x17/0xb6[  435.804037]  [<c113a1f0>] ? string+0x33/0x81[  435.804037]  [<c113acae>] ? vsnprintf+0x194/0x372[  435.804037]  [<c11b4b33>] ? kobj_lookup+0x132/0x161[  435.804037]  [<c113aeee>] ? snprintf+0x16/0x18[  435.804037]  [<c10ee022>] ? disk_name+0x1f/0x5b[  435.804037]  [<c10b52af>] ? get_sb_bdev+0x11d/0x16f[  435.804037]  [<da004aba>] ? hfs_fill_super+0x0/0x47d [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c10c5830>] ? alloc_vfsmnt+0x7b/0x106[  435.804037]  [<da0048d1>] ? hfs_get_sb+0x12/0x16 [hfs][  435.804037]  [<da004aba>] ? hfs_fill_super+0x0/0x47d [hfs][  435.804037]  [<c10b4f5d>] ? vfs_kern_mount+0x85/0x11c[  435.804037]  [<c10b5032>] ? do_kern_mount+0x2f/0xb8[  435.804037]  [<c10c6380>] ? do_mount+0x64a/0x69e[  435.804037]  [<c113b8d3>] ? copy_from_user+0x27/0x10e[  435.804037]  [<c10c643a>] ? sys_mount+0x66/0x98[  435.804037]  [<c10031dc>] ? syscall_call+0x7/0xb[  435.804037] Code: 43 04 e8 00 f0 0a e7 8b 43 08 83 c0 3c e8 1f 7e04 e7 c7 43 08 00 00 00 00 5b c3 56 89 c6 53 89 d3 89 43 08 c7 42 0c00 00 00 00 <8b> 40 34 ba d0 00 00 00 8d 44 00 04 e8 45 f5 0a e7 89 c2b8 f4[  435.804037] EIP: [<d9fff69f>] hfs_find_init+0x10/0x45 [hfs] SS:ESP0068:d6e05c58[  435.804037] CR2: 0000000000000034Best regards,-- ClÃ©ment LECIGNE,"FreeBSD is ancien beardedland word meaning, I can't implement ASLR."--To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" inthe body of a message to majordomo@vger.kernel.orgMore majordomo info at  <http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html>Please read the FAQ at  <http://www.tux.org/lkml/> ``` | \ |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).
