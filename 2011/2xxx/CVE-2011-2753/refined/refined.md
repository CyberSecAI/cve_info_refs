{
  "CVE-2011-2753": {
    "Description": "Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in SquirrelMail 1.4.21 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of unspecified victims via vectors involving (1) the empty trash implementation and (2) the Index Order (aka options_order) page, a different issue than CVE-2010-4555.",
    "Root cause": "The SquirrelMail Empty Trash and Index Order pages did not implement proper protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CSRF vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could trick a user, who was logged into SquirrelMail, into visiting a specially-crafted URL, allowing the attacker to empty the victim's trash folder or alter the ordering of the columns on the message index page.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, when visited by an authenticated user, would trigger the vulnerable functionality.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to trick an authenticated user into clicking on a malicious link. The attacker does not need to be on the same network, or have access to the server in anyway other than sending a user a crafted link."
