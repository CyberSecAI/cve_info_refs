{
  "CVE-2011-2990": {
    "Description": "Content Security Policy violation reports failed to strip out proxy authorization credentials from the list of request headers. Additionally, redirecting to a website with Content Security Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution of hosts in the constructed policy.",
    "Root cause": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Firefox, specifically how it handled violation reports, did not properly sanitize HTTP request headers before sending them as part of the report, and also had an issue with the resolution of hosts in the constructed policy.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure handling of HTTP request headers in CSP violation reports.",
      "Incorrect resolution of hosts in CSP implementation."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially steal user credentials or other sensitive data contained within HTTP headers (specifically Proxy-Authorization). It also could lead to a website not applying the intended content security policies.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Attacker crafts a website that triggers a Content Security Policy violation",
      "The violation report containing the headers is sent to a server controlled by the attacker",
      "Attacker gains access to sensitive data from the headers (e.g., proxy credentials or cookies)."
    ],
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to create a website or inject malicious code that triggers a Content Security Policy violation.",
      "Control over or access to the server that receives CSP violation reports.",
      "Ability to analyze and extract information from the received violation reports."
    ]
