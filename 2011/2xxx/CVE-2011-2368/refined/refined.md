Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2368:

**Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2011-2368. The SUSE security announcement and the Mozilla security advisory both explicitly mention this CVE ID along with a description of a WebGL crash. Bugzilla also confirms that Bug 657201 is related to the CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `glValidateProgram()` function within the WebGL implementation in Firefox and SeaMonkey. This function, when called on macOS, resulted in crashes due to an invalid memory write.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Invalid Memory Write:** The core issue is an invalid write operation triggered during the program validation process in WebGL. This could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Crash:** The `glValidateProgram` function is causing crashes, indicating a memory corruption issue or incorrect handling of data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker could potentially exploit the invalid memory write vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.
- **Denial of Service:** The crash itself can lead to a denial of service, disrupting the user's browsing experience.
- **Potential Information Disclosure**: Although not directly specified, a memory corruption vulnerability could also potentially allow an attacker to read data from other processes which have stored data in the GPU.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Pages:**  A malicious actor could craft a webpage with specifically crafted WebGL content that triggers the vulnerability when loaded in a vulnerable browser.
- **Malicious Advertisements**: Malicious code could be injected in a website using an advert.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to host a web page**: An attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious webpage to a victim or inject malicious webgl code into an existing website.
- **Knowledge of WebGL**: The attacker would need an understanding of WebGL to create code that triggers the crash.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was found to affect both NVIDIA and ATI graphics cards on macOS.
- A workaround was implemented by disabling the `glValidateProgram()` function on macOS.
- The fix was applied in Firefox 5 and SeaMonkey 2.2.
- The fix was landed on mozilla-central, aurora, and beta channels.
- The issue was tracked in Bugzilla under bug number 657201.
