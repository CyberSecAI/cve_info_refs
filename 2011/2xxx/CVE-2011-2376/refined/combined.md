firefox security and bug fix update (RHSA-2011-0885)

Original Release Date: July 19, 2011

Last Revised: April 5, 2012

Number: ASA-2011-207

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 2.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the XUL
Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

A flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in Firefox. A web page
containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way Firefox handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
Firefox to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
Firefox. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way Firefox handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause Firefox
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running Firefox.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that Firefox could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL with affected packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya IQ | 4.x, 5.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Message Networking | 5.2 thru 5.2.3 | Low | Upgrade to Message Networking 5.2.4 or later. | | Avaya Messaging Storage Server | 4.0, 5.2 thru 5.2.9 | Low | Upgrade to Messaging Storage Server 5.2.10 or later. | | Avaya Aura® Presence Services | 6.0, 6.1, 6.1.1 | None | Upgrade to Presence Services 6.1.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® Session Manager | 1.1, 5.x, 6.0.x, 6.1.x | None | Upgrade to Session Manager 6.2 or later. See Mitigating Factors table below. | | Avaya Aura® System Manager | 5.x, 6.x | None | See Mitigating Factors table below. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | This is a low risk for Message Networking and Messaging Storage Server as Firefox usage is not standard functionality. There is no risk for IQ, Presence Services, Session Manager and System Manager because Firefox is not installed by default. The xulrunner package is installed and updated per the specific product actions above. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2011-19

## Miscellaneous memory safety hazards (rv:3.0/1.9.2.18)

Announced
June 21, 2011
Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
Critical
Products
Firefox, SeaMonkey, Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Firefox 3.6.18
* Firefox 5
* SeaMonkey 2.2
* Thunderbird 3.1.11

### Description

Mozilla developers identified and fixed several memory safety bugs
in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based
products. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption
under certain circumstances, and we presume that with enough effort at
least some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

### References

Bob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Nils, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman and
Christian Biesinger reported memory safety problems that were fixed in
clients based on mozilla5 and mozilla-1.9.2 (e.g. Firefox 5 and
Firefox 3.6.18 respectively).

Bas Schouten, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, Bill McCloskey, Olli
Pettay, Gary Kwong, Daniel Veditz and Marcia Knous reported memory
safety problems that were fixed in Firefox 5 and SeaMonkey 2.2. These
vulnerabilities did not affect versions prior to Firefox 4 and SeaMonkey 2.1

seamonkey security update (RHSA-2011-0888)

Original Release Date: July 11, 2011

Last Revised: July 11, 2011

Number: ASA-2011-201

Risk Level: Low

Advisory Version: 1.0

Advisory Status: Final

---

## 1. Overview:

SeaMonkey is an open source web browser, email and newsgroup client, IRC
chat client, and HTML editor.

A flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed JPEG images. A
website containing a malicious JPEG image could cause SeaMonkey to crash
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2377](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2377.html) to this issue.

Multiple dangling pointer flaws were found in SeaMonkey. A web page
containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-0083](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0083.html), [CVE-2011-0085](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-0085.html) and [CVE-2011-2363](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2363.html) to these issues.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A web
page containing malicious content could cause SeaMonkey to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the names [CVE-2011-2364](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2364.html), [CVE-2011-2365](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2365.html), [CVE-2011-2374](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2374.html), [CVE-2011-2375](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2375.html) and [CVE-2011-2376](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2376.html) to these issues.

An integer overflow flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled JavaScript
Array objects. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause
SeaMonkey to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user
running SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2371](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2371.html) to this issue.

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way SeaMonkey handled malformed
JavaScript. A website containing malicious JavaScript could cause SeaMonkey
to execute that JavaScript with the privileges of the user running
SeaMonkey. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2373](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2373.html) to this issue.

It was found that SeaMonkey could treat two separate cookies as
interchangeable if both were for the same domain name but one of those
domain names had a trailing "." character. This violates the same-origin
policy and could possibly lead to data being leaked to the wrong domain.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned the name [CVE-2011-2362](https://www.redhat.com/security/data/cve/CVE-2011-2362.html) to this issue.

More information about these vulnerabilities can be found in the security advisory issued by Red Hat:

* <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0888.html>

## 2. Avaya System Products using a modified version of RHEL4 with affected components/packages installed: | Product: | Affected Version(s): | Risk Level: | Actions: | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Avaya Message Networking | 3.1 | Low | Upgrade to MN 5.2 or later. |

**Recommended Actions for System Products:**
Avaya strongly recommends that customers follow
networking and security best practices by implementing
firewalls, ACLs, physical security or other appropriate
access restrictions. Though Avaya believes such
restrictions should always be in place, risk to Avaya
products and the surrounding network from this potential
vulnerability may be mitigated by ensuring these
practices are implemented until such time as an Avaya provided
product update or the recommended Avaya action is applied.
Further restrictions as deemed necessary based on the
customer's security policies may be required during this
interim period, but customers should not modify the System Product
operating system or application unless the change is approved by Avaya.
Making changes that are not approved may void the Avaya product service contract.

### Mitigating Factors:

When determining risk, Avaya takes into account many factors as
outlined by Avaya's
[Security Vulnerability Classification Policy](https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/100066674).
The following table describes factors that mitigate the risk of specific
vulnerabilities for affected Avaya products:

| Vulnerability | Mitigating Factors |
| --- | --- |
| CVE-2011-0083 CVE-2011-0085 CVE-2011-2362 CVE-2011-2363 CVE-2011-2364 CVE-2011-2365 CVE-2011-2371 CVE-2011-2373 CVE-2011-2374 CVE-2011-2375 CVE-2011-2376 CVE-2011-2377 | Low risk as no critical system applications or processes would be affected and would require non-standard user interaction. |

## 3. Avaya Software-Only Products:

Avaya software-only products operate on general-purpose operating systems.
Occasionally vulnerabilities may be discovered in the underlying operating system or
applications that come with the operating system. These vulnerabilities often do not
impact the software-only product directly but may threaten the integrity of the
underlying platform.

In the case of this advisory Avaya software-only products are not affected by the
vulnerability directly but the underlying Linux platform may be. Customers should
determine on which Linux operating system the product was installed and then follow
that vendor's guidance.

| Product: | Actions: |
| --- | --- |
| Avaya Aura® Application Enablement Services 4.x/5.x | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the AES application. |
| CVLAN | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the CVLAN application. |
| Avaya Integrated Management Suite (IMS) | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the IMS application. |
| Avaya Aura® Presence Services | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the PS application. |
| Avaya Aura® System Manager 1.0 | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the SMGR application. |
| Voice Portal | Depending on the Operating System provided by customers, the affected package may be installed on the underlying Operating System supporting the Voice Portal application. |

**Recommended Actions for Software-Only Products:**
In the event that the affected package is installed, Avaya recommends that customers follow recommended actions supplied by Red Hat regarding their Enterprise Linux.

## 4. Additional Information:

Additional information may also be available via the Avaya support
[website](http://support.avaya.com) and through your Avaya
account representative. Please contact your Avaya product support
representative, or dial 1-800-242-2121, with any questions.

2) Solution or Work-Around
There is no known workaround, please install the update packages.
3) Special Instructions and Notes
Please close and restart all running instances of MozillaFirefox after the update.
4) Package Location and Checksums
The preferred method for installing security updates is to use the YaST
"Online Update" module or the "zypper" commandline tool. The package and
patch management stack will detect which updates are required and
automatically perform the necessary steps to verify and install them.
Alternatively, download the update packages for your distribution manually
and verify their integrity by the methods listed in Section 6 of this
announcement. Then install the packages using the command
rpm -Fhv <file.rpm>
to apply the update, replacing <file.rpm> with the filename of the
downloaded RPM package.

6) Authenticity Verification and Additional Information
- Announcement authenticity verification:
SUSE security announcements are published via mailing lists and on Web
sites. The authenticity and integrity of a SUSE security announcement is
guaranteed by a cryptographic signature in each announcement. All SUSE
security announcements are published with a valid signature.
To verify the signature of the announcement, save it as text into a file
and run the command
gpg --verify <file>
replacing <file> with the name of the file where you saved the
announcement. The output for a valid signature looks like:
gpg: Signature made <DATE> using RSA key ID 3D25D3D9
gpg: Good signature from "SuSE Security Team <security@suse.de>"
where <DATE> is replaced by the date the document was signed.
If the security team's key is not contained in your key ring, you can
import it from the first installation CD. To import the key, use the
command
gpg --import gpg-pubkey-3d25d3d9-36e12d04.asc
- Package authenticity verification:
SUSE update packages are available on many mirror FTP servers all over the
world. While this service is considered valuable and important to the free
and open source software community, the authenticity and the integrity of
a package needs to be verified to ensure that it has not been tampered
with.
The internal rpm package signatures provide an easy way to verify the
authenticity of an RPM package. Use the command
rpm -v --checksig <file.rpm>
to verify the signature of the package, replacing <file.rpm> with the
filename of the RPM package downloaded. The package is unmodified if it
contains a valid signature from build@suse.de with the key ID 9C800ACA.
This key is automatically imported into the RPM database (on
RPMv4-based distributions) and the gpg key ring of 'root' during
installation. You can also find it on the first installation CD and at
the end of this announcement.
- SUSE runs two security mailing lists to which any interested party may
subscribe:
opensuse-security@opensuse.org
- General Linux and SUSE security discussion.
All SUSE security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security+subscribe@opensuse.org>.
opensuse-security-announce@opensuse.org
- SUSE's announce-only mailing list.
Only SUSE's security announcements are sent to this list.
To subscribe, send an e-mail to
<opensuse-security-announce+subscribe@opensuse.org>.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=527659&action=edit)

The following was reported to security@m.o by rh01@z1p.biz. There are several crash signatures that were observed, but the worst looking one is the one in this bug's summary:
[bp-f9041a36-322d-498e-b9bb-ef4142110419](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/f9041a36-322d-498e-b9bb-ef4142110419) (caused by testcase2)
There may be more than one bug here. The rest of rh0's email follows:

Hello Brandon,
Thanks for your answer. The modified testcase is in the attachment "testcase2.html". There is even a third distinct crash when starting it.
This testcase led to the following crashes, which are to my opinion 3 distinct ones:

Crash A is maybe the most dangerous one. Though i don't know exactly how to trigger all three differently.
Here are some scenarios i tried:
Load testcase -> switch on firebug -> crash
Switch on firebug -> load testcase -> sometimes a crash -> if no crash occurs => access dom panel -> crash
I think the worst crash (type A) is mostly triggered when starting firefox again after the crash.
Sometimes it loads the tabs automatically which were opened in the last session, which leads to a new crash, as it tries to load the testcase aswell.
This is crash A. (Firebug is automatically switched on in this case)
Can this automatic reopening be set? (except in the general option tab "when firefox starts").
Please keep me informed. For bugzilla I use the address rh01@z1p.biz. As soon as the bug is
filed, can I access it over my account ? Please let me know if you need something else to proceed. I will still look if other similar testcases trigger the crashes more precisely and/or the issue can be triggered without firebug and/or exploited.
Thank you and regards,
Rh0

Attached file
[testcase3](attachment.cgi?id=527662)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=527662&action=edit)

With Firebug installed, the reporter says he can reproduce the js\_TraceScript crash reliably with testcase3, e.g.:
[bp-0eb1e014-319a-4ad1-8f66-6283a2110419](https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/0eb1e014-319a-4ad1-8f66-6283a2110419)

Hello Brandon,
with the following testcase (testcase3.html) I was able to trigger almost always the access execution violation, when trying the following several times
1) Open Firefox
2) double click testcase file (=> firefox loads testcase without crash)
3) click on firebug icon
4) after a period of hanging firebug appears in the bottom half without crashing
5) click anywhere in the firefox or firebug window or on a firebug panel (dom/script)
6) crash
Firebug was set to "On for All Web Pages" and was always in minimized mode.
If Firefox crashes at step 2 or 4 , it is the NULL pointer write attempt, otherwise almost always the access execution violation.
Crash IDs (access execution violation):

In my testing the break condition in the 2nd for loop in testcase3 can be reduced from 16 (n <= 16) to 6 (n <= 6).
Then there is no hanging anymore in step 4, firebug appears immediately in the bottom half.
Then clicking the DOM panel of firebug (step 5) results in a hang period with a crash afterward (at js\_TraceScript)

I tried to reproduce this, and I got it to crash once, with testcase3 I think, but when I tried to make it crash again so I could debug it, I couldn't get it to crash any more.

With testcase3 (modified: [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=651990#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate crash [@ js_TraceScript]")) on WinXP SP3 (~2GB Ram assigned in VirtualBox OSE Version 3 ,Host: Debian 6.0) 8 of 10 crashes are at js\_TraceScript. On native Windows Vista (2GB RAM)I observed "only" JSScope::add crashes (write attempt at 0x0)

On a low hardware netbook (1GB RAM) with native Windows 7 it hangs for minutes but finally crashes (JSScope::add)

On Ubuntu 10.04 on VirtualBox (512MB RAM) i get a SIGKILL signal, no crash reporter comes up.
There's always a crash, after accessing the DOM Panel. If nothing "happens" clicking into the empty firefox window makes firefox unresponsive and ends with a crash.

Thanks for the reply. I was able to repro with the change. I'm fairly sure this particular instance is an OOM crash and not sg:critical. The invalid-exec crashes still concern me a bit. I think they are probably ultimately caused by OOMs as well, so maybe fixing the OOMs will fix those.

To [comment #5](/show_bug.cgi?id=651990#c5 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate crash [@ js_TraceScript]")
I agree that the access violation read and access violation write are maybe not critical. According to <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security_Severity_Ratings> I would consider at least the access execution violation as critical (execution of random memory). There are also fixed bugs, which were critical although they were OOM crashes (e.g.: 608336 , 583077 , 607160 ) So i think an OOM can still be critical. Please correct me if I am wrong.

I agree with you. By "this instance", I meant the exact crash address + access type + source location that I crashed on. But the exec versions are sg:critical.

Notes:
1. Fx4 is confirmed unaffected: it has the OOM check added by the patch.
2. I'm pretty sure there is a bug in Firebug being hit here, so that should probably be reported as well.

I don't see how this patch could possibly fix the EXCEPTION\_ACCESS\_VIOLATION\_EXEC. In the old code where you didn't null-check slots you should immediately crash on the following line
\*slots++ = nslots;
I guess you aren't claiming it does, but then we can't say "Fx4 is confirmed unaffected" based on it having this null check. We can only say Fx4 is not susceptible to the patched crash, which doesn't look like it matches any of the signatures that Rh01 is reporting.

Then there are probably multiple bugs here. The patch for the one I was able to repro, using testcase3.html modified per [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=651990#c2 "RESOLVED FIXED - Investigate crash [@ js_TraceScript]"). It seems likely that we could OOM in various places and fail to detect that, leading to different crash signatures. I will see if I can reproduce the exec violation crash myself.

I can't get any of the test cases to crash with my patch applied. It clearly fixes a bug, so I'd like to land that, then let rh01 test again and see if there's anything left.

To 1.:
There is another issue related to this here, but it affects not only the 1.9.2 but also the 2.0 branch of mozilla firefox, so I filed it as new bug: [bug 654002](/show_bug.cgi?id=654002 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stack overflow with signs of memory corruption (under nsContainerFrame::RemoveFrame)")
To 2.:
I reported this issue also as firebug problem: <http://code.google.com/p/fbug/issues/detail?id=4410>

I just realized i could use the nightly builds. I tested 3.6.18pre:
<http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/latest-mozilla-1.9.2/firefox-3.6.18pre.en-US.win32.installer.exe>
and got to crash it once at all, but at js\_TraceScript:

bc, can you run the crash automation over the test scripts here with both 3.6.17 or before, and also latest 3.6.18 under the following:
1) no firefug
2) firebug installed but not running
3) firebug installed and running
to see if we can get some consistent results.
If there is a consistent crash that's exploitable still we need to stay on this bug or open up new ones.
then we probably need to do the same testing with mozilla-central builds related to [bug 654002](/show_bug.cgi?id=654002 "RESOLVED FIXED - Stack overflow with signs of memory corruption (under nsContainerFrame::RemoveFrame)").
tomcat if you can test by hand that might also help to answer some of these questions.

The crash automation can't handle the str for interacting with firebug unfortunately.

This is verified fixed in 1.9.2.
Using testcase 3 with Firefox 3.6.17 (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.17) Gecko/20110420 Firefox/3.6.17 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)) on XP SP3 with Firebug 1.6.2, I get a crash when selecting the DOM tab (<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/b15793b4-4983-40ad-95c6-2fd512110607>). The same goes for a crash in testcase 3 (<https://crash-stats.mozilla.com/report/index/230b58a7-a341-4fbb-bade-e41572110607>).
With last night's 1.9.2.18pre build, I get neither crash (Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.18pre) Gecko/20110607 Namoroka/3.6.18pre (.NET CLR 3.5.30729)).Keywords: [verified1.9.2](/buglist.cgi?keywords=verified1.9.2&resolution=---)

Attached file
[testcase](attachment.cgi?id=513450)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=513450&action=edit)

Attached testcase crashes both js debug and opt shell on TM changeset 0d4b01278890 without -m nor -j.
Nominating blocking2.0? and setting s-s because I have no idea what this is capable of. It seems to access a weird memory location at 0x1006627d6 in 64-bit.
This also reproduces in 32-bit.

Could be related to [bug 635144](/show_bug.cgi?id=635144 "RESOLVED FIXED - Negative token length when parsing bogus XML code"), which indicates that there are some latent problems with parsing of XML tokens that [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") seems to have exposed.
I won't be able to take a look until Monday morning Melbourne time (2pm Sunday, MV time). Backing out the [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") patch is an option; without the javascript.options.strict flag set the chance of having many error messages on very long lines while a console is attached is not that high.

Thinking some more: let's just back out [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use"). This crash plus the strangeness in 635144 are worrying, and I don't think it's worth the effort and risk right now. The memory spikes we get are at least well understood, they do go back down (assuming your machine hasn't ground to a halt) and this can be fixed in a 4.0.1 release.
Waldo, can you back out the two patches in [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") today? If not, I'll do it on Monday morning Melbourne time.

[Bug 629858](/show_bug.cgi?id=629858 "RESOLVED FIXED - strict warning \"function f does not always return a value\" can cause buffer overreads") also looks related to [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use"). I suspect there may be some latent problems with the lineno/index calculations in the parser, though I may have broken something myself. Let's back [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") out!

Besides [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") and [bug 635144](/show_bug.cgi?id=635144 "RESOLVED FIXED - Negative token length when parsing bogus XML code"), a fragile testcase in [bug 629858](/show_bug.cgi?id=629858 "RESOLVED FIXED - strict warning \"function f does not always return a value\" can cause buffer overreads") may be related. (A small patch in the latter seems to touch lines that the patch in [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") does.)
Just to summarize the plethora of bugs:
Without the patch in [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use"): implications vary from increasing memory usage in [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use"), and / or unreliable crashes in [bug 629858](/show_bug.cgi?id=629858 "RESOLVED FIXED - strict warning \"function f does not always return a value\" can cause buffer overreads").
With the patch: problems in [bug 635144](/show_bug.cgi?id=635144 "RESOLVED FIXED - Negative token length when parsing bogus XML code") and this [bug 635235](/show_bug.cgi?id=635235 "RESOLVED FIXED - Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overreads and possible crashes").

e4x\_TCO++
Stealing the review. I get two Valgrind warnings without the patch, and they disappear with the patch. Thanks, Waldo!

[Bug 629858](/show_bug.cgi?id=629858 "RESOLVED FIXED - strict warning \"function f does not always return a value\" can cause buffer overreads") was present since at least 1.9.1, but the patch in [bug 634444](/show_bug.cgi?id=634444 "RESOLVED FIXED - Long lines with many warnings from javascript.options.strict cause memory spikes when a console or Firebug is in use") exposed it.

[Bug 635144](/show_bug.cgi?id=635144 "RESOLVED FIXED - Negative token length when parsing bogus XML code") is likely a dup of this bug, I'll confirm that later.

Summary: Crash [@ \_\_memcpy] or [@ js::TokenStream::reportCompileErrorNumberVA] → Incorrect line number in e4x tokens leads to buffer overruns and possible crashes

Turns out this isn't a regression. I've confirmed that this code:
eval("try{}catch(e){} <x> </\nx>");
leads to buffer overruns (reported by Valgrind) in both 1.9.1 and 1.9.2. So I've requested that this block 1.9.1 and 1.9.2.
I tracked this bug back, it exists in revision 1 in the hg repository, which means it's at least 4 years old. I didn't track it back further than that, the thought was too depressing because (a) I'd have to deal with CVS, and (b) I'm guessing I'd learn that it's been present since the initial e4x work was done in late 2004.

Yeah, this is an old bug. We have older. In 2004, we didn't have fuzz-testing like we do now, or valgrind in its current state of the art, or more than 11 employees at Mozilla Foundation, or more than the early and uncertain hope of browser competition restarting due to Firefox growing fast since earlier that year, or a functioning Ecma TC39 TG1 (E4X got that body back together, but Microsoft's rep was manager of the C# compiler team, having fun doing paper designs and taking trips -- the IE6 team had been disbanded and only a skeleton crew remained), or a great many other things we now enjoy.
So, cheer up, and no retcons please.
Thanks to Gary and Waldo. Keep going, there are other such bugs hiding from the old days.

Talking to njn, reviewing the details, it looks like this bug is not an sg:critical full remove euid exploit. It's a read-chars-past-end-of-userbuf bug. Privacy loss, not control flow integrity loss or memory overwrite.

I thought I knew what that word meant -- "rewriting history", more or less. Maybe I've got it's meaning wrong, though, because all I did was point out that this is an old bug.

This might only be an overread. In the code at issue here I \*think\* that's all it is. (Even this soon after it's getting a little hazy in my mind.) But I would not be surprised if other locations rely on this information being exactly correct (looks like the position comparison operators do, and they're hard to grep for unfortunately). So I'd still counsel paranoia even if the symptom here looks "not entirely horrible".

Cut the FUD. TokenPos comparison operators are used for def-use fixups in transplanted comprehension expressions. Meanwhile, we have bug bounties going out to real sg:critical reporters. That coin should not be debased by exaggeration here.

Sorry. I'd just thought it was standard practice to err on the side of caution when the extent of a problem was not easily grasped, as I do not (believe I) grasp the extent of the problem here. It's the same approach I've taken lots of other times when asked to assess the security severity of a bug, and that I thought others have taken as well.

lowering to sg:moderate for potentially revealing memory contents, although could be sg:high if you can read arbitrary amounts of memory and get reliable access to it from the script.

Shouldn't it bake on trunk first? Also it's too late for requesting approval for 1.9.1.17 and 1.9.2.14. Those builds are already in beta stage.

This is now our top4 topcrash for Firefox 3.6.16 and happens across all platforms. It started around April 14th and got a high spike yesterday. It's still present in yesterdays nightly build on 3.6 and in our official 3.6.17 beta version. It also affects Firefox 3.5, but 4.0 seems to be unaffected and only shows a high cpu load and memory usage. Crash also happens in a fresh profile.

On mozilla-central the crash has been fixed between 10022405 and 10022503.
Pushlog:
<http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/pushloghtml?fromchange=ddfecbc93934&tochange=a29d44f196a6>
I wonder if this is related to plugins like Flash. I will further investigate.

Completely unrelated to plugins. It's somekind CSS and JS related. The patches on [bug 542592](/show_bug.cgi?id=542592 "RESOLVED FIXED - Change how we use/store nsDocument::mLinkMap") or [bug 461199](/show_bug.cgi?id=461199 "RESOLVED FIXED - Create an API for asynchronous isVisited checks that content/layout can use") could have probably fixed it on mozilla-central.

I think we did some thing in 4.0 to improve in this area, and I'm guessing unless we figure out what changes to backport the only other option would be some site outreach to figure out content work arounds.

Yes, see my [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=650874#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash [@ ExecuteTree]"). One of those changes fixed specifically my case with linuxforums.org. I will check if I can reproduce it on av.by.
I also think that we cannot easily compare 3.6.16 with older branch releases. All of them down to 3.6 are crashing, and most users will now have updated to 3.6.16.

This site is using the exact same method as linuxforums.org:
<style>#eva {background:url(data:,ring.fromC)}</style><script type="text/javascript" src="public.php\_files/acode.js"></script>
Could be part of a framework which has been updated lately which causes this spike on different websites.

Donato Ferrante mailed the security alias about a similar crash with the testcase
<script>
var Fun=eval("eval"); // required
for(u=0; u <3; u++){ Fun(); } // required - it MUST be >= 3
alert("Not bug :("); // extra - can be removed
</script>
like the minimized testcase this has Fun=eval("eval") and a for loop. The fact that it requires at least 3 iterations makes me want to blame TraceMonkey.
The particular signature looks like it crashes at 0x4 which might be safe, depending on where we're getting the null and what else we might get there.

I suspect the problem is gone in Firefox 4 because JaegerMonkey was added and TraceMonkey is used to compile less code than previously.

If we still have TM nightlies from that long ago a fix range on that branch would help.
Confirmed that the code crashes with the JIT turned on (default), doesn't with the JIT turned off.

Thanks (and thank Donato) for the test case. You are correct, this is a crash in tracejit code. The 0x4 comes from here:
037AFE70 mov ecx,dword ptr ds:[4]
AFAIK, the tracejit does not use segment registers. I don't think that much does, and so I don't know much about them. In particular, I don't know if an attacker would be able to control them somehow. If not, then this seems not exploitable.
I'll poke at it a little more to see if I can spot the bug.

|  | |

The "ds:" above seems to be an artifact of the MSVC disassembler. Anyway, the tracejit is definitely trying to generate code that loads from NULL[4], so this should not be exploitable.

Does this still happen on trunk if mjit is disabled? That is, is this really branch-specific, or is it just a matter of heuristics whether we hit it on trunk?

Ooo, good idea. I just tested it on 4.0.1 and it doesn't happen there with mjit disabled, so maybe it has been fixed.

The fix is probably this one:

Not sure if it would land cleanly to 1.9.2 or how much work it would be to rebase.

Ugh, <http://hg.mozilla.org/tracemonkey/rev/e91417e33a53> is exactly the type of patch that you don't want to backport; its rather big and depends on all the scary things that have been in flux since 1.9.2.
By the way, the probable reason the patch appears to fix the bug is that it changes eval from a slow native to a fast native which causes a different codegen path to be taken in the tracer.

Luke: can you think of a less scary way to fix this in 3.6? I don't care if we slow things down by dropping off trace if that's what it takes (within reason, hopefully).

Does that mean the most recent releases might still be vulnerable if we found a different function that was still a slow native? Does the bug even have anything to do with slow natives directly, that is, would there be other ways to send us down the path that leads to bad codegen or is it the "deal with slow natives" code itself that's buggy?Assignee: general → luke

Yeah, disable tracing slow natives. Very low risk. Measuring in the shell, its a 7% SS regression and 2% V8 regression. Seems reasonable to me; I've always wanted to regress SS :)

Nah; I killed slow natives in [bug 581263](/show_bug.cgi?id=581263 "RESOLVED FIXED - remove slow natives").

don't trace slow natives
Approved for 1.9.2.18. Please land this on releases/mozilla-1.9.2 default. If you are so inclined, you can land this on releases/mozilla-1.9.1 as well for 3rd parties maintaining the old branch.
Also, can you confirm that Firefox 5 is unaffected?

Attached patch

[(maybe) fix actual problem](attachment.cgi?id=532761&action=diff)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=532761&action=edit)
— [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=650874&attachment=532761)

Based on the patch that fixed the crash, I guessed the cause was something to do with slow natives + indirect eval, but I hadn't actually done a full triage to confirm this. To give a confident answer to Christian's questions, I looked at the generated code and indeed the bug is not with slow natives; the problem is that JSOP\_CALLGVAR and record\_JSOP\_CALLGVAR do different things for 'this'. Calling a slow native ('eval' being the most common) just touches 'this' in a way to crash, but I can also get an (always NULL) crash from:
function f() {}
function g() { this.f(); }
var h = g;
for (var i = 0; i < 8; ++i)
h();
The obvious fix (attached) fixes this case and the one in [comment 20](/show_bug.cgi?id=650874#c20 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash [@ ExecuteTree]"). Both testcases crash on 1.9.1 and the patch (unmodified) fixes both. I'm fairly confident this is the right fix, but this area has all sorts of subtleties and I didn't write it so I'd appreciate careful consideration by the reviewers.

Oh, and to actually answer [comment 42](/show_bug.cgi?id=650874#c42 "RESOLVED FIXED - crash [@ ExecuteTree]"): this-passing logic was rewritten (again) for FF4 and for all the JSOP\_CALL\* cases I can see 'this' handling in the tracer matches the interpreter (although its a bit hairy so second opinions welcome).

(maybe) fix actual problem
I can't shed any additional light on the original source of this bug, but given what jsops.cpp does for JSOP\_CALLGVAR, I think this is definitely correct.

## Details

Multiple memory vulnerabilities were discovered in the browser rendering

engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with

the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2364](/security/CVE-2011-2364), [CVE-2011-2365](/security/CVE-2011-2365),

[CVE-2011-2374](/security/CVE-2011-2374), [CVE-2011-2376](/security/CVE-2011-2376))

Martin Barbella discovered that under certain conditions, viewing a XUL

document while JavaScript was disabled caused deleted memory to be

accessed. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or

execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2373](/security/CVE-2011-2373))

Jordi Chancel discovered a vulnerability on multipart/x-mixed-replace

images due to memory corruption. An attacker could potentially use this to

crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user

invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2377](/security/CVE-2011-2377))

Chris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow vulnerability

in JavaScript Arrays. An attacker could potentially use this to execute

arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

([CVE-2011-2371](/security/CVE-2011-2371))

Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered. An attacker could

potentially use these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the

user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0083](/security/CVE-2011-0083), [CVE-2011-0085](/security/CVE-2011-0085), [CVE-2011-2363](/security/CVE-2011-2363))

David Chan discovered that cookies did not honor same-origin conventions.

This could potentially lead to cookie data being leaked to a third party.

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape
package only provides the XPCOM code.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-6.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-3.

We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.
