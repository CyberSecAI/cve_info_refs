Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2479:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from inconsistent handling of Transparent Huge Pages (THP) in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem, specifically when using `mmap()` with the `MAP_PRIVATE` flag on `/dev/zero`. 

*   The `huge_memory.c` THP page fault handler was allowed to run if `vma->vm_ops` was NULL. This condition was met by `/dev/zero MAP_PRIVATE` mappings because the file's `mmap` operation doesn't set up special `vm_ops`, causing it to fall back to regular anonymous memory handling.
*   However, other THP logic checks for a non-NULL `vma->vm_file` (which is set for `/dev/zero`), and these checks were not fully activated, resulting in a condition where a file-backed `vma` with THP enabled was not being handled correctly.
* The code allowed THP on a file-backed vma without proper handling of `vm_file`, leading to issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent THP Handling:** The core issue was the inconsistent application of checks for THP on `/dev/zero` mappings. Specifically, the page fault handler checked `vm_ops` while other parts of the THP logic checked `vm_file`, leading to a bypass.
*   **Incorrect Page Fault Handling**: The page fault handler allowed THP to be enabled on `/dev/zero` mappings when it shouldn't have been.
*   **Missing Robustness Checks:** The code didn't have sufficient checks to prevent THP from being enabled in such situations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An unprivileged local user could exploit this vulnerability to trigger a kernel panic, resulting in a system crash. The vulnerability was triggered when `madvise` was used on top of the `/dev/zero` mapping, with the potential to cause a panic due to the inconsistent handling.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector requires local access to the system, as the user needs to make the system calls `mmap()` and `mprotect()` to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Unprivileged User:** An unprivileged local user can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the target system.
*   **Ability to make system calls:**  The attacker needs to be able to call the  `mmap()` and `mprotect()` system calls.
*   **No special privileges needed:**  The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability; it can be done by a local user with limited rights.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when THP is enabled with the "always" option, the user touches pages within a mapped region, and then tries to protect it with `mprotect(PROT_NONE)`.
*   The fix involves removing the `vm_file` checks, ensuring that `/dev/zero` can safely use THP, and adding a check for `VM_NO_THP`.
*   A test program was provided to reproduce the issue.
