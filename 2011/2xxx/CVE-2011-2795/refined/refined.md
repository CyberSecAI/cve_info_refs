The provided content includes a blog post announcing the release of Chrome 13, which lists several security fixes, including CVE-2011-2795.

Based on the information provided:

*   **Vulnerability:** CVE-2011-2795: Cross-frame function leak.
*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is described as a "cross-frame function leak", implying that functions intended to be confined within a frame are being exposed to other frames.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** This vulnerability is a leak of functions across frame boundaries. This may violate the principle of least privilege and allow unintended access to functionality.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is not specified in detail. However, a function leak across frames could lead to a variety of security issues depending on the nature of the leaked functions. It could allow an attacker to execute code, gain access to sensitive information, or circumvent security restrictions of a different frame, leading to potential compromise of data or functionality within other frames.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves cross-frame communication, where an attacker can exploit the leak via malicious or compromised content in a different frame.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject content within a frame that is able to interact with a vulnerable frame in order to trigger the function leak. The injected content likely has to be able to communicate across frames, such as through Javascript.

The information given here provides more detail than the CVE description, by specifying the type of vulnerability as a cross-frame function leak, the fact it involves functions, and giving some details of exploitation.
