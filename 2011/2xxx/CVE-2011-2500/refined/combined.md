# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

According to Neil Brown:

    The point of the word 'reliable' is to check that the name we get
    really does belong to the host in question - ie that both the
    forward and reverse maps agree.

    But the new code doesn't do that check at all.  Rather it simply
    maps the address to a name, then discards the address and maps the
    name back to a list of addresses and uses that list of addresses as
    "where the request came from" for permission checking.

This bug is exploitable via the following scenario and could allow an
attacker access to data that they shouldn't be able to access.

    Suppose you export a filesystem to some subnet or FQDN and also to a
    wildcard or netgroup, and I know the details of this (maybe
    showmount -e tells me) Suppose further that I can get IP packets to
    your server..

    Then I create a reverse mapping for my ipaddress to a domain that I
    own, say "black.hat.org", and a forward mapping from that domain to
    my IP address, and one of your IP addresses.

    Then I try to mount your filesystem.  The IP address gets correctly
    mapped to "black.hat.org" and then mapped to both my IP address and
    your IP address.

    Then you search through all of your exports and find that one of the
    addresses: yours - is allowed to access the filesystem.

    So you create an export based on the addrinfo you have which allows
    my IP address the same access as your IP address.

Fix this by instead using the forward lookup of the hostname just to
verify that the original address is in the list. Then do a numeric
lookup using the address and stick the hostname in the ai_canonname.

## Topic

Updated nfs-utils packages that fix two security issues, various bugs, and
add one enhancement are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

The nfs-utils packages provide a daemon for the kernel Network File System
(NFS) server, and related tools such as the mount.nfs, umount.nfs, and
showmount programs.

A flaw was found in the way nfs-utils performed IP based authentication of
mount requests. In configurations where a directory was exported to a group
of systems using a DNS wildcard or NIS (Network Information Service)
netgroup, an attacker could possibly gain access to other directories
exported to a specific host or subnet, bypassing intended access
restrictions. (CVE-2011-2500)

It was found that the mount.nfs tool did not handle certain errors
correctly when updating the mtab (mounted file systems table) file. A local
attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file. (CVE-2011-1749)

This update also fixes several bugs and adds an enhancement. Documentation
for these bug fixes and the enhancement will be available shortly from the
Technical Notes document, linked to in the References section.

Users of nfs-utils are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to resolve these issues and add this
enhancement. After installing this update, the nfs service will be
restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=720479#c0)  bcodding    2011-07-11 18:56:09 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  Building nfs-utils-1.2.3 from nfs-utils-1.2.3-7.el6.src results in a non-functional svcgssd due to incorrect library order at link time.  Libgssapi_krb5 duplicates symbols in libgssglue, but svcgssd fails to function properly when running through libgssapi_krb5.  This is due to libtool looking up dependencies in libtirpc.la, of which lgssglue is one, and moving them to the end of the list.  Libtool is designed to do this, and contains notes explaining that behavior.  Configured with ./configure  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  libtirpc-devel-0.2.1-3.el6.x86_64 libtool-2.2.6-15.5.el6.x86_64  Steps to Reproduce:  [root@kudu1 gssd]# make /bin/sh ../../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=link gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wstrict-prototypes  -pipe -g -O2  -I/usr/include/gssglue    -g -O2   -o svcgssd svcgssd-context.o svcgssd-context_mit.o svcgssd-context_heimdal.o svcgssd-context_lucid.o svcgssd-context_spkm3.o svcgssd-gss_util.o svcgssd-gss_oids.o svcgssd-err_util.o svcgssd-svcgssd.o svcgssd-svcgssd_main_loop.o svcgssd-svcgssd_mech2file.o svcgssd-svcgssd_proc.o ../../support/nfs/libnfs.a  -lgssglue -ldl   -lnfsidmap -lgssapi_krb5 -lkrb5 -lk5crypto -lcom_err -ltirpc  libtool: link: warning: library `/lib64/libtirpc.la' was moved. libtool: link: warning: library `/lib64/libtirpc.la' was moved. libtool: link: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Wstrict-prototypes -pipe -g -O2 -I/usr/include/gssglue -g -O2 -o svcgssd svcgssd-context.o svcgssd-context_mit.o svcgssd-context_heimdal.o svcgssd-context_lucid.o svcgssd-context_spkm3.o svcgssd-gss_util.o svcgssd-gss_oids.o svcgssd-err_util.o svcgssd-svcgssd.o svcgssd-svcgssd_main_loop.o svcgssd-svcgssd_mech2file.o svcgssd-svcgssd_proc.o  ../../support/nfs/libnfs.a /usr/lib64/libnfsidmap.so -lgssapi_krb5 -lkrb5 -lk5crypto -lcom_err /lib64/libtirpc.so -lnsl -lgssglue -ldl -lpthread   Actual results:  svcgssd[15145]: DEBUG: serialize_krb5_ctx: lucid version! svcgssd[15145]: ERROR: GSS-API: error in gss_export_lucid_sec_context(): GSS_S_NO_CONTEXT (No context has been established) - (0x00007fff) svcgssd[15145]: ERROR: failed serializing krb5 context for kernel svcgssd[15145]: WARNING: handle_nullreq: serialize_context_for_kernel failed   Expected results:  svcgssd[15820]: DEBUG: serialize_krb5_ctx: lucid version! svcgssd[15820]: prepare_krb5_rfc4121_buffer: protocol 0 svcgssd[15820]: prepare_krb5_rfc4121_buffer: serializing key with enctype 6 and size 24 svcgssd[15820]: doing downcall   Additional info:  A quick fix is to specify lgssglue as a linker option, which libtool ignores:  GSSGLUE_CFLAGS="-Wl,-lgssglue" ./configure   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=720479#c2)  Orion Poplawski    2011-08-09 20:31:31 UTC  ``` Same problem here.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:44:36 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way nfs-utils performed authentication of an incoming request, when an IP based authentication mechanism was used and certain file systems were exported to either to a netgroup or a wildcard (e.g. *.my.domain), and some file systems (either the same or different to the first set) were exported to specific hosts, IP addresses, or a subnet. A remote attacker, able to create global DNS entries could use this flaw to access above listed, exported file systems.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=701702> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/27/7>     (CVE Request)  Relevant upstream patch: [3] <http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=130875695821953&w=2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:46:17 UTC  ``` Further details how to reproduce the issue (from [1]): ======================================================  1/ On a server, export a filesystem to an IP address and a random wildcard. e.g.  /export 192.168.1.1(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check) *.mydomain.com(ro,no-subtree_check)  exportfs -av  2/ In /etc/hosts define some name to have two IP address; one that was given in    /etc/exports, one that is the IP address of your attach client    192.168.1.1 attacker   192.168.0.1 attacker  3/ try to mount /export from 192.168.0.1  This should normally fail, but the bug causes it to succeed.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:47:41 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the nfs-utils package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  --  This issue affects the versions of the nfs-utils package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the nfs-utils package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:48:29 UTC  ``` Created nfs-utils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 716950](show_bug.cgi?id=716950 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2500 nfs-utils: Improper authentication of an incoming request when an IP based authentication used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-29 08:51:55 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-2500](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2500) has been assigned to this issue: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/28/17>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-06-30 09:40:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of nfs-utils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact; a future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 18:53:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1534 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1534.html>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:44:36 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way nfs-utils performed authentication of an incoming request, when an IP based authentication mechanism was used and certain file systems were exported to either to a netgroup or a wildcard (e.g. *.my.domain), and some file systems (either the same or different to the first set) were exported to specific hosts, IP addresses, or a subnet. A remote attacker, able to create global DNS entries could use this flaw to access above listed, exported file systems.  References: [1] <https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=701702> [2] <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/27/7>     (CVE Request)  Relevant upstream patch: [3] <http://marc.info/?l=linux-nfs&m=130875695821953&w=2>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:46:17 UTC  ``` Further details how to reproduce the issue (from [1]): ======================================================  1/ On a server, export a filesystem to an IP address and a random wildcard. e.g.  /export 192.168.1.1(rw,no_root_squash,no_subtree_check) *.mydomain.com(ro,no-subtree_check)  exportfs -av  2/ In /etc/hosts define some name to have two IP address; one that was given in    /etc/exports, one that is the IP address of your attach client    192.168.1.1 attacker   192.168.0.1 attacker  3/ try to mount /export from 192.168.0.1  This should normally fail, but the bug causes it to succeed.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c2)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:47:41 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the versions of the nfs-utils package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5.  --  This issue affects the versions of the nfs-utils package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the nfs-utils package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15. Please schedule an update.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c3)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-27 14:48:29 UTC  ``` Created nfs-utils tracking bugs for this issue  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 716950](show_bug.cgi?id=716950 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2011-2500 nfs-utils: Improper authentication of an incoming request when an IP based authentication used [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c4)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-29 08:51:55 UTC  ``` The CVE identifier of [CVE-2011-2500](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2500) has been assigned to this issue: <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2011/06/28/17>   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c8)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-06-30 09:40:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of nfs-utils as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5. The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact; a future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=716949#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2011-12-06 18:53:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6  Via RHSA-2011:1534 <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1534.html>   ``` |  |
