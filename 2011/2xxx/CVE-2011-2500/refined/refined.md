{
  "Root cause": "The `host_reliable_addrinfo` function in nfs-utils incorrectly handled reverse and forward DNS lookups when authenticating mount requests. Instead of verifying that the original IP address was present in the forward lookup of the hostname obtained from the reverse lookup, the function used the potentially attacker-controlled forward lookup addresses for access control checks.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Improper authentication",
    "Incorrect handling of DNS lookups"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker could bypass intended access restrictions and potentially gain unauthorized access to NFS exported file systems. This is achieved by manipulating DNS records to include the victim server's IP in the forward lookup of a hostname they control.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Remote network attack",
    "DNS spoofing/manipulation"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send IP packets to the target NFS server. The attacker must also control DNS records (either through direct access or by using an existing, trusted, but vulnerable DNS server) and create a reverse mapping of their IP address to a domain they control. They also need to know how the target server's exports are configured (which can be obtained via showmount -e)."
