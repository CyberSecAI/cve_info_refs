Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2678:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions assigned to the Cisco VPN Service executable (`cvpnd.exe`) during installation on 64-bit Windows systems.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure File Permissions:** The default permissions for `cvpnd.exe` allow unprivileged, interactive users to replace the executable. Specifically, the `NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE` group has write access.
- **Service Execution with Elevated Privileges:** The Cisco VPN Service runs with `LocalSystem` privileges, meaning that any program executed through the service runs with the highest level of system privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Local Privilege Escalation:** An unprivileged user can replace the legitimate `cvpnd.exe` with a malicious executable. When the Cisco VPN service starts or restarts, the malicious executable runs with `LocalSystem` privileges, giving the attacker full control over the system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** Attackers achieve full control of the system (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts are all complete)
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary code with `LocalSystem` privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable Cisco VPN client is installed.
- **File Replacement:** The attacker leverages the write permissions on `cvpnd.exe` to replace it with their malicious file.
- **Service Restart:** The attacker can trigger a service restart, or wait for a service restart, to execute their malicious file via the service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to log on to the affected system.
- **Basic File Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to replace a file on disk.
- **No special privileges:** The user needs no special privileges to execute this attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by NGS Secure Research.
- The issue is a reoccurrence of a similar vulnerability found in 2007 in the same product.
- The fix involves revoking the write access from the `NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE` group on the `cvpnd.exe` file. This can be done using the `cacls` command.
- Cisco released a fix for this vulnerability.

This analysis provides more detail than the basic CVE description, which only notes that it is a "privilege escalation vulnerability" with no root cause explanation.
