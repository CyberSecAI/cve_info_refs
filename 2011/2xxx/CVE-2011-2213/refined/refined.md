Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation within the `inet_diag_bc_audit()` function in the Linux kernel's `inet_diag` module. This function is responsible for auditing bytecode used in network diagnostics.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Infinite Loop:** A malicious user or a buggy application could inject specially crafted bytecode that would cause the `inet_diag_bc_audit()` function to enter an infinite loop. This is due to the lack of proper validation of jump instructions and their offsets within the bytecode. Specifically, an `INET_DIAG_BC_JMP` opcode with a "yes" value of 0 would cause this.
- **Unaligned Accesses (Indirectly):** The code also mentions that instructions were not guaranteed to be aligned on 4-byte boundaries. While not a direct security vulnerability itself, it could potentially lead to faults on some architectures and should be avoided. The patch includes alignment fixes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit of this vulnerability results in a denial of service. The infinite loop within `inet_diag_bc_audit()` would consume system resources, preventing normal operation of the affected system. The description mentions "a local, unprivileged user to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)".

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Exploitation:** The primary attack vector is local. A malicious or buggy application running on the target system could exploit the flaw.
- **Bytecode Injection:** The attacker must craft and inject malicious bytecode into the system, targeting the `inet_diag_bc_audit()` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system, even an unprivileged one, to be able to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Interact with `inet_diag`:** The attacker must be able to interact with the `inet_diag` interface, likely through the netlink socket, to provide the malicious bytecode.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity by Red Hat.
- This issue was reported by Dan Rosenberg.
- The fix for this vulnerability includes validation checks in the code, particularly to ensure that jump instructions have valid offset and prevent the infinite loop condition. The fix also enforces proper alignment.
- Red Hat provided fixes for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 was determined to be out of scope for the fix.
- The fix was backported into older kernels.
- The vulnerability is present in the Linux Kernel, specifically the `inet_diag` module.
- The vulnerability was fixed in upstream kernel version eeb1497277d6b1a0a34ed36b97e18f2bd7d6de0d.
