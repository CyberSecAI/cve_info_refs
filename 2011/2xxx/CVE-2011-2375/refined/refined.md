**General Description:** CVE-2011-2375 encompasses a set of memory safety issues identified and fixed in Firefox 5 and SeaMonkey 2.2, but did not affect earlier versions. These issues could lead to crashes or potentially allow arbitrary code execution.

**Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Bug 648705:**
        *   **Root Cause:**  Dangling pointers in WebGL shader handling within `mozilla::WebGLProgram::DetachShaders()`. Specifically, the `mAttachedShaders` vector was storing raw pointers to shaders, which could become invalid if a shader was deleted via `WebGLContext::DeleteShader()`.
        *   **Weakness:** Use of raw pointers instead of smart pointers in managing shader attachments.
        *   **Impact:**  Crash due to invalid memory access when detaching shaders, potentially exploitable.
        *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious website could trigger the vulnerability by deleting a shader and then trying to use the program.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to execute WebGL code within the browser, manipulating shader objects via JavaScript.

    *   **Bug 643927:**
        *   **Root Cause:** Garbage collection (GC) hazard in `JS_XDRScriptObject` related to script filename serialization. The `JSScript::filename` was only rooted by `JSScript`, leading to a situation where it could be collected if not also rooted elsewhere in XDR code.
        *   **Weakness:** Incorrect lifetime management of filename string during serialization process and a race condition with GC
        *   **Impact:**  Potential for a crash during garbage collection.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering specific JavaScript actions that cause the garbage collector to run at the wrong moment during script deserialization.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to execute JavaScript, and have enough control to induce a GC.

    *   **Bug 654015:**
        *   **Root Cause:** Assertion failure related to requesting a refresh driver after a document has disconnected in SMIL code. Specifically, a document could be detached without a corresponding `OnPageHide` call, causing issues when the `nsSMILAnimationController` tried to use it's `mDocument`.
        *   **Weakness:** Incorrect handling of document lifecycle in SMIL animation code.
        *    **Impact:**  Assertion failure, potentially leading to exploitable state.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating SVG documents and history through JavaScript to trigger specific load/unload sequences.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to create a webpage with SVG and JavaScript.

    *   **Bug 653238:**
        *   **Root Cause:** The `nsSMILAnimationController::mDocument` member, a raw pointer, was not cleared when the document was destroyed, leading to potential use-after-free issues.
        *   **Weakness:** Use of raw pointer and lack of lifecycle management for the document pointer.
        *   **Impact:**  Potential crash if the `mDocument` pointer is accessed after being freed.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a scenario where an animation controller outlives its associated document, through specific actions with SMIL.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to create a webpage with SVG/SMIL.

    *   **Bug 653026:**
        *   **Root Cause:** GC hazard due to unrooted method objects created in js_OnUnknownMethod. These methods were not handled properly by the GC, leading to crashes.
        *   **Weakness:** Insufficient management of a method object with no shape during garbage collection.
        *   **Impact:**  Crashes related to garbage collection issues.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting JS NoSuchMethod handler in javascript to cause GC to trigger.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to execute JavaScript code.

    *   **Bug 652401:**
        *   **Root Cause:**  Lack of proper JS context management when calling `mozRequestAnimationFrame` callbacks. The JS context was not pushed onto the stack before executing these callbacks.
        *  **Weakness:** Lack of appropriate context management with `mozRequestAnimationFrame` callbacks.
        *   **Impact:**  Potentially unexpected behavior/crash due to the incorrect context.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing JavaScript to create and manage `mozRequestAnimationFrame` callbacks.
        *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to execute JavaScript using `mozRequestAnimationFrame` callbacks.

    *   **Bug 643839:**
        *   **Root Cause:**  A logic error in `js::gc::MarkChildren` when defining setters, resulting in an overwritten slot not being cleared correctly, leading to a stale pointer to a collected object.
        *   **Weakness:** The code failed to clear the slot before reusing it.
        *   **Impact:**  Crash due to using freed memory during garbage collection.
        *   **Attack Vector:** Utilizing setters in javascript with a specific series of actions which induces a GC after overwriting a slot.
        *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to execute javascript including the usage of defineSetter and GC.

    *   **Bug 597162:**
         *   **Root Cause:**  Privileged chrome pages loaded in content docshells. Non-chrome web content could get a reference to a privileged chrome window through `window.top`, and be able to execute functions on it, potentially achieving arbitrary code execution.
         *   **Weakness:** Exposing chrome windows with content type and exposing functions.
         *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution through exploitation of exposed chrome functions.
         *  **Attack Vector:**  Web content can get reference to a chrome window using the top property.
         *   **Required Capabilities:** Requires an attacker to inject their code into a content frame which is within a chrome frame. Requires ability to control navigation.
     *    **Bug 648022:**
          *   **Root Cause:**  Incorrect handling of script filenames during serialization and deserialization using XDR.  Specifically, `JSScript::filename` is only rooted by `JSScript` causing it to be garbage collected at the wrong time.
          *  **Weakness:** Missing root of filename variable during script clone.
          *   **Impact:** Crash due to a garbage collected filename variable.
          *  **Attack Vector:** Creating JS scripts, and then cloning or serializing / deserializing it in a way which induces the garbage collector at the wrong time.
          *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to craft Javascript to create clone scripts.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to:

*   **Crashes:** Denial of service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Remote code execution with the privileges of the user running Firefox, allowing a remote attacker to take control of the system.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Although less common among these issues, one vulnerability (`CVE-2011-2362`) involved cookie leakage and thus potentially exposing private user data.

**4. Attack Vectors and Required Capabilities:**

The vulnerabilities are primarily exploitable through:
*   Malicious web pages containing crafted HTML, JavaScript, and SVG/SMIL.
*   Specific JS operations triggering the garbage collector at certain times.
*   Manipulation of WebGL.
*    Specific sequences of JavaScript operations using nested windows, navigation, and calls to browser API (like window.open)
*   A combination of the above, triggering use after free, use before free, and GC issues within the browser.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would generally need to be able to host a malicious website or inject code into a legitimate website.
*   Knowledge of the specific JavaScript APIs and browser behaviors is required to successfully exploit the vulnerabilities.
*    In some cases, the ability to execute code or inject Javascript in a chrome privileged environment or a website in a frame in the chrome context.

**6. Additional Notes:**

*   The content provides more detail than the basic CVE description, especially regarding the specific code locations and mechanisms of each vulnerability.
*   The bugzilla entries document the fixes, workarounds and mitigations put in place by the Mozilla developers for each specific vulnerability.
*   The Mandriva, and Red Hat content primarily confirms that there was a security update addressing this CVE, but doesn't provide much technical detail on the vulnerability.
*   The Avaya content indicates that Avaya products may be affected indirectly, depending on the OS they are running.

In conclusion, CVE-2011-2375 is a collection of memory safety issues in Firefox and SeaMonkey stemming from various root causes. Exploitation could range from causing crashes to potentially arbitrary code execution.
