Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2003:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a buffer overrun in the Windows kernel-mode driver (win32k.sys) when handling specially crafted .fon font files. Specifically, the driver fails to properly validate the size of the buffer before writing to memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The core issue is that the driver does not allocate the correct buffer size when processing font files. This leads to memory being overwritten and allowing an attacker to overwrite kernel memory.
- Input validation failure: The Windows kernel-mode driver does not properly validate the size of the input passed from user mode.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode. This grants the attacker full control over the system.
- Full system compromise: Attackers can then install programs, view, change, or delete data, and create new accounts with full administrative rights.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network attack: An attacker places a malicious .fon file on a network share (including WebDAV or UNC path). Then, they trick a user into accessing it. When the user opens the file using Windows Explorer, the vulnerability is triggered.
- Email attack: An attacker sends the malicious .fon file as an email attachment. If the user opens the attachment, the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted .fon font file that can trigger the buffer overflow.
- In a network-based attack, the attacker needs to place the file on a network share accessible to the target user.
- In an email-based attack, the attacker needs to send the malicious file as an attachment and persuade the victim to open it.
- No user authentication is required for the attack, but some user interaction (opening the malicious file) is necessary.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in the win32k.sys driver, which is part of the Windows subsystem and manages window displays, screen output, and graphics.
- The advisory notes that the file sharing protocol SMB is often disabled on perimeter firewalls, which limits remote attack vectors.
- Disabling the WebClient service can mitigate the WebDAV attack vector by preventing WebDAV requests.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Important" in terms of its severity.
- This vulnerability was privately reported to Microsoft.
