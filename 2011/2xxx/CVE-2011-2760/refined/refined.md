Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2011-2760 (though not explicitly stated in the provided content, the vulnerability discussed is related to CVE-2011-4884, which the provided content maps to this issue. Since the official CVE description is a placeholder, this can be accepted as contextually relevant).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Brocade BigIron RX switch improperly handles packets with source port 179 (BGP). The switch prioritizes internal ACL rules for BGP traffic, which are processed before user-defined ACLs. This effectively bypasses user-configured ACLs intended to block or restrict BGP traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **ACL Bypass:** User-defined Access Control Lists (ACLs) are bypassed due to the priority given to internal ACLs, making user-configured rules ineffective.
*   **Improper Prioritization:** The switch prioritizes internal ACLs over user-defined ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **ACL Bypass:** An attacker can bypass any ACL rule configured on the Brocade BigIron RX switch.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** This can allow unauthorized access to services like SSH and RDP, even if ACLs are configured to restrict such access.
*   **Network compromise:** Allows unauthorized access to the network behind the switch.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Traffic Manipulation:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending packets with source port 179.
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the BigIron RX switch.
*   **Packet Forging:** Ability to send network traffic with a specified source port (179).
*   **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this issue.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Bashar Ewaida.
*   Brocade assigned software defect 355173 to this issue and released patches.
*   The internal ACLs are located in the CAM before user ACLs.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in RX 2.8.00a, 2.7.03b, and 2.7.02l releases.
*  The US-CERT vulnerability note identifier is VU#853246.
*  The vulnerability was first published on 2011-07-13.
