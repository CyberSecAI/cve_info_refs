Please use CVE-2011-2187.

This deserves an ID as the error probably won't happen until a few minutes

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c0)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 13:47:26 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Latest xscreensaver exits when activated leaving screens unlocked, big security risk if one doesn't notice it and relies on it to lock the screen  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-devel-2.6.35.12-90.fc14 both i686 and x86_64  How reproducible: Every single time  Steps to Reproduce: 1. start xscreensaver 2. activate with xscreensaver-command -lock    Actual results: xscreensaver exits with error message (or similar): xscreensaver: <timestamp>: X Error! PLEASE REPORT THIS BUG. xscreensaver: <timestapm>: screen 0/0: 0xfa, 0x0, 0x1e00001  ###########################################################  X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)   Major opcode of failed request:  132 (DPMS)   Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (DPMSForceLevel)   ....  Expected results: screen locked  Additional info: Previous version worked fine   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c1)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 13:50:04 UTC  ``` Sorry cut & pasted version from VNC didn't work! Actual version-release number is:   xscreensaver-5.13-1.fc14 both i686 and x86_64   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c2)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-10 14:10:04 UTC  ``` Does not seem to be reproducible with me (although I am using F-15). Would you do the following? Thank you.  - Attach /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if any), and /var/log/Xorg.0.log - Attach ~/.xscreensaver - Once kill xscreensaver with   $ xscreensaver-command -exit   , and attach the output of   $ xscreensaver -debug   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c3)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-10 14:25:52 UTC  ``` Maybe $ xscreensaver -sync -verbose -debug is more useful.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c4)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 14:35:19 UTC  ``` Tried that (or maybe -log ... instead of -debug), same result, no core. Need to look into core limit settings but can't do it till later. Reverting a few machines ...   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c5)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-10 14:41:19 UTC  ``` For this issue, dumping core needs "-sync" option.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c6)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-10 15:21:38 UTC  ``` Easily reproducible with - MODE: Blank screen only - "Power Management Enabled": unchecked - and execute $ xscreensaver-command -act  :(   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c7)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 15:39:54 UTC  ``` Yes, those are my settings, guess I don't need to check further. Reverted to, and works fine with xscreensaver-5.12-14.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c8)  Fedora Update System    2011-05-10 17:12:55 UTC  ``` xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc15 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 15. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc15>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c9)  Fedora Update System    2011-05-10 17:13:11 UTC  ``` xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc14 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 14. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc14>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c10)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 17:30:32 UTC  ``` x86_64 works, will try i686 in a moment, but this set of rpms has the same problem that xscreensaver-5.12-14.fc14.x86_64 had, i.e. yum complains:   Package xscreensaver-gl-base-5.13-2.fc14.x86_64.rpm is not signed and requires a --nogpgcheck to be installed.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c11)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 17:42:53 UTC  ``` i686 also works, xscreensaver-gl-base is also not signed   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c12)  Fedora Update System    2011-05-10 21:17:03 UTC  ``` Package xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc14: * should fix your issue, * was pushed to the Fedora 14 testing repository, * should be available at your local mirror within two days. Update it with: # su -c 'yum update --enablerepo=updates-testing xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc14' as soon as you are able to. Please go to the following url: <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc14> then log in and leave karma (feedback).   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c13)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-11 00:58:28 UTC  ``` I guess now all these new rpms (except for ones for rawhide) are signed (packages are to be signed just before they are pushed into testing or stable repository).  However thank you for quick confirmation.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c14)  Fedora Update System    2011-05-13 23:13:12 UTC  ``` xscreensaver-5.13-2.fc14 has been pushed to the Fedora 14 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c15)  Fedora Update System    2011-05-16 03:28:21 UTC  ``` xscreensaver-5.13-3.fc15 has been submitted as an update for Fedora 15. <https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/xscreensaver-5.13-3.fc15>   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c16)  Fedora Update System    2011-05-25 02:24:36 UTC  ``` xscreensaver-5.13-3.fc15 has been pushed to the Fedora 15 stable repository.  If problems still persist, please make note of it in this bug report.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c17)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-06-03 17:03:48 UTC  ``` This issue did NOT affect the version of the xscreensaver package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.  --  This issue did NOT affect the version of the xscreensaver package, as present within EPEL-6 repository.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c18)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2011-06-07 06:12:21 UTC  ``` This has been assigned [CVE-2011-2187](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2011-2187) via: [http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/5186/focus=5209](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.oss.general/5186/focus%3D5209)   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c19)  Huzaifa S.

Subject: xscreensaver: Fails to lock screen
Date: Fri, 20 May 2011 11:14:54 +0200
```
Package: xscreensaver
Version: 5.13-1
Severity: grave
Tags: security
Justification: user security hole

Hello,

Steps to reproduce:

    1) launch xscreensaver
    2) launch "xscreensaver-command -lock" in another terminal.
    3) The screen starts to turn blank, but returns to normal again
       immediately after turning fully blank.

At this point xscreensaver has exited with the following message:

    ##############################################################################

    xscreensaver: 11:05:19: X Error!  PLEASE REPORT THIS BUG.
    xscreensaver: 11:05:19: screen 0/0: 0xaf, 0x0, 0x1a00001

    ##############################################################################

    X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
      Major opcode of failed request:  131 (DPMS)
      Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (DPMSForceLevel)
      Serial number of failed request:  655
      Current serial number in output stream:  656

    #######################################################################

	If at all possible, please re-run xscreensaver with the command
	line arguments `-sync -verbose -log log.txt', and reproduce this
	bug.  That will cause xscreensaver to dump a `core' file to the
	current directory.  Please include the stack trace from that core
	file in your bug report.  *DO NOT* mail the core file itself!  That
	won't work.  A "log.txt" file will also be written.  Please *do*
	include the complete "log.txt" file with your bug report.

	<http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html> explains how to create
	the most useful bug reports, and how to examine core files.

	The more information you can provide, the better.  But please
	report this bug, regardless!

    #######################################################################

When I try to reproduce the problem with "xscreensaver -sync -verbose -log log.txt",
the screensaver does not exit but is stuck at 100% CPU and not
responding.

It seems they have the same problem in Fedora:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c0)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 13:47:26 UTC  ``` Description of problem: Latest xscreensaver exits when activated leaving screens unlocked, big security risk if one doesn't notice it and relies on it to lock the screen  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): kernel-devel-2.6.35.12-90.fc14 both i686 and x86_64  How reproducible: Every single time  Steps to Reproduce: 1. start xscreensaver 2. activate with xscreensaver-command -lock    Actual results: xscreensaver exits with error message (or similar): xscreensaver: <timestamp>: X Error! PLEASE REPORT THIS BUG. xscreensaver: <timestapm>: screen 0/0: 0xfa, 0x0, 0x1e00001  ###########################################################  X Error of failed request: BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)   Major opcode of failed request:  132 (DPMS)   Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (DPMSForceLevel)   ....  Expected results: screen locked  Additional info: Previous version worked fine   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c1)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 13:50:04 UTC  ``` Sorry cut & pasted version from VNC didn't work! Actual version-release number is:   xscreensaver-5.13-1.fc14 both i686 and x86_64   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c2)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-10 14:10:04 UTC  ``` Does not seem to be reproducible with me (although I am using F-15). Would you do the following? Thank you.  - Attach /etc/X11/xorg.conf (if any), and /var/log/Xorg.0.log - Attach ~/.xscreensaver - Once kill xscreensaver with   $ xscreensaver-command -exit   , and attach the output of   $ xscreensaver -debug   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c3)  Mamoru TASAKA    2011-05-10 14:25:52 UTC  ``` Maybe $ xscreensaver -sync -verbose -debug is more useful.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=703483#c4)  Henrique Martins    2011-05-10 14:35:19 UTC  ``` Tried that (or maybe -log ... instead of -debug), same result, no core.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

Justification: user security hole

Hello,

Steps to reproduce:

    1) launch xscreensaver
    2) launch "xscreensaver-command -lock" in another terminal.
    3) The screen starts to turn blank, but returns to normal again
       immediately after turning fully blank.

At this point xscreensaver has exited with the following message:

    ##############################################################################

    xscreensaver: 11:05:19: X Error!  PLEASE REPORT THIS BUG.
    xscreensaver: 11:05:19: screen 0/0: 0xaf, 0x0, 0x1a00001

    ##############################################################################

    X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
      Major opcode of failed request:  131 (DPMS)
      Minor opcode of failed request:  6 (DPMSForceLevel)
      Serial number of failed request:  655
      Current serial number in output stream:  656

    #######################################################################

	If at all possible, please re-run xscreensaver with the command
	line arguments `-sync -verbose -log log.txt', and reproduce this
	bug.  That will cause xscreensaver to dump a `core' file to the
	current directory.  Please include the stack trace from that core
	file in your bug report.  *DO NOT* mail the core file itself!  That
	won't work.  A "log.txt" file will also be written.  Please *do*
	include the complete "log.txt" file with your bug report.

	<http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/bugs.html> explains how to create
	the most useful bug reports, and how to examine core files.

	The more information you can provide, the better.  But please
	report this bug, regardless!

    #######################################################################

When I try to reproduce the problem with "xscreensaver -sync -verbose -log log.txt",
the screensaver does not exit but is stuck at 100% CPU and not
responding.

It seems they have the same problem in Fedora:

(10.4.0 or newer) * API change: instead of providing a single screenhack() function that   does not return, screen savers using the screenhack.h framework must   now provide *“init”* and *“draw one frame”* functions instead. All   bundled savers have been updated; third-party patches will need   work. * All image-loading happens asynchronously. * xscreensaver-getimage-file caches the contents of the image   directory for a few hours, so consecutive runs won't have to re-list   the whole directory tree. * New hacks, **topblock** and **glschool**. * Removed **xteevee** (superceded by **xanalogtv**). * Added variable-sized puzzle pieces to **jigsaw**. * Changes to the defaults and command-line options of many hacks to   make the .xml files more consistent. * Reap zombies in **glslideshow** and **carousel**. * **sonar** works without setuid on macOS (dgram icmp). * **xmatrix -mode pipe** displays the text of a subprocess. * **endgame** has higher resolution chess-piece models. * **webcollage** takes a **-directory** option to get images from a local   directory. * The RPM spec file no longer auto-restarts xscreensaver when a new   version is installed. Restart it manually. | |
| 4.24 | 08-Feb-2006 |
| * New versions of **cube21**, **glsnake**, **celtic**. * Backed out a DPMS-related patch that cause desktop flickering with   some X servers. * Fixed startup crash in getgroups() when running setuid. * Default to not displaying stderr on the saver window. * Fixed bad free() in *“Documentation”* button. * Don't try to run hacks that aren't installed. * Minor fixes to various XML config files and man pages. | |
| 4.23 | 21-Oct-2005 |
| * New hacks, **glhanoi**, **cube21**, **timetunnel**, **juggler3d**, and   **celtic**. * New versions of **tangram**, **webcollage**, **hypertorus**, **polytopes**,   and **ripples**. * **sonar** is now quiet about unresolvable hosts. * Minor corrections to BASIC code in **apple2**. * xscreensaver-demo now provides an RPM clue when none of the hacks   seem to be installed. * Don't install **ant** by default, since there is some Java tool of   that name, which was causing confusion. And also it's boring. * Made screen grabbing work again on macOS 10.4.2. * No longer prints bogus warnings about ClientMessages intended for   the window manager. * Ignore unprintable characters in passwd entry field. * Fixed yet another cross-host-display image-loading endian problem. * **xscreensaver-command -watch** and **-time** now work on 64-bit   machines. | |
| 4.22 | 22-Jun-2005 |
| * Fixed a bug in the new mouse-motion code that caused the screen to   never blank on multi-head non-Xinerama systems. Oops. * New hacks, **interaggregate**, **antmaze**, **tangram**, and **crackberg**. * Minor tweaks to **fiberlamp**, **ifs**, **slidescreen**, **zoom**, **sonar**,   **fireworkx**, **whirlwindwarp**, **bubble3d**, and **rd-bomb**. * Added motion blur to **blinkbox**. * **bsod** now includes Longhorn's *“RSOD”*, and OS/2. * Fixed **-wireframe** usage in most hacks and man pages. | |
| 4.21 | 20-Mar-2005 |
| * New hack: **fliptext**. * Changed default configure installation directories: /usr/bin/ for   xscreensaver, etc.; /usr/libexec/xscreensaver/ for hacks;   /usr/share/xscreensaver/config/ for xml files. * All the text-manipulating screen savers can have their text source   configured via **xscreensaver-demo** now. * xscreensaver.spec now builds three RPMs: base (no hacks); extras (2d   hacks); and gl-extras. * Added **-program** and **-front** option to **gltext**. * Added **-shells** to **molecule**. * Fixed text-alpha glitch in **carousel**. * New **pacman**: the ghosts can be killed now. * Fixed a bug in screen-grabbing GL hacks where images would be tiled   instead of scaled on machines that can't do large textures. * **webcollage** can hit Flickr now. * New (rewritten) implementation of **ifs**. * The unlock dialog can be made to have a *“New Login”* button that will   run **gdmflexiserver**. Experimental! * Fixed non-ASCII display bug in **starwars**. * Configure finds a default for imageDirectory. * **xscreensaver-command -lock** now works even if in *“screensaver   disabled”* mode. * If a bad password is typed while CapsLock is on, the unlock dialog   says *“CapsLock?”* instead of *“Sorry”*. * Mouse motion only counts as activity if the mouse moved more than 10   pixels (so the screen won't unblank every time you bump your desk.) * New mode option *“random-same”*: if you have multiple monitors, this   will run the *same* randomly chosen hack on each screen, instead of   different ones on each. | |
| 4.20 | 23-Feb-2005 |
| * New hacks, **fiberlamp**, **boing**, **boxfit**, and **carousel**. * Rewrote **glslideshow** again: should be faster now. * Sped up loading of images in GL programs. * **starwars** uses texture-mapped fonts now. * New **bsod** modes: tru64, hppa, and nvidia. * Updates to **webcollage**, **juggle**, **pinion**, **fireworkx**, **sonar**,   **extrusion**, **substrate**, and **pong**. | |
| 4.19 | 16-Dec-2004 |
| * New hacks, **substrate**, **intermomentary**, **fireworkx**, and **pinion**. * New version of **flow**. * Made /proc/interrupts work again on Linux 2.6. * Made **analogtv** not hog the CPU. * Made analogtv-based hacks work properly on PPC/ARM. * Fixed a bad memory leak in **piecewise**. * Minor updates to **sonar**, **molecule**, **glmatrix**, **galaxy**, and   **webcollage**. * Removed support for GTK 1.x (everyone uses 2.x now.) | |
| 4.18 | 14-Aug-2004 |
| * Oops, pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. | |
| 4.17 | 14-Aug-2004 |
| * New hacks, **anemotaxis** and **memscroller**. * Fixed a bad bug that caused **vidwhacker** to never die. * Fixed normals and lighting in **polyhedra**. * Don't reuse the window when changing hacks (to work around bugs in   some GL implementations.) * Made **xscreensaver-getimage-file** skip thumbnail-sized images. * Fixed endian problem in **barcode** on non-x86. * Updates to **webcollage**, **apple2**, **fuzzyflakes**, **atunnel**, and   **pacman**. * Timing tweaks to **bubble3d**, **bouncingcow**, **engine**, **gltext**,   **lavalite**, **molecule**, **spotlight**, **sballs**, **boxed**, **blinkbox**,   and **circuit**. * Configure updates for Fedora core 2 / xorg 6.7.0. * Compile without warnings under gcc 3.3.3. * I give up: don't blank or lock the screen if we can't get a keyboard   grab. In that case, both choices are bad. | |
| 4.16 | 12-May-2004 |
| * New hacks, **polyhedra**, **fuzzyflakes**, **antinspect**, and   **providence**. * Minor updates to **webcollage**, **bsod**, **endgame**, **antspotlight**,   **xmatrix**, and **glmatrix**. * Added support for the RANDR (Resize and Rotate) extension to detect   when the size of the desktop has been changed while xscreensaver is   already running. * Possibly-futile attempt to work around *“rdesktop”* focus/grab idiocy. * Made **xscreensaver-getimage -file** still work even if imageDirectory   is unset. * Convert Latin1 to ASCII in **starwars** and **phosphor** (since the GLUT   font only has ASCII glyphs.) * Fixed randomization in **noof**. * Added *“GetViewPortIsFullOfLies”* preference to work around   longstanding XFree86 bug #421. * Made **sonar** subnet pinging work properly on bigendian machines   (e.g., PPC.) | |
| 4.15 | 26-Feb-2004 |
| * New hacks, **wormhole**, **mismunch**, **noof**, and **pacman**. * **phosphor** and **apple2** include vt100 emulators now: this means you   can do *“phosphor **-program** top”*, or can use either program as an   xterm replacement: *“apple2 **-text** **-fast** **-program** 'xemacs **-nw**”*'. * **analogtv** (and related) fill the screen better. * The '-gradient' option works in **atlantis** now. * Minor updates to **blinkbox**, **queens**, **endgame**, **glmatrix**,   **mirrorblob**, **blocktube**, and **molecule**. * Integrated SuSE's *“external passwd helper”* support. * Marginally better /tmp handling in various programs. * Updated config defaults for xplanet 1.0.3. * Portability fixes. | |
| 4.14 | 25-Oct-2003 |
| * New hacks, **fontglide**, **apple2**, **xanalogtv**, **pong**,   **gleidescope**, **mirrorblob**, and **blinkbox**. * New version of **glsnake** (with many more models.) * Another Windows crash in **bsod**; also HVX/GCOS6/TPS6. * New version of **endgame**. * Screen grabbing works on macOS. * Various minor fixes. | |
| 4.13 | 07-Sep-2003 |
| * On Xinerama systems, xscreensaver now runs one hack on each monitor   (just like in *“real”* multi-head mode) instead of running one hack   stretching across all the screens. Note that for this to work with   any 3rd party screensavers, they must update their *“vroot.h”* file. * **webcollage** and **vidwhacker** display images using   **xscreensaver-getimage** now. * Added **ljlatest** script for use with **starwars** and **phosphor**. | |
| 4.12 | 14-Aug-2003 |
| * New GL hacks, **flipflop**, **antspotlight**, and **polytopes**. * Added VMS to **bsod**. * Compile without warnings in **gcc -pedantic**. * Updates to **webcollage** and **queens**. * Fixed a bug that could cause PAM to hang. | |
| 4.11 | 23-Jun-2003 |
| * New hacks, **hypertorus**, **cubestorm**, **glknots**, **blocktube**, and   **glmatrix**. * Updates to **cloudlife**, **engine**, **xmatrix**, and **sonar**. * Rewrote **glslideshow**: it should work on somewhat wimpier video   cards now. * Various portability tweaks. | |
| 4.10 | 20-May-2003 |
| * New hacks, **cloudlife** and **klein**. * Added Apple ][+, HPUX, and OS/390 sessions to **bsod**. * Added some Matrix Reloaded text to **xmatrix**. * Updates to **webcollage**, **eruption**, **jigglypuff**, **metaballs**, and   **endgame**. * Completely ignore the **memoryLimit** setting now, since it was still   causing people GL grief. * Various minor fixes. | |
| 4.09 | 17-Mar-2003 |
| * New hacks, **flyingtoasters**, **bouncingcow**, **jigglypuff**, and   **glslideshow**. * More models in **engine**. * Rewrote **xscreensaver-getimage** to remove reliance on external image   loaders (xv, chbg, xloadimage, etc.) and to reduce flicker when   loading files. * Made **gflux** and **flipscreen3d** be mouse-spinnable. | |
| 4.08 | 18-Feb-2003 |
| * New hacks, **atunnels** and **piecewise**. * Physics improvement in **fluidballs**. * Various fixes for XDarwin systems (X11 on macOS.) * Added **-clock** option to **barcode**. * Minor fixes to **endgame**, **flurry**, **flipscreen3d**, and **gflux**. | |
| 4.07 | 03-Feb-2003 |
| * New hacks, **flurry**, **metaballs**, **eruption**, **popsquares**, and   **barcode**. * Minor updates to **maze** for high density mazes. * Added double buffering to **fluidballs** and **whirlygig**. * Bug fixes for running xscreensaver to a remote XFree86 display   (which nobody would ever do...) * Updated **webcollage** (faster Alta Vista searching.) * Updated **glplanet** so the sun sets in the west. * Updated **sproingies** with smooth, unsegmented surfaces. * Fixed Perl version-sensitivity in **xscreensaver-getimage-file**. * Fixed GTK2 scrolling bug in **xscreensaver-demo**. | |
| 4.06 | 23-Oct-2002 |
| * New hack, **glblur** (disabled by default, since it requires fast   OpenGL texture support.) * New hack, **halftone**. * Updates to **endgame**, **queens**, **bumps**, **glplanet**, **engine**, and   **circuit**. * New version of **menger** that uses far fewer polygons. * Fixed minor bug in **critical** that could cause some bogus X servers   to crash. * Better labels in **molecule**: the labels now appear to be attached to   the atoms, instead of floating in front of the whole scene. * Fixed bug that could rarely cause GL hacks to fail to double-buffer   (causing intermittent flickering.) * Fixed a relative-URL-parsing bug in **webcollage**. * Fixed a bug that (sometimes) caused the window manager close box to   kill **xscreensaver-demo** with a crash instead of a graceful exit. * Updated xscreensaver.pam to the Red Hat 7.3 way. * More Gnome2-related configure crap. * Updated to latest **config.guess** and **config.sub**. * Fixed occasional core dump in **distort**. * Added a Linux fsck failure and kernel panic to **bsod**. * Added macOS kernel panic to **bsod**. * Fixed a bug in **bsod** (all bsod bugs are ironic.) * Fixed a bug that caused **xscreensaver-gl-helper** to print a nonsense   visual ID with some versions of **printf**: this could cause GL   programs to display incorrectly (e.g., flickery.) | |
| 4.05 | 11-Jun-2002 |
| * More **configure** tweaks to try and get things working on systems   that both Gtk 1.x and 2.x installed. * New hack, **endgame**. * Minor updates to **gltext**. | |
| 4.04 | 31-May-2002 |
| * Support for GTK 2.x / GNOME 2.x. * The **configure** script will now use **pkg-config** if you have it, in   preference to **gtk-config**, etc. * New hacks, **lavalite**, **queens**, and **anemone**. * Minor updates to **spheremonics**, **gltext**, **xmatrix**. * You can use the mouse to manually spin most of the GL hacks now   (when they are displaying in a window.) * Fixed a bug in **webcollage** (due to recent Alta Vista url changes)   that was causing it to try and load incorrect image URLs. * Made **xscreensaver-getimage** use gdk\_pixbuf if it is available: this   means that those hacks that load images will no longer rely on **xv**,   **xloadimage**, etc. This will close a race condition that could   sometimes cause your desktop background to be changed; and also   makes it possible for those programs to operate on image files when   running in windowed mode. * **webcollage** can now be used in conjunction with **driftnet** to   display images snooped from your local ethernet instead of obtained   from search engines. * Added man pages for all the hacks that didn't have them. | |
| 4.03 | 11-May-2002 |
| * New hack, **spheremonics**. * Minor updates to **webcollage**, **cage**, **moebius**, **morph3d**,   **boxed**, **circuit**, and **helix**. * **pulsar** and **extrusion** can now load texture JPEGs. * **rubik** now does non-square cubes. * **fluidballs** now does various sizes of balls. * **menger** and **sierpinski3d** now also show polygon counts in **-fps**   mode. * **molecule** displays real subscripts in the formulae. * GTK internationalization/localization support. * Better detection of the various versions of libxml. * Upgraded to autoconf 2.53 (from 2.13.) | |
| 4.02 | 18-Mar-2002 |
| * Plugged a few minor leaks in **xscreensaver** and **xscreensaver-demo**. * New hacks, **cubenetic** and **fluidballs**. * Sped up **pipes**. * Fixed sphere projection error in **glplanet**; installed a better   image of earth. * Added Win2K and MacOS 1 crashes to **bsod**. * Put back previous (better) version of **forest** that was   accidentially downgraded in the last release. * New version of **bumps**. * Made FPS computation in GL hacks more efficient: it will influence   the results less, thus resulting in higher (but more accurate)   reported frame rates. | |
| 4.01 | 24-Feb-2002 |
| * New hacks: **twang**, **glsnake**, **boxed**, **sballs**, and   **glforestfire**. * New hacks **apollonian**, **euler2d**, **juggle**, **polyominoes** and   **thornbird**, from xlockmore. * Merged recent xlockmore changes into **ant**, **braid**, **demon**,   **discrete**, **drift**, **fadeplot**, **forest**, **grav**, **hopalong**,   **ifs**, **laser**, **lightning**, **lisa**, **lissie**, **loop**, **mountain**,   **penrose**, **rotor**, **sierpinski**, **slip**, **sphere**, **spiral**,   **strange**, and **vines**. * Fixed the **gltext** bug that sometimes caused horizontal lines to   vanish again. This time for sure. * Sped up **webcollage** by adding a C helper program to replace the PPM   pipeline. It also pastes images semi-transparently now. * Added support for the gdk\_pixbuf library: if this lib is available,   then **blitspin**, **xflame**, and **flag** can load GIF, JPEG, and PNG   images in addition to XPM and XBM. * Fixed a rare race condition where the desktop-grabbing hacks could   sometimes leave the screen wedged, if the user moved the mouse   exactly when they were grabbing the screen image (it would un-wedge   the next time the saver timed out or was activated.) * Fixed incorrect colors in the screen-grabbing GL hacks (**gflux** and   **flipscreen3d**.) * Made SIGHUP restart the daemon process (though using   **xscreensaver-command -restart** is still the preferred way.) * Tweaks to **xspirograph**. * Minor configure and portability tweaks. | |
| 4.00 | 02-Jan-2002 |
| * Redesigned **xscreensaver-demo** GUI: it now includes small-preview   and per-hack configuration dialogs. * Added three new modes of operation: **One Screen Saver**, **Blank   Screen**, and **Don't Blank** (in addition to the historical **Random   Screen Saver**). * Configure now defaults to installing the hacks in   <prefix>/lib/xscreensaver/ instead of <prefix>/bin/. (Most distros   already did it this way.) * New GL hacks, **menger**, **engine**, **flipscreen3d**. * Made **sierpinski3d** be more colorful. * New versions of **xmatrix** and **nerverot**. * Fixed a bug in **starwars** that made the font be drawn with thin   lines in **-root** mode. * Fixed a bad colormap bug in **crystal** that could make *subsequent*   hacks malfunction! * Made **gflux** able to grab screen images (**-mode grab**). * Updated **webcollage** for recent search engine changes. * Removed most command-line options to **xscreensaver**: just edit the   ~/.xscreensaver file instead. * Improved behavior on multi-screen and Xinerama systems: the mouse   now stays on the screen where the user left it, and the password and   splash dialogs always appear on the screen that has the mouse. * Made the splash dialog use more Gtk-like colors; made it have only   two buttons, *“Settings”* and *“Help”*. * Made **sonar** understand **.ssh/known\_hosts2** format files, and be   better about stripping out illegal addresses. | |
| 3.34 | 25-Oct-2001 |
| * Turned **memoryLimit** off by default, sigh. Apparently some versions   of the GL libraries (appear to) allocate hundreds of megs for every   GL program, so **memoryLimit** was causing GL programs to malfunction   or crash on those systems. * Improved fading on TrueColor XFree86 4.1.x systems. * New GL hack, **circuit**. * Added **fuzz** mode to **decayscreen**. * New version of **whirlygig**. * Added links to **xplanet** and **sphereEversion**. * Fixed rare race condition that could make **sonar** hang. * Fixed potential crash in **speedmine**. * Made **xscreensaver-demo** not crash when imageDirectory was set to a   non-existent directory. * Made **xscreensaver-getimage-video** invoke XawTV's **streamer** program   better. * Made **phosphor** and **starwars** deal with CR, LF, or CRLF line   endings. * Changes for Cygwin compilation environments. * Made **sonar** compile on systems that can't ping. * Configure changes for HPUX 10.20. * Made PAM code work on Red Had 4.2 systems. * Made **xscreensaver-command -deactivate** work when the saver is not   active: what that does is reset the idle timer, as if keyboard input   had been detected. This was added for the benefit of people writing   DVD-playing software: they can now prevent the screensaver from   kicking in by sending a **-deactivate** message once a minute while the   movie is playing and not paused. * Various minor portability tweaks. | |
| 3.33 | 03-Jun-2001 |
| * New hacks, **speedmine** and **whirlygig**. * Sped up **pyro**, made the explosions look a bit better. * Added better stars to **glplanet** and **starwars**. * Many internal changes to **webcollage**. * Some new options to **attraction**. * Minor fix to **noseguy** to avoid un-erased pixels. * Rewrote the screen-eraser effects so that they complete in the same   amount of time regardless of how slow your X server is (some of them   were glacial on servers with slow blitting.) * Fixed a potential free memory reference that could sometimes cause a   crash at startup. * Possibly fixed a problem that could cause the daemon to crash with   an X error. I was never able to reproduce this problem, but I think   I might have figured out what caused it. * Worked around a problem that caused PAM authentication to fail on   some Red Hat 7.x systems. * Added a **memoryLimit** parameter that controls the amount of memory a   graphics hack may allocate: if they try to allocate more than this,   malloc() will fail (and they will exit or (safely) crash, rather   than hogging memory.) Default is 50M. * Made **gnome-help-browser** be the default way to display man pages in   **xscreensaver-demo**, if running on a GNOME system. | |
| 3.32 | 16-Apr-2001 |
| * The image-manipulating hacks (**slidescreen**, etc.) can now operate   on randomly chosen image files from disk, or on frames captured from   the system's video input, instead of (or in addition to)   manipulating images of the desktop. * Rewrote **vidwhacker** to use the new image-grabbing mechanism. * Made fading work on TrueColor XFree86 4.x systems. * Fixed a subtle rendering bug in **atlantis** (the fish were inside   out!) * Made **atlantis** have a texture simulating light reflections from the   surface of the ocean. * Fixed up label placement in **molecule**. * Better color bars in **xteevee**. * Made **install-strip** not try to strip scripts. | |
| 3.31 | 29-Mar-2001 |
| * Put in more sensible defaults for DPMS, and updated the   documentation to reflect the fact that all your DPMS settings are   now belong to xscreensaver. * Fixed the **xscreensaver.spec** file so that **--force** is no longer   needed. * New versions of **rotzoomer** and **nerverot**. * Fixed an OSF/1 compilation problem in **molecule**. | |
| 3.30 | 19-Mar-2001 |
| * New hacks, **molecule**, **dangerball**, and **rotzoomer**. * New version of **gflux**. * Made **gltext** able to display the current time. * Fixed a floating-point-precision problem in **gltext** that sometimes   caused horizontal lines to vanish. * Removed the **-window-id** option from the hacks: it never worked   right, and was unnecessary. * Made the **starwars** hack use thicker lines, antialias the text, and   fade out at the far edge instead of just dropping off. * Fixed an SHM segment leak in **moire**. | |
| 3.29 | 13-Feb-2001 |
| * Better rendering of the new logo. * New hack, **gltext**. * Added **-planetary** option to **gears**, to draw a different kind of   gear system. * Made motion and rotation be smoother in **gears**, **glplanet**,   **moebius**, **rubik**, and **sierpinski3d**. * Improved coloration in **sierpinski3d**. * Made the GL hacks react to window size changes. * Made most of the GL hacks take a **-fps** option (like **pulsar** did), so   you can use them to benchmark your 3D hardware. * Fixed the previous fix to **sonar**. * Minor fix to **nerverot**. Made sonar able to ping hosts on DEC OSF1. * Eliminated a bogus *“didn't get enough colors”* warning in some of the   hacks. | |
| 3.28 | 02-Feb-2001 |
| * New logo for xscreensaver! * New hacks, **starwars** and **stonerview**. * Made the motion of the bouncing ball in **stairs** be a little less   jerky. * Made newly-added screenhacks be added to .xscreensaver   automatically: if there are hacks in the app-defaults file that are   not also in ~/.xscreensaver, they will be added to the end of the   list. * Redid the **Screensaver Options** part of the control panel;   xscreensaver now lets you configure your DPMS settings. * Fixed some Makefile problems with non-GL builds. * Fixed detection of MesaGL for version 3.3. * Better workaround to Red Hat 7.0's broken gcc. * Added Sparc Solaris kernel panic to **bsod**. | |
| 3.27 | 19-Jan-2001 |
| * New hacks: **zoom** and **whirlwindwarp**. * Fixed a free-memory-reference bug in **sonar**. * Better error handling when there are no suitable GL visuals. * Added diagnostic dialog when xscreensaver-demo is unable to launch   xscreensaver (e.g., when running as root.) * Fixed a bug that caused screenhack argument changes to be ignored   when xscreensaver-demo was running as root (if *“root”* and *“nobody”*   have different home directories.) * Made the programs default to *“:0”* if $DISPLAY is unset. * Made the **-verbose** output include information about which server   extensions were supported at compile time. * Worked around Red Hat 7.0's broken gcc 2.96. * Updated default delays on the GL hacks to look better on machines   with super-fast 3D hardware. * Install **screensaver-properties-capplet** to work around the usual   egregious GNOME lossage. | |
| 3.26 | 10-Nov-2000 |
| * Added *“enabled”* checkboxes in the list of hacks in xscreensaver-demo   (Gtk version only.) * New hacks **hyperball**, **xrayswarm**, and **gflux**. * New versions of **nerverot**, **galaxy**, and **hypercube**. * Small fixes to **phosphor**, **shadebobs**, **xflame**, and **sonar**. * Added external helper program **xscreensaver-gl-helper** to figure out   which X visual to use for OpenGL programs. * Configure updates for XFree86 4.0, and for BSD. * Made it be more tolerant of bogus /etc/group files. * When installing the PAM config file, first try to just copy an   existing *“xdm”* or *“login”* config file, so that xscreensaver does   authentication in the same way as the rest of the system. | |
| 3.25 | 19-Jul-2000 |
| * New hack, **nerverot**. * Added BSD kernel panic to **bsod**. * New version of **shadebobs**. * New version of **petri**. * Updated **webcollage** to handle recent Altavista URL format changes;   made it search the AP photo gallery. * Revamped command-line options of **sonar** and made it properly handle   subnets. * The **bubbles** hack can now trickle up or down the screen. * The **xsublim** hack can now read its text from programs. * Support for GLE version 3 in **extrusion**. * Fixed compilation problems in **maze**. * Fixed a rare crash in **flow**. * Fixes for minor installation problems. | |
| 3.24 | 03-Apr-2000 |
| * Added **-ignorant** option to **maze** hack. * Updates to **critical**, **bsod**, **xflame**, and **flow**. * Added support for Kerberos 5 (via its Kerberos 4 compatibility   layer.) * Fixed a bad leak in **xteevee**. * Updated **webcollage** to handle recent Altavista URL format changes. * Removed xscreensaver-demo's **Ok** and **Cancel** buttons, since they   were confusing people: all changes are now instantanious. * Made xscreensaver-demo install itself into the Gnome Control Center. | |
| 3.23 | 30-Jan-2000 |
| * Fixed some misplaced text fields in the Motif version of   xscreensaver-demo; fixed a crash in the Gtk version that would   happen if the programs list was empty. * Fixed a recently-introduced bug in **pulsar**. * Made **sierpinski3d** use solid tetrahedrons instead of points. * Added **-trace** option to **xmatrix**. * Added new hacks **xteevee** and **xspirograph**. | |
| 3.22 | 09-Dec-1999 |
| * Fixed some bugs in xscreensaver-demo. * Rewrote the Motif version of xscreensaver-demo to match the new Gtk   version. * The Athena toolkit is no longer supported. | |
| 3.21 | 18-Nov-1999 |
| * Tweaked the xscreensaver-demo UI (Gtk only.) * Fixed a few visual selection bugs. I think the proper GL visual   should be used with nVidia systems now. * Made the Makefiles obey $install\_prefix. * Made the **xscreensaver.spec** file able to generate both GL and   non-GL packages simultaneously. | |
| 3.20 | 12-Nov-1999 |
| * Added new hacks **ripples** and **sierpinski3d**. * Made **xscreensaver-command -exit** be silent when no screen saver was   running (instead of complaining.) * Made **webcollage** and **vidwhacker** use **xloadimage** when available   (in addition to **xli** and **xv**.) * Improved memory usage in **petri** and gave it a hard cap on how much   memory it can allocate. * Added **-watch** option to **xscreensaver-command**. * Made **xscreensaver-demo** come up with the most-recently-run hack   selected by default. * Rewrote the Gtk version of **xscreensaver-demo**. It's a lot easier   to use now. * Extended the format of the programs list in the .xscreensaver file,   for the benefit of the new capabilities of **xscreensaver-demo**.   NOTE: you might want to delete your ~/.xscreensaver file and allow   it to be re-created! The old one should still work, but   xscreensaver-demo won't be as pretty. | |
| 3.19 | 30-Oct-1999 |
| * Fixed gcc dependencies in **bumps** and **ccurve**. * New hack, **extrusion**. * Some of the web sites that **webcollage** was using as its sources   changed formats; tweaked it to understand the current layouts. * Added typeahead in the password dialog: if the screen is locked, and   you unlock it by typing a character, that key will be automatically   inserted in the password dialog (unless it is Return, Enter, Space,   or a non-printing key like Shift.) * Made **xmatrix** take a **-small** option, since some folks with tiny   screens prefer a smaller font. | |
| 3.18 | 13-Oct-1999 |
| * New versions of **shadebobs**, **lmorph**, and **distort**. * Added **ccurve**, **blaster**, and **bumps** hacks. * Replaced **forest** hack with a rewritten version. * Worked around a Xinerama server bug. * Fixed a bug I introduced in 3.10 that caused some hacks to print out   superfluous warnings about not having gotten enough colors. * Made **sproingies** obey the **-delay** option. * Fixed a portability bug in **shadebobs**. * Made **webcollage** and **vidwhacker** use **xli** in preference to **xv**,   if it is available. * Added a new source of images to **webcollage**. * If running under KDE, xscreensaver will add itself to KDE's list of   screensavers (via xscreensaver.kss.) * Improved detection of GL libraries. * Made the password dialog include the date and time. | |
| 3.17 | 15-Jul-1999 |
| * New version of **webcollage** -- deals better with corrupted images,   and can use an http proxy. * New hack, **xsublim** (run it in the background, rather than adding it   to the programs list.) * The xscreensaver daemon was leaking a file descriptor each time you   edited your .xscreensaver file. Fixed. | |
| 3.16 | 23-Jun-1999 |
| * New version of **shadebobs**. * Improved image selection in **webcollage**, and sped it up slightly. * Made configure find the right version of perl. * Rewrote the CGI part of **webcollage**. * **make clean** was deleting some things it shouldn't. * Fixed a typo in the default programs list. | |
| 3.15 | 20-Jun-1999 |
| * Added **webcollage** and **shadebobs** hacks. * Added a **-stdout** arg to **vidwhacker** so that it can be used in a   pipeline. * Made **petri** use less memory. | |
| 3.14 | 11-Jun-1999 |
| * Various improvements to the Gtk port. * Turned off PAM by default on Solaris, since PAM seems generally to   be misconfigured out-of-the-box. * Made the **--without-gtk** configure option work. * Made configure check the Gtk version number, since it requires 1.2. * Fixed a bug in the code that attempted to prevent changes of screen   resolution while the screen is locked. * Fixed a race condition in **xscreensaver-demo** that could cause an X   error at startup. * Added **-transparent** option to **deluxe**. * Added **petri** hack. | |
| 3.13 | 31-May-1999 |
| * Ported **xscreensaver-demo** to Gtk. * Made it possible to build Motif, Gtk, and Athena versions of   **xscreensaver-demo** in the same directory without reconfiguring. * Made **xscreensaver-demo** chase symlinks before writing the   .xscreensaver file, so that if .xscreensaver is itself a symlink,   the underlying file will be replaced instead. * Some Makefile and configure tweaks for Solaris and FreeBSD. * Made it possible to set the fire color in **xflame**. * Made transparency work in TrueColor (for **goop** and **qix**.) * Fixed a multi-head bug introduced by the virtual viewports stuff. | |
| 3.12 | 10-May-1999 |
| * Made it so that you can't scroll the screen while the lock dialog is   up (with XFree86 virtual viewports.) * Fixed a bug in **flag** that caused bob's chin to get cut off after a   few iterations. | |
| 3.11 | 07-May-1999 |
| * Made **xjack** be black-on-white-ish, so that it looks less like a   computer screen and more like the typewritten paper it's supposed to   be. * New version of **pulsar**. * Fixed Solaris compilation problem in **phosphor**. * Made xscreensaver notice XFree86's virtual root window hack, so that   if the X server's root window is larger than the monitor's   displayable resolution, the screen saver will limit itself to the   area that actually appears on the screen. * Made the xscreensaver daemon do a better job of picking the visual   class that should be used for GL programs. Less user intervention   should be needed now: you can use the logical visual name **GL**   instead of having to figure out by hand which one to use. * Oops, the visual was defaulting to *“best”* instead of   *“default”*, because the .xscreensaver file was not being   loaded quite early enough. * Made configure figure out how to build icmp ping support into the   **sonar** hack automatically. * Made warnings about not being able to read shadow passwords not be   printed if compiled with PAM support. * Improved PAM startup diagnostics. * Worked around the Solaris PAM bug that was causing crashes there, so   now PAM is turned on by default. * Made configure detect the number of arguments that pam\_strerror()   takes, since on Linux, this apparently changed between 2.0 and 2.2,   sigh. * Made the /proc/interrupts kludge look for *“PS/2 Mouse”* as well as   *“keyboard”*. * Made xscreensaver notice when there has been a sudden large jump in   wall-clock time, and if so, lock right away, instead of waiting for   *“lockTimeout”* to expire first. (Laptops need this for safer   recovery from hibernation.) * Added **-throttle** option to **xscreensaver-command**. | |
| 3.10 | 27-Apr-1999 |
| * Added **phosphor**, **xmatrix**, and **pulsar** hacks. * Fixed a bug in the color allocator that sometimes caused **starfish**   to fall back to monochrome. * Reduced the amount of code that runs before root privileges are   disavowed: *“normal”* and *“shadow”* passwords now do some   initialization as root, but the PAM and Kerberos authorization   schemes will be initialized while running as *“nobody”*. Supposedly   this closes a potential security hole when using Kerberos. * Added some more sanity checking to configure. | |
| 3.09 | 11-Apr-1999 |
| * Added **compass**, **squiral**, **xflame**, **wander**, **spotlight**, and   **critical** hacks. * Added some new modes to **decayscreen**. * Made **deluxe** work in monochrome. * Generalized usage of the Double-Buffer server extension in several   hacks (**compass**, **deluxe**, **interference**, **kumppa**, and **moire2**.) * Fixed another visual-depth problem in **rd-bomb**. * The screen saver will now defer blanking if neither the keyboard nor   the mouse could be grabbed. Instead, it will just try again in a   few minutes. This fixes a bad interaction between xscreensaver and   programs like VMware that hold the mouse and keyboard grabbed for a   long time. * Added a new erase mode (expanding spiral.) | |
| 3.08 | 15-Mar-1999 |
| * Fixed some bugs in my port of **t3d**. * Added **penetrate** and **deluxe** hacks. * When linking against Motif 2.x, also link against XPM. * Added support for using /proc/interrupts for idle detection on   Linux. Now xscreensaver shouldn't kick in when the user is active   on a non-X virtual console. * Upgraded to autoconf 2.13. | |
| 3.07 | 04-Jan-1999 |
| * Configure tweaks (sometimes **-lXmu** wasn't getting linked in properly;   check for \_Xsetlocale in **-lXintl**.) * Portability fixes for sonar.c. * Fixed a compilation problem when you have GL but don't have XPM. * Made configure notice when MesaGL requires **-lpthread**. * Made **flame** ignore SIGFPE (not sure if this is the right fix; it   seems only to be needed on FreeBSD.) * Kludged **rd-bomb** work on visuals that are of depth 24 but that \*do   not\* support pixmaps of depth 32. * Fixed **halo** to work properly in TrueColor. * Changed **xscreensaver.spec** to install the hacks in   /usr/X11R6/lib/xscreensaver/ by default, since that's where recent   Red Hat distributions put them. * Added **t3d** hack. * Updated versions of **crystal**, **hopalong**, and **flow** from   xlockmore. * Imported **demon** and **loop** modes from xlockmore. | |
| 3.06 | 22-Nov-1998 |
| * Oops, the *“default-n”* visual descriptor was broken; it was always   installing a colormap if the **installColormap** preference was set,   meaning that **xearth**, **xv** and friends were using the wrong colors   on 8-bit systems. * Turned off HAVE\_PING in **sonar**, since it compiles on some Linux   systems, but not others of similar vintage... | |
| 3.05 | 20-Nov-1998 |
| * Fixed an off-by-1 in **distort**. * Added **sonar** hack. * New version of **glplanet** (with stars.) * Made all hacks exit when you type **q** or **ESC** at them, and made   them obey the WM\_DELETE\_WINDOW ClientMessage. * Fixed a nonfatal buffer overrun in lament (note: lament still   doesn't work with MesaGL 3.0: it dies in   lambda\_textured\_triangle1(), which is Mesa's bug, not mine.) | |
| 3.04 | 16-Nov-1998 |
| * Added an **xscreensaver.spec** file, to make it easier for other folks   to generate RPMs. * Made the password code work on HPUX in the situation where:   *“enhanced security”* is available; but not used; but the user typed   a password more than 8 characters long anyway. FTSOHPUX. | |
| 3.03 | 15-Nov-1998 |
| * Made locking work when passwd aging is enabled. * Added support for PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules.) It is   still turned off by default, though, since it doesn't seem to work   on Solaris 2.6, and has been behaving erratically on Red Hat 5.1. * Made each possible authentication method be tried in turn until one   succeeds; this means that Kerberos is being used, we will first   check Kerberos, and if that fails, will then consult the local   password file. Likewise with PAM. * Save and restore the bits under the passwd dialog, to avoid leaving   a black rectangle behind when unlocking is cancelled. | |
| 3.02 | 25-Oct-1998 |
| * Not everyone has sys/select.h, sigh... | |
| 3.01 | 24-Oct-1998 |
| * Some fixes to **reflect**. * Configure tweaks. * Made it log unsuccessful attempts to unlock the screen to syslog. * Fixed a bug where **xscreensaver-demo** could be seeing a different   programs list than **xscreensaver** did. | |
| 3.00 | 20-Oct-1998 |
| * The xscreensaver daemon no longer links against Motif or Athena:   demo-mode and the preferences panel are no longer built in to the   daemon, but are now handled by an external program,   **xscreensaver-demo**. (I decided that this, along with the recent   addition of the **.xscreensaver** config file, justified bumping the   version number to 3.00, since this is a fairly major architectural   change.) * Lines in the **\*programs** resource may now begin with the character   *“-”*, meaning *“don't run this hack.”* In this way, it's possible to   disable a hack without throwing away the information about it   (making it easier to change your mind later.) Eventually the   preferences/demo mode GUI should represent this as a checkbox or   something. * Fixed a short race condition where it was possible for xscreensaver   to die with a BadWindow error if it was blanking the screen just as   another window was being deleted. * Made it possible to disable specific modes in **bsod**. | |
| 2.34 | 08-Oct-1998 |
| * Fixed a bug that was making **pipes** generate way too many valves.   Made the viewpoint in **pipes** be selected randomly instead of always   being -10 degrees. * Fixed a bug in the XSHM code, in the case where the server supports   the XSHM extension but is not the same machine as the client. * Made **rd-bomb** default to taking up the whole screen. * Made it not try to do fading/unfading if no PseudoColor visuals   exist. * Initial attempt at supporting VT-locking (doesn't work yet.) * Eliminated the **captureStdout** resource; now **captureStderr**   controls both streams. * Added **-capture-stderr** and **-no-capture-stderr** command-line   arguments. * Added **glplanet** hack. * When a hack is selected with **xscreensaver-command -select**, that   hack will be used until further notice (until the saver turns off,   or another activation command is issued.) | |
| 2.33 | 05-Oct-1998 |
| * Made **xscreensaver-command** print error messages: the xscreensaver   daemon now responds to ClientMessage events by writing a response   message on a window property, instead of just writing to its stderr. * Made the ~/.xscreensaver file be automatically reloaded when the   file date changes. * The password dialog and splash screen no longer depend on Motif or   Athena. This should clear up a number of focus problems, and is the   first step on the path toward moving all of the   Motif/Athena/whatever code out of the xscreensaver daemon, and into   external processes. * Don't complain about LessTif 0.86 any more, since the new password   dialog makes that problem go away. * Configure tweaks for Irix 6.5, SunOS 5.something. * New **-reflect** option to **distort**. | |
| 2.32 | 04-Oct-1998 |
| * Added reading and writing of a ~/.xscreensaver file, so that the   Preferences panel can save its settings. * New version of **rubik**. * Added **-select N** argument to **xscreensaver-command**. * Oops, left out some of the **bubbles3d** files... | |
| 2.31 | 02-Oct-1998 |
| * The cursor was invisible in the password dialog. Fixed. * Made configure warn against MesaGL 2.6. * Fixed X error at startup when using non-default visual. * New version of **crystal**, **ant**, and **atlantis** from xlockmore. * New hack, **bubble3d**. * Added some new modes to **bsod**. | |
| 2.30 | 23-Sep-1998 |
| * Changed the order in which **-lSM** and **-lICE** are linked to be after   Motif instead of before (Lesstif on Irix needs this.) | |
| 2.29 | 23-Sep-1998 |
| * Work around a bash bug in configure. * Tweaked HPUX paths again. FTSOHPUX. * Made configure recommend against LessTif 0.86, due to a bug in that   version that causes a security hole in the screen locking code.   LessTif 0.87 will fix it. * Made all of the **--with** options to **configure** accept a directory   option as well (so that **--with-motif**=/FOO will add -I/FOO/include   -L/FOO/lib). I believe this is the Configure Party Line of how do   to such things. * Fixed a bug where the mouse was left un-grabbed after the first time   the graphics hack was changed (simplified all of the mouse-grabbing   logic.) * Maybe possibly perhaps made **vidwhacker** really not leave stray xv   windows around. This time for sure. * Added a new erase mode (random dots fizzling out.) * Added **-prefs** argument to **xscreensaver-command**, that brings up   the Preferences dialog directly (it seems that nobody ever noticed   the **Preferences** button on the Demo Mode dialog, maybe this will   help.) * Added a splash screen. Turn it off with \*splash:false. | |
| 2.28 | 21-Sep-1998 |
| * Better macsbug text in **bsod**. * New version of **distort** with many new modes. * Plugged a leak in **coral**. * Tweaked configure for HPUX. * Removed some compiler warnings. * More consistent usage of stderr versus stdout. * More diagnostics should an X error occur. * Fixed a possible crash in SGI-specific unfading code. | |
| 2.27 | 04-Aug-1998 |
| * Improved version of **distort**. * Made **lament** compile against OpenGL 1.0 (though it still requires   1.1 to work properly.) * Updated my email address and home page. | |
| 2.25 | 25-Jul-1998 |
| * Improved motion in **rd-bomb**. * Added XSHM (shared memory extension) support to the **distort**,   **interference**, **moire**, **rd-bomb**, and **swirl** hacks, which speeds   them up a bit. * Added **lament** hack. | |
| 2.24 | 30-Jun-1998 |
| * Tweaked the order of the -L options again. * Cleaned up configure's **--help** message. * Added **kumppa** hack. * Smarter maze-solving algorithm in **maze**. * Took **xlyap** out of the default list of hacks, since it's just   incredibly buggy (and slow.) Maybe someday someone will fix it... * Added **distort** hack, but didn't add it to the default list (yet)   because it's still too slow. * Made the Athena demo dialog look more like the Motif version; it has   a text-entry field now, too. * Made the Athena password dialog echo asterisks, like Motif does,   instead of using a flyspeck font. * Some random configure tweaks. * Added a **timestamp** resource that makes the **-verbose** messages   include the time at which they were printed. | |
| 2.23 | 21-Jun-1998 |
| * The fix for SGI's *“scheme”* nonsense broke things, and let the   user's *“\*background”* resource show through. Fixed it in a different   way. | |
| 2.22 | 21-Jun-1998 |
| * Added support for the DPMS server extension (Display Power   Management System.) * Made configure advertize the **--enable-subdir** option a little more,   since that seemed to cause some people stress. Also, made that   directory be built into the xscreensaver executable, as a hardcoded   prefix to $`PATH`. (Might help, shouldn't hurt.) * Made configure prefer the two-arg gettimeofday to the one-arg   version, since AIX doesn't have any prototypes. * Made it work with Xaw3d (the 3D Athena library.) * Made **make install** create directories as necessary. * New version of lmorph from Sverre. * Added **crystal** and **discreet** hacks from xlockmore. * Added a new mode to **bsod**. | |
| 2.21 | 15-Jun-1998 |
| * Made **xscreensaver-command -time** use different words. (It now   describes the two states as *“screen blanked since...”* and *“screen   non-blanked since...”* instead of *“active since...”* and *“inactive   since...”* which a lot of people interpreted as meaning the opposite   of what was intended.) * Improved some error messages, in the hopes of making the distinction   between the xscreensaver and xscreensaver-command programs more   obvious. * Rewrote (and reorganized) parts of the xscreensaver and   xscreensaver-command manual pages. * Renamed xscreensaver's **-lock** command-line option to be   **-lock-mode**, to avoid confusion with the **-lock** option to   xscreensaver-command, which does a totally different thing. * Removed xscreensaver's **-demo** command-line option for a similar   reason; use **xscreensaver-command -demo** instead. * Disabled SGI's *“scheme”* nonsense in a better way than   fully-qualifying the background colors in every single hack. * Fixed some other minor cosmetic problems when \*sgiMode is turned on. * Fixed an X error in **bsod -root** (how ironic...) | |
| 2.20 | 10-Jun-1998 |
| * Fixed a bug that caused the mouse to sometimes not be grabbed   properly (meaning the window manager menu could pop up over the   demo-mode display.) * Fixed a bug that made the stderr output sometimes get printed twice. * Fixed a bug that made the demo-mode scrollbar move too fast. * Protected against a possible buffer overflow. * Made **vidwhacker** not leave stray xv windows around. * New version of **ant** so that Bagley doesn't calve. * Make configure on AIX get XShm from the right library. | |
| 2.19 | 04-Jun-1998 |
| * One file was missing from the tar file. | |
| 2.18 | 04-Jun-1998 |
| * Oops, atlantis wasn't being built by default. * Added **epicycle** hack. * Added **interference** hack. * Added **truchet** hack. * Added **bsod** hack. * Added some new modes to **vidwhacker**. | |
| 2.17 | 02-Jun-1998 |
| * Added a **-window-id** argument to most hacks, so that they can draw on   arbitrary externally-provided windows. * Synched with xlockmore 4.11a01. * Added **flow** hack. * Added **atlantis** GL hack. * Renamed **puzzle** hack to **jigsaw**, since xlock already had a   different mode called **puzzle**. * Made it self-configure properly when Motif 2.1.0 is being used   (requires **-lXp** now, sigh...) | |
| 2.16 | 21-Feb-1998 |
| * Made **flag** able to do XPM images. * New look for the xscreensaver logo (**xroger**). * Fixed compilation error on Suns with adjunct passwords. * Got multi-architecture builds working again. * Some configure tweaks for building on HPUX and Solaris. * Fixed bug in decayscreen. * Fixed typo in passwd.c. * Made **cynosure** not die when colormap is full. | |
| 2.15 | 18-Jan-1998 |
| * Added **cynosure** hack. * Added **moire2** hack. * Tweaked **erase.c** some more. * Made unfading a bit smoother. * Added **vidwhacker** hack (not installed by default.) * Added **stairs** hack. * Split **escher** into **cage** and **moebius**, as per xlockmore. * Changed subprocess handling to use sigaction() instead of signal()   if it's available (this is necessary for SCO but should work fine on   other systems too.) * Various other tweaks. | |
| 2.14 | 21-Dec-1997 |
| * Better fix for the Motif drag-and-die lossage. * Put in some kludges to work around a LessTif bug. * XScreenSaver is known to work with LessTif 0.82 now. * Made fading work on high-end SGI video hardware. * Fixed another SGI-specific bug in screen grabbing; will the madness   never cease? * Fixed another crash in **xlyap**. | |
| 2.13 | 03-Dec-1997 |
| * Made **decayscreen** do directions other than down. * Improved **puzzle**. * Fixed a crash in **xlyap**. * Added CDE info to the man page, removed **cde.txt**. * Configure tweaks for Zippy. * Turned off the signal handling in **bubbles** because it was sometimes   failing to die. * Added **hacks/xscreensaver-sgigl.c** to make it possible to run SGI's   ElectroPaint hack (/usr/demos/bin/ep) with xscreensaver. Finally! * Fixed a buffer overrun in the locking code that some wily, malicious   cracker must have slipped in. * Disabled Motif drag-and-drool in the dialog box buttons, since it's   broken in some old versions of Motif. | |
| 2.12 | 25-Nov-1997 |
| * Added **README.debugging**. * Added **puzzle** hack. * Added **xlyap** hack. * Added **default-n** as a visual name, so that one can have **-install** on   by default, but turn it off for certain poorly-behaved hacks (like   xv.) * Added support for grabbing frames of external video (on SGI) to the   screen-grabbing hacks (decayscreen, slidescreen, slip, blitspin, and   puzzle.) * Improved look of tiles in **slidescreen**; fixed its color allocation   problem. | |
| 2.11 | 17-Nov-1997 |
| * Tweaked **blitspin**, added it to the default list. * Added **lissie**, **mountain**, **triangle**, **worm**, **rotor**, and **ant**   from xlockmore. * Updated **sierpinski**, **galaxy**, and **lisa**. * Thickened the lines in **braid** and **lmorph**. * Updated VMS makefiles. * Renamed **fract** to **vines**. * Added **xjack** hack. * Made a few more hacks use erase.c, and added a few more wipe styles. * Fixed compilation problem with Sun's version of OpenGL. * Added ability to use sigaction() instead of signal()   to work around a SCO kernel bug. | |
| 2.10 | 18-Oct-1997 |
| * Fixed colormap bugs in **rd-bomb**; sped up **coral**. * Configure tweaks for \*BSD. | |
| 2.08 | 07-Oct-1997 |
| * New hacks **rd-bomb** and **coral**. * New version of **maze** with some new algorithms. * New colorized version of **rocks**. * Fixed a bug in qix on 64-bit machines. * Fixed a bug in the **-time** option. * Fixed a bug in configure related to LessTif. | |
| 2.07 | 04-Aug-1997 |
| * Minor header tweaks in windows.c and flag.c. * Made multi-architecture ($`VPATH`) builds work properly. * Merged new GL stuff from xlockmore (rubik, morph3d.) * Fixed intermittent crashes in **imsmap** and **munch**. * Added **fadeplot** hack from xlockmore. | |
| 2.06 | 26-Jul-1997 |
| * Merged in VMS support from Patrick Moreau. | |
| 2.05 | 07-Jul-1997 |
| * Fixed a `MIT-SCREEN-SAVER`-related crash, and tweaked   configure to detect the extra-random **-lXss** library. | |
| 2.04 | 29-Jun-1997 |
| * HP configure tweaks. Detect and warn about LessTif. * Fixed low-color behavior of **goop**, **pyro**, **starfish**,   **greynetic**, **flame**, **halo**, and **moire**. | |
| 2.03 | 25-Jun-1997 |
| * Fixed flicker in **pipes**. Fixed 3d in **bouboule**. * Added **munch** hack. * Added basic dependencies to the Makefile.in files. | |
| 2.02 | 20-Jun-1997 |
| * Fixes for compiling with the MIT saver extension. * Made the yow/fortune program be a configure option. * Various configure tweaks. | |
| 2.01 | 16-Jun-1997 |
| * Added **goop** and **starfish** hacks. * Added colomap cycling to **halo**. * Made **attraction** use the new colormap allocator. * Added better $`PATH` diagnostics. * There was a bug in frand! Color selection should be much improved   now. | |
| 2.00 | 10-Jun-1997 |
| * Converted to use **configure** instead of **imake**. * ANSI C is now required. * Added Kerberos locking support, from Nat Lanza. * Made the stderr text use overlay planes, if possible. * Reworked the xlockmore compatibility stuff again. * Added **gears**, **superquadrics**, **escher**, **pipes**, and **sproingies**   hacks (depend on OpenGL.) | |
| 1.34 | 31-May-1997 |
| * Fixed some bugs, made fading be a little smoother. | |
| 1.33 | 31-May-1997 |
| * Made it work with multi-headed displays. * Generalized sub-process management (Unix sucks!) * Added interactive mouse frobbing to Julia. * Added (untested) support for HPUX shadow passwords. * Made normal non-shadow passwords be checked if the shadow passwords   aren't accessible for some reason. | |
| 1.32 | 27-May-1997 |
| * Removed \*colorPrograms and \*monoPrograms resources: made it possible   to specify the desired visual on a per-hack basis. * Cleaned up / restructured the driver: no more globals. * Made the Motif and Athena dialogs share more code. * Probably fixed some Athena colormap-installation bugs. * Fixed screen grabbing (cmap) on SGI 12-bit PseudoColor. * Fixed divide-by-zero in bright random colormaps. * Added an improved version of xlock's **flag** hack. * Made unfading work better, and not flicker on SGIs. * Added **sphere**, **forest**, **lisa** hacks from xlockmore. * Added (untested) support for SunOS Adjunct passwords. | |
| 1.31 | 18-May-1997 |

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage

Seconded. Had I known that Purl would take off I would have added it to the original *CVE* JSON specification I wrote.
