Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2518:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- In the `tomoyo_mount_acl()` function within the Linux kernel's TOMOYO security module, the `kern_path()` function was called without verifying if `dev_name` was not NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:**  The lack of a NULL check on `dev_name` before calling `kern_path(dev_name)` leads to a potential NULL pointer dereference if `dev_name` is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Kernel oops (crash):** An unprivileged user can trigger a kernel oops, leading to a denial of service, by exploiting the missing NULL check.

**Attack vectors:**
- **`mount()` system call:** An unprivileged user can trigger the vulnerability by issuing a `mount(NULL, "/", "ext3", 0, NULL)` system call where `dev_name` would be NULL in the `tomoyo_mount_acl` function

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unprivileged user:** An unprivileged user on the system is sufficient to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability existed in the Linux kernel since version 2.6.36.
- The fix involves adding a check for `dev_name != NULL` before calling `kern_path()`.
