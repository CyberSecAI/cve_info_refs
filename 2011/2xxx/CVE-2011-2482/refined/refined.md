  "CVE-2011-2482": {
    "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation. A remote attacker could send a specially-crafted SCTP packet to a target system, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "A missing chunk of an upstream commit related to receive memory management in the SCTP implementation was not included in a backport. Later, when updated socket memory accounting was added, the missing chunk was necessary. This resulted in memory for chunks in the reassembly and lobby queues not being reclaimed, and the queues were assumed to be purged, leading to a null pointer dereference when attempting to free memory that was already freed.",
