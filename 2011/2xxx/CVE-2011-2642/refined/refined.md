Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2011-2642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in phpMyAdmin's table print view. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize table names when displaying them in the print view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS.  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through a crafted table name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's phpMyAdmin session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
   - Session hijacking: stealing the user's session cookie, gaining access to the application
   - Data theft: exfiltrating sensitive data from the database
   - Defacement: altering the visual presentation of the application
   - Phishing: redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites.
   - Other client-side attacks via JavaScript

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves tricking a victim into accessing a phpMyAdmin table print view page with a crafted URL containing a malicious table name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create tables on the victim's MySQL server. This could be through direct access or by exploiting another vulnerability allowing table creation.
- The attacker must then craft a URL, including the malicious table name, and trick a valid phpMyAdmin user into accessing it (e.g., through a phishing link or compromised web page).
- The attacker needs to know the victim is using the vulnerable version of phpMyAdmin.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "minor" by the phpMyAdmin team
- The issue affects phpMyAdmin versions 3.4.3.1 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in phpMyAdmin versions 3.3.10.3 and 3.4.3.2.

In summary, CVE-2011-2642 describes an XSS vulnerability in phpMyAdmin where a malicious table name can be used to inject JavaScript code when a user views the print version of the table, provided the attacker can create a table.
