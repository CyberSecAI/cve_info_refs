  "CVE-2011-2373": {
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in Mozilla Firefox when viewing a XUL document with Javascript disabled. Under certain conditions, accessing a XUL document with scripts disabled causes deleted memory to be accessed.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the browser.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By enticing a user to open a malicious XUL document with Javascript disabled."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to host a malicious XUL document and get a victim to open it in a vulnerable browser with Javascript disabled. User interaction is required."
