<http://dovecot.org/releases/2.0/dovecot-2.0.13.tar.gz.sig>

I've almost managed to read my email backlog, but there are still some
unanswered mails. Feel free to resend if you think I should have
answered some of your mails.

The most important changes since v2.0.12:

	+ Added "doveadm index" command to add unindexed messages into
	  index/cache. If full text search is enabled, it also adds unindexed
	  messages to the fts database.
	+ added "doveadm director dump" command.
	+ pop3: Added support for showing messages in "POP3 order", which can
	  be different from IMAP message order. This can be useful for
	  migrations from other servers. Implemented it for Maildir as 'O'
	  field in dovecot-uidlist.
	- doveconf: Fixed a wrong "subsection has ssl=yes" warning.
	- mdbox purge: Fixed wrong warning about corrupted extrefs.
	- sdbox: INBOX GUID changed when INBOX was autocreated, leading to
	  trouble with dsync.
	- script-login binary wasn't actually dropping privileges to the
	  user/group/chroot specified by its service settings.
	- Fixed potential crashes and other problems when parsing header names
	  that contained NUL characters.

```

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=754980#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-11-18 13:22:01 UTC  ``` A security flaw was found in the way Dovecot, an IMAP and POP3 email server, performed remote server identity verification (x509 certificate's Common Name field was not checked to match provided remote server host name), when Dovecot was configured to proxy IMAP and POP3 connections to remote hosts and TLS/SSL protocols were requested (ssl=yes or starttls=yes) in the configuration to secure these connections to the destination server. A remote attacker could use this flaw to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via specially-crafted x509v3 certificate.

=== Content from www.dovecot.org_b55c0316_20250125_003137.html ===
v2.0.21 2012-06-12 Timo Sirainen
+ dict: file backend supports now also fcntl/flock locking optionally
- imap-login: Memory leak fixed
- imap: Non-UTF8 input on SEARCH command parameters could have crashed
- auth: Fixed crash with DIGEST-MD5 when attempting to do master user
login without master passdbs.
- sdbox: Don't use more fds than necessary when copying mails.
- mdbox kept the user's storage locked a bit longer than it needed to
v2.0.20 2012-04-09 Timo Sirainen
+ doveadm user: Added -m parameter to show some of the mail settings.
- doveadm import didn't import messages' flags
- Make sure IMAP clients can't create directories when accessing
nonexistent users' mailboxes via shared namespace.
- Dovecot auth clients authenticating via TCP socket could have failed
with bogus "PID already in use" errors.
v2.0.19 2012-03-15 Timo Sirainen
- IMAP: ENABLE CONDSTORE/QRESYNC + STATUS for a mailbox might not
have seen latest external changes to it, like new mails.
- imap\_id\_\* settings were ignored before login.
- doveadm altmove did too much work sometimes, retrying moves
it had already done.
- mbox: Fixed accessing Dovecot v1.x mbox index files without errors.
v2.0.18 2012-02-12 Timo Sirainen
+ DIGEST-MD5 authentication supports authorization id now.
Patch by Yubao Liu
+ Added instance\_name setting which is used to prefix Dovecot
processes in ps output.
- LDA/LMTP: Sending a large mail via submission\_host or via LMTP proxy
may have caused a hang.
- Fixed dbox + mail\_attachment\_dir + zlib problems.
- Login processes weren't logging all intended messages with
auth\_verbose=yes
- IMAP: THREAD REFS sometimes returned invalid (0) nodes.
- IMAP: CONTEXT search return option wasn't handled at all.
- dbox: Various error handling fixes.
- snarf plugin: Keep the mailbox locked during snarfing to avoid
duplicates.
v2.0.17 2012-01-06 Timo Sirainen
+ Proxying now supports sending SSL client certificate to server with
ssl\_client\_cert/key settings.
+ doveadm dump: Added support for dumping dbox headers/metadata.
- Fixed memory leaks in login processes with SSL connections
- vpopmail support was broken in v2.0.16
v2.0.16 2011-11-17 Timo Sirainen
\* VSZ limits weren't being enforced for any processes. On server with
large mailboxes you may now see errors about it if the limits aren't
high enough. To fix them, either increase individual service {
vsz\_limit } values or simply increase the default\_vsz\_limit setting.
\* Proxying: If using ssl=yes or starttls=yes with a hostname (not IP)
as proxy destination, require that the certificate matches the given
hostname.
\* LMTP: Changed default client\_limit to 1. This should improve LMTP
throughput with default settings.
\* dsync: Quota is no longer enforced (i.e. dsync can't fail because
user is over quota).
+ Added "auto" mail storage driver, which can be used to autodetect
mailbox location and format. This behavior is already the default
for empty mail\_location setting, so this change is mainly useful for
shared namespace's location setting.
+ checkpassword: Export all auth %variables to AUTH\_\* environment.
v2.0.15 2011-09-16 Timo Sirainen
+ doveadm altmove: Added -r parameter to move mails back to primary
storage.
- v2.0.14: Index reading could have eaten a lot of memory in some
situations
- doveadm index no longer affects future caching decisions
- mbox: Fixed crash during mail delivery when mailbox didn't yet have
GUID assigned to it.
- zlib+mbox: Fetching last message from compressed mailboxes crashed.
- lib-sql: Fixed load balancing and error handling when multiple hosts
are used.
v2.0.14 2011-08-29 Timo Sirainen
+ doveadm: Added support for running mail commands by proxying to
another doveadm server.
+ Added "doveadm proxy list" and "doveadm proxy kick" commands to
list/kick proxy connections (via a new "ipc" service).
+ Added "doveadm director move" to assign user from one server to
another, killing any existing connections.
+ Added "doveadm director ring status" command.
+ userdb extra fields can now return name+=value to append to an
existing name, e.g. "mail\_plugins+= quota".
- script-login attempted an unnecessary config lookup, which usually
failed with "Permission denied".
- lmtp: Fixed parsing quoted strings with spaces as local-part for
MAIL FROM and RCPT TO.
- imap: FETCH BODY[HEADER.FIELDS (..)] may have crashed or not
returned all data sometimes.
- ldap: Fixed random assert-crashing with with sasl\_bind=yes.
- Fixes to handling mail chroots
- Fixed renaming mailboxes under different parent with FS layout when
using separate ALT, INDEX or CONTROL paths.
- zlib: Fixed reading concatenated .gz files.
v2.0.13 2011-05-11 Timo Sirainen
+ Added "doveadm index" command to add unindexed messages into
index/cache. If full text search is enabled, it also adds unindexed
messages to the fts database.
+ added "doveadm director dump" command.
+ pop3: Added support for showing messages in "POP3 order", which can
be different from IMAP message order. This can be useful for
migrations from other servers. Implemented it for Maildir as 'O'
field in dovecot-uidlist.
- doveconf: Fixed a wrong "subsection has ssl=yes" warning.
- mdbox purge: Fixed wrong warning about corrupted extrefs.
- sdbox: INBOX GUID changed when INBOX was autocreated, leading to
trouble with dsync.
- script-login binary wasn't actually dropping privileges to the
user/group/chroot specified by its service settings.
- Fixed potential crashes and other problems when parsing header names
that contained NUL characters.
v2.0.12 2011-04-12 Timo Sirainen
+ doveadm: Added "move" command for moving mails between mailboxes.
+ virtual: Added support for "+mailbox" entries that clear \Recent
flag from messages (default is to preserve them).
- dbox: Fixes to handling external attachments
- dsync: More fixes to avoid hanging with remote syncs
- dsync: Many other syncing/correctness fixes
- doveconf: v2.0.10 and v2.0.11 didn't output plugin {} section right
v2.0.11 2011-03-07 Timo Sirainen
\* dotlock\_use\_excl setting's default was accidentally "no" in all
v2.0.x releases, instead of "yes" as in v1.1 and v1.2. Changed it
back to "yes."
- v2.0.10: LDAP support was broken
- v2.0.10: dsyncing to remote often hanged (timed out in 15 mins)
v2.0.10 2011-03-04 Timo Sirainen
\* LMTP: For user+detail@domain deliveries, the +detail is again written
to Delivered-To: header.
\* Skip auth penalty checks from IPs in login\_trusted\_networks.
+ Added import\_environment setting.
+ Added submission\_host setting to send mails via SMTP instead of
via sendmail binary.
+ Added doveadm acl get/set/delete commands for ACL manipulation,
similar to how IMAP ACL extension works.
+ Added doveadm acl debug command to help debug and fix problems
with why shared mailboxes aren't working as expected.
- IMAP: Fixed hangs with COMPRESS extension
- IMAP: Fixed a hang when trying to COPY to a nonexistent mailbox.
- IMAP: Fixed hang/crash with SEARCHRES + pipelining $.
- IMAP: Fixed assert-crash if IDLE+DONE is sent in same TCP packet.
- LMTP: Fixed sending multiple messages in a session.
- doveadm: Fixed giving parameters to mail commands.
- doveadm import: Settings weren't correctly used for the
import storage.
- dsync: Fixed somewhat random failures with saving messages to
remote dsync.
- v2.0.9: Config reload didn't notify running processes with
shutdown\_clients=no, so they could have kept serving new clients
with old settings.
v2.0.9 2011-01-13 Timo Sirainen
- Linux: Fixed a high system CPU usage / high context switch count
performance problem
- Maildir: Avoid unnecessarily reading dovecot-uidlist while opening
mailbox.
- Maildir: Fixed renaming child mailboxes when namespace had a prefix.
- mdbox: Don't leave partially written messages to mdbox files when
aborting saving.
- Fixed master user logins when using userdb prefetch
- lda: Fixed a crash when trying to send "out of quota" reply
- lmtp: If delivering duplicate messages to same user's INBOX,
create different GUIDs for them. This helps to avoid duplicate
POP3 UIDLs when pop3\_uidl\_format=%g.
- virtual storage: Fixed saving multiple mails in a transaction
(e.g. copy multiple messages).
- dsync: Saved messages' save-date was set to 1970-01-01.
v2.0.8 2010-12-03 Timo Sirainen
\* Services' default vsz\_limits weren't being enforced correctly in
earlier v2.0 releases. Now that they are enforced, you might notice
that the default limits are too low and you need to increase them.
This problem will show up in logs as "out of memory" errors.
See default\_vsz\_limit and service { vsz\_limit } settings.
\* LMTP: In earlier versions if mail was delivered to user+detail@domain
address, LMTP server always attempted to deliver the mail to mailbox
named "detail". This was rather unintentional and shouldn't have been
the default. lmtp\_save\_to\_detail\_mailbox=yes setting now preserves
this behavior (default is no).
+ Added systemd support (configure --with-systemdsystemunitdir).
Based on patch by Christophe Fergeau.
+ Replaced broken mbox-snarf plugin with a new more generic snarf
plugin.
- dbox: Fixes to handling external mail attachments
- verbose\_proctitle=yes didn't work for all processes in v2.0.7
- imap, pop3: When service { client\_count } was larger than 1, the
log messages didn't use the correct prefix. Last logged in user's
prefix was always used, regardless of what user's session actually
logged it. Now the proper log prefix is always used.
- MySQL: Only the first specified host was ever used
v2.0.7 2010-11-08 Timo Sirainen
\* master: default\_process\_limit wasn't actually used anywhere,
rather the default was unlimited. Now that it is enforced, you might
notice that the default limit is too low and you need to increase it.
Dovecot logs a warning when this happens.
\* mail-log plugin: Log mailbox name as virtual name rather than
physical name (e.g. namespace prefix is included in the name)
+ doveadm dump: Added imapzlib type to uncompress IMAP's
COMPRESS DEFLATE I/O traffic (e.g. from rawlog).
- IMAP: Fixed LIST-STATUS when listing subscriptions with
subscriptions=no namespaces.
- IMAP: Fixed SELECT QRESYNC not to crash on mailbox close if a lot of
changes were being sent.
- quota: Don't count virtual mailboxes in quota
- doveadm expunge didn't always actually do the physical expunging
- Fixed some index reading optimizations introduced by v2.0.5.
- LMTP proxying fixes
v2.0.6 2010-10-21 Timo Sirainen
\* Pre-login CAPABILITY includes IDLE again. Mainly to make Blackberry
servers happy.
\* auth: auth\_cache\_negative\_ttl default was 0 in earlier v2.0.x, but it
was supposed to be 1 hour as in v1.x. Changed it back to 1h.
If you want it disabled, make sure doveconf shows it as 0.
+ dbox: Added support for saving mail attachments to external files,
with also support for single instance storage. This feature hasn't
had much testing yet, so be careful with it.
+ doveadm: Added import command for importing mails from other storages.
+ Reduced NFS I/O operations for index file accesses
+ dbox, Maildir: When copying messages, copy also already cached fields
from dovecot.index.cache
+ mdbox: Added mdbox\_preallocate\_space setting (Linux+ext4/XFS only)
- Maildir: LDA/LMTP assert-crashed sometimes when saving a mail.
- Fixed leaking fds when writing to dovecot.mailbox.log.
- Fixed rare dovecot.index.cache corruption
- IMAP: SEARCH YOUNGER/OLDER wasn't working correctly
v2.0.5 2010-10-01 Timo Sirainen
\* acl: Fixed the logic of merging multiple ACL entries. Now it works as
documented, while previously it could have done slightly different
things depending on the order of the entries.
\* virtual: Allow opening virtual mailboxes that refer to non-existing
mailboxes. It seems that the benefits of this outweigh the lack of
error message when typoing a mailbox name.
+ Added some disk I/O optimizations to Maildir and index code. They're
especially helpful with short-lived connections like POP3.
+ pop3: Added pop3\_fast\_size\_lookups setting.
- doveconf sometimes failed with complaining about missing ssl\_key
setting, causing e.g. dovecot-lda to fail.
- lda: If there's an error in configuration, doveconf didn't exit with
EX\_TEMPFAIL as it should have.
- sdbox: Fixed memory leak when copying messages with hard links.
- zlib + sdbox combination didn't work
- zlib: Fixed several crashes, which mainly showed up with mbox.
- quota: Don't crash if user has quota disabled, but plugin loaded.
- doveadm fetch uid was actually returning sequence, not uid.
- v2.0.4's subscription listing ignored (and logged a warning about)
subscriptions=no namespaces' entries in some configurations.
(So listing shared mailboxes' subscriptions could have been broken.)
- acl: Fixed crashing when sometimes listing shared mailboxes via
dict proxy.
v2.0.4 2010-09-26 Timo Sirainen
\* multi-dbox: If :INDEX=path is specified, keep
storage/dovecot.map.index\* files also in the index path rather than
in the main storage directory.
WARNING: if you specified :INDEX= with earlier mdbox installation,
you must now manually move the storage indexes to the expected
directory! Otherwise Dovecot won't see them and will rebuild the
indexes, possibly unexpunging some mails.
- Maildir: Copying messages with hard links sometimes caused the
source maildir's entire tmp/ directory to be renamed to destination
maildir as if it were a message.
- Maildir: v2.0.3 broke expunging copied messages sometimes
- Maildir: INBOX whose tmp/ directory was lost couldn't be opened
- single-dbox: Messages weren't copied with hard links
- vpopmail support is hopefully working again.
- dsync: POP3 UIDLs weren't copied with Maildir
- dict file: Fixed fd leak (showed up easily with LMTP + quota)
v2.0.3 2010-09-17 Timo Sirainen
\* dovecot-lda: Removed use of non-standard Envelope-To: header as a
default for -a. Set lda\_original\_recipient\_header=Envelope-To to
returns the old behavior.
+ Added support for reverse quota warnings (i.e. when quota goes back
under the limit). This is enabled by adding '-' to beginning of
quota\_warning value. Based on patch by Jeroen Koekkoek.
+ dovecot-lda: Added lda\_original\_recipient\_header setting, which is
used for getting original recipient if -a isn't used.
+ dovecot-lda: Added -r parameter to specify final recipient address.
(It may differ from original address for e.g. aliases.)
+ Maildir: uidlist file can now override message's GUID, making it
possible for multiple messages in a mailbox to have the same GUID.
This also fixes dsync's message conflict resolution.
- dovecot-lda: If destination user isn't found, exit with EX\_NOUSER,
not EX\_TEMPFAIL.
- dsync: Fixed handling \Noselect mailboxes
- Fixed an infinite loop introduced by v2.0.2's message parser changes.
- Fixed a crash introduced by v2.0.2's istream-crlf changes.
v2.0.2 2010-09-08 Timo Sirainen
\* vpopmail support is disabled for now, since it's broken. You can use
it via checkpassword support or its sql/ldap database directly.
- maildir: Fixed "duplicate uidlist entry" errors that happened at
least with LMTP when mail was delivered to multiple recipients
- Deleting ACLs didn't cause entries to be removed from acl\_shared\_dict
- mail\_max\_lock\_timeout setting wasn't working with all locks
- auth\_cache\_size setting's old-style value wasn't autoconverted
and it usually also caused a crash
v2.0.1 2010-08-24 Timo Sirainen
\* When dsync is started as root, remote dsync command is now also
executed as root instead of with dropped privileges.
- IMAP: QRESYNC parameters for SELECT weren't handled correctly.
- UTF-8 string validity checking wasn't done correctly (e.g.
mailbox names in Sieve fileinto)
- dsync: Fixed a random assert-crash with remote dsyncing
v2.0.0 2010-08-16 Timo Sirainen
\* Dovecot uses two system users for internal purposes now by default:
dovenull and dovecot. You need to create the dovenull user or change
default\_login\_user setting.
\* Global ACLs are now looked up using namespace prefixes. For example
if you previously had INBOX. namespace prefix and a global ACL for
"INBOX.Sent", it's now looked up from "INBOX.Sent" file instead of
"Sent" as before.
\* Maildir: File permissions are no longer based on dovecot-shared file,
but the mailbox directory.
+ Redesigned master process. It's now more modular and there is less
code running as root.
+ Configuration supports now per-local/remote ip/network settings.
+ dsync utility does a two-way mailbox synchronization.
+ LMTP server and proxying.
+ Added mdbox (multi-dbox) mail storage backend.
+ doveadm utility can be used to do all kinds of administration
functions. Old dovecotpw and \*view utilities now exist in its
subcommands.
+ imap and pop3 processes can now handle multiple connections.
+ IMAP: COMPRESS=DEFLATE is supported by imap\_zlib plugin
+ director service helps NFS installations to redirect users always
to same server to avoid corruption
v2.0.rc6 2010-08-13 Timo Sirainen
- dict quota didn't always decrease quota when messages were expunged
- Shared INBOX wasn't always listed with FS layout
v2.0.rc5 2010-08-09 Timo Sirainen
- Using more than 2 plugins could have caused broken behavior
(more fixes for this)
- Listescape plugin fixes
- mbox: Fixed a couple of assert-crashes
- mdbox: Fixed potential assert-crash when saving multiple messages
in one transaction.
v2.0.rc4 2010-08-04 Timo Sirainen
+ director: Added director\_doveadm\_port for accepting doveadm
TCP connections.
+ doveadm: Added client/server architecture support for running mail
commands. Enable this by setting doveadm\_worker\_count to non-zero.
+ mail-log: Added support for mailbox\_create event.
+ imap\_capability = +XFOO BAR can be used to add capabilities instead
of replacing the whole capability string.
+ virtual storage: Added support for IDLE notifications.
- doveadm mailbox status: Fixed listing non-ASCII mailbox names.
- doveadm fetch: Fixed output when fetching message header or body
- doveadm director map/add/remove: Fixed handling IP address as
parameter.
- dsync: A few more fixes
v2.0.rc3 2010-07-20 Timo Sirainen
\* Single-dbox is now called "sdbox" instead of "dbox".
"dbox" will stay as an alias for it for now.
+ Added mail\_temp\_dir setting, used by deliver and lmtp for creating
temporary mail files. Default is /tmp.
+ doveadm: Added "director map" command to list user -> host mappings.
- imap: Fixed checking if list=children namespace has children.
- director: If all login processes died, director stopped reading
proxy-notify input and caused future login processes to hang
- mail\_log plugin configuration was broken
- Using more than 2 plugins could have caused broken behavior
- mdbox: Race condition fixes related to copying and purging
- dsync: Lots of fixes
v2.0.rc2 2010-07-09 Timo Sirainen
- Fixed a crash with empty mail\_plugins
- Fixed sharing INBOX to other users
- mdbox: Rebuilding storage was broken in rc1
- dsync was broken for remote syncs in rc1
- director+LMTP proxy wasn't working correctly
- v1.x config parser failed with some settings if pigeonhole wasn't
installed.
- virtual: If non-matching messages weren't expunged within same
session, they never got expunged.
v2.0.rc1 2010-07-02 Timo Sirainen
\* See v2.0.0 notes
v1.2.6 2009-10-05 Timo Sirainen
\* Upgraded to Unicode 5.2.0
+ Added authtest utility for doing passdb and userdb lookups.
+ login: ssl\_security string now also shows the used compression.
- quota: Don't crash with non-Maildir++ quota backend.
- imap proxy: Fixed crashing with some specific password characters.
- dovecot --exec-mail was broken.
- Avoid assert-crashing when two processes try to create index at the
same time.
v1.2.5 2009-09-13 Timo Sirainen
\* Authentication: DIGEST-MD5 and RPA mechanisms no longer require
user's login realm to be listed in auth\_realms. It only made
configuration more difficult without really providing extra security.
\* zlib plugin: Don't allow clients to save compressed data directly.
This prevents users from exploiting (most of the) potential security
holes in zlib/bzlib.
+ Added pop3\_save\_uidl setting.
+ dict quota: When updating quota and user isn't already in dict,
recalculate and save the quota.
- file\_set\_size() was broken with OSes that didn't support
posix\_fallocate() (almost everyone except Linux), causing all kinds
of index file errors.
- v1.2.4 index file handling could have caused an assert-crash
- IMAP: Fixes to QRESYNC extension.
- virtual plugin: Crashfix
- deliver: Don't send rejects to any messages that have Auto-Submitted
header. This avoids emails loops.
- Maildir: Performance fixes, especially with maildir\_very\_dirty\_syncs.
- Maildir++ quota: Limits weren't read early enough from maildirsize
file (when quota limits not enforced by Dovecot)
- Message decoding fixes (mainly for IMAP SEARCH, Sieve).
v1.2.4 2009-08-17 Timo Sirainen
\* acl: When looking up ACL defaults, use global/local default files
if they exist. So it's now possible to set default ACLs by creating
dovecot-acl file to the mail root directory.
+ imap/pop3 proxy: If proxy destination is known to be down,
fail connections to it immediately.
+ imap/pop3 proxy: Added proxy\_timeout passdb extra field to specify
proxy's connect timeout.
- Fixed a crash in index file handling.
- Fixed a crash in saving messages where message contained a CR
character that wasn't followed by LF (and the CR happened to be the
last character in an internal buffer).
- v1.2.3 crashed when listing shared namespace prefix.
- listescape plugin: Several fixes.
- autocreate plugin: Fixed autosubscribing to mailboxes in
subscriptions=no namespaces.
v1.2.3 2009-08-07 Timo Sirainen
\* Mailbox names with control characters can't be created anymore.
Existing mailboxes can still be accessed though.
+ Allow namespace prefix to be opened as mailbox, if a mailbox
already exists in the root dir.
- Maildir: dovecot-uidlist was being recreated every time a mailbox
was accessed, even if nothing changed.
- listescape plugin was somewhat broken
- Compiling fixes for non-Linux/BSDs
- imap: tb-extra-mailbox-sep workaround was broken.
- ldap: Fixed hang when >128 requests were sent at once.
- fts\_squat: Fixed crashing when searching virtual mailbox.
- imap: Fixed THREAD .. INTHREAD crashing.
v1.2.2 2009-07-27 Timo Sirainen
\* GSSAPI: More changes to authentication. Hopefully good now.
\* lazy\_expunge plugin: Drop \Deleted flag when moving message.
+ dovecot -n/-a now outputs also lda settings.
+ dovecot.conf !include now supports globs (e.g.
!include /etc/dovecot/\*.conf). Based on patch by Thomas Guthmann.
+ acl: Support spaces in user/group identifiers.
+ shared mailboxes: If only %%n is specified in prefix, default to
current user's domain.
- Dovecot master process could hang if it received signals too rapidly.
- Fixed "corrupted index cache file" errors (and perhaps others) caused
by e.g. IMAP's FETCH BODY[] command.
- IMAP: When QRESYNC is enabled, don't crash when a new mail is
received while IDLEing.
- IMAP: FETCH X-\* parameters weren't working.
- Maildir++ quota: Quota was sometimes updated wrong when it was
being recalculated.
- Searching quoted-printable message body internally converted "\_"
characters to spaces and didn't match search keys with "\_".
- Messages in year's first/last day may have had broken timezones
with OSes not having struct tm->tm\_gmtoff (e.g. Solaris).
- virtual plugin: If another session adds a new mailbox to index,
don't crash.
v1.2.1 2009-07-09 Timo Sirainen
\* GSSAPI: Changed logging levels and improved the messages.
Changed the way cross-realm authentication handling is done,
hopefully it's working now for everyone.
\* imap/pop3 logins now fail if home directory path is relative.
v1.2.0 deliver was already failing with these and they could have
caused problems even with v1.1.
\* IMAP: Custom authentication failure messages are now prefixed with
[ALERT] to get more clients to actually show them.
+ Improved some error messages.
- pop3: AUTH PLAIN was broken when SASL initial response wasn't given.
- mbox: New mailboxes were created with UIDVALIDITY 1.
- quota-fs was defaulting to group quota instead of user quota.
- Fixed ACLs to work with mbox.
- Fixed fchmod(-1, -1) errors with BSDs
- convert plugin / convert-tool: Fixed changing hierarchy separators
in mailbox names when alt\_hierarchy\_char isn't set.
v1.2.0 2009-07-01 Timo Sirainen
\* When creating files or directories to mailboxes, Dovecot now uses
the mailbox directory's permissions and GID for them. Previous
versions simply used 0600 mode always. For backwards compatibility
dovecot-shared file's permissions still override these with Maildir.
\* SQL dictionary (quota) configuration file is different than in v1.1.
See doc/dovecot-dict-sql-example.conf for the new format.
\* deliver -m: Mailbox name is now assumed to be in UTF-8 format,
not modified-UTF7. Stephan Bosch's new Sieve implementation also
assumes UTF-8 format in fileinto parameters.
+ Full support for shared mailboxes and IMAP ACL extension.
The code is mainly from Sascha Wilde and Bernhard Herzog.
+ IMAP: Added support for extensions: CONDSTORE, QRESYNC, ESEARCH,
ESORT, SEARCHRES, WITHIN, ID and CONTEXT=SEARCH.
+ SEARCH supports INTHREAD search key, but the rest of the INTHREAD
draft isn't implemented yet so it's not advertised in capability.
+ THREAD REFS algorithm where threads are sorted by their latest
message instead of the thread root message. There is also no base
subject merging.
+ IMAP: Implemented imap-response-codes draft.
+ Thread indexes for optimizing IMAP THREAD command and INTHREAD
search key.
+ Added userdb checkpassword (by Sascha Wilde)
+ Virtual mailboxes: http://wiki.dovecot.org/Plugins/Virtual
+ Autocreate plugin: http://wiki.dovecot.org/Plugins/Autocreate
+ Listescape plugin: http://wiki.dovecot.org/Plugins/Listescape
v1.2.rc8 2009-06-30 Timo Sirainen
- Fixed building LDAP as plugin
- Fixed starting up in OS X
v1.2.rc7 2009-06-27 Timo Sirainen
\* Removed configure --with-deliver, --with-pop3d and --disable-ipv6
parameters.
+ Improved permission related error messages.
- mbox: Don't write garbage to mbox if message doesn't have a body.
- virtual: Fixed saving messages with keywords.
- virtual: Fixed infinite looping bug.
- zlib: Fixed error handling.
v1.2.rc6 2009-06-22 Timo Sirainen
\* imap proxy: Pass through to client unexpected untagged replies
from remote server (e.g. alerts).
\* Solr: Don't use "any" copyfield, it doubles the index size.
\* mail\_location: Allow using ":" characters in dir names by escaping
it as "::".
- mbox: Don't crash with invalid From\_-lines.
- IMAP: Don't crash if IDLE command is pipelined after a long-running
UID FETCH or UID SEARCH.
- ACL / shared mailbox fixes
- Some metadata files were incorrectly getting 0666 permissions.
v1.2.rc5 2009-06-04 Timo Sirainen
\* auth\_cache\_negative\_ttl is now used also for password mismatches
(currently only with plaintext authentication mechanisms).
+ Added support for EXTERNAL SASL mechanism.
+ FETCH X-SAVEDATE can now be used to get messages' save timestamps
+ deliver\_log\_format: %s is now in UTF8
- If message body started with a space, some operations could have
assert-crashed.
- Fixed using LDAP support as a plugin
- Fixes to virtual mailboxes.
v1.2.rc4 2009-05-17 Timo Sirainen
\* If /dev/arandom exists, use it instead of /dev/urandom (OpenBSD).
\* When logging to a file, the lines now start with a timestamp instead
of "dovecot: " prefix.
+ IMAP: When multiple commands are pipelined, try harder to combine
their mailbox syncing together. For example with Maildir pipelining
STORE 1:\* +FLAGS \Deleted and EXPUNGE commands the files won't
be unnecessarily rename()d before being unlink()ed.
+ imap-proxy: Send backend's CAPABILITY if it's different from what
was sent to client before.
+ IMAP: struct mail now keeps track of all kinds of statistics, such
as number of open()s, stat()s, bytes read, etc. These fields could
be exported by some kind of a statistics plugin (not included yet).
+ IMAP: SEARCH command now dynamically figures out how to run about
0.20 .. 0.25 seconds before seeing if there's other work to do.
This makes the SEARCH performance much better.
- Fixes to shared mailbox handling.
- Fixes to virtual mailboxes.
- THREAD command could have crashed.
- Fixes to expire-tool.
- mbox: Don't break if From\_-line is preceded by CRLF (instead of LF).
- dict process wasn't restarted after SIGHUP was sent to master.
v1.2.rc3 2009-04-16 Timo Sirainen
\* IMAP proxy no longer simply forwards tagged reply from
remote authentication command. It's now done only if the remote
server sent a [resp-code], otherwise all failure strings are
converted to Dovecot's "Authentication failed." to make sure that
if remote isn't using Dovecot it won't reveal user's existence.
+ Quota roots can now specify which namespace's quota they're
tracking. This is probably the most useful for giving public
namespaces a quota.
+ Added imap\_idle\_notify\_interval setting.
- Fixes to shared mailbox handling
- Fixes to virtual mailboxes
- Fixed compiling with some FreeBSD and NetBSD versions
- THREAD REFS still might have returned one (0) at the beginning.
- deliver wasn't using mail\_access\_groups setting.
- Fixed some error handling in maildir and index code.
v1.2.rc2 2009-04-03 Timo Sirainen
- rquota.x file was missing from rc1 distribution, causing compiling
to fail.
v1.2.rc1 2009-04-03 Timo Sirainen
\* See v1.2.0 notes
v1.1.5 2008-10-22 Timo Sirainen
\* Dovecot prints an informational message about authentication problems
at startup. The message goes away after the first successful
authentication. This hopefully reduces the number of "Why doesn't
my authentication work?" questions.
+ Maildir/dbox: Try harder to assign unique UIDVALIDITY values to
mailboxes to avoid potential problems when recreating or renaming
mailboxes. The UIDVALIDITY is tracked using dovecot-uidvalidity\*
files in the mail root directory.
+ Many logging improvements
- In some conditions Dovecot could have stopped using existing cache
file and never used it again until it was deleted.
- pop3 + Maildir: Make sure virtual sizes are always written to
dovecot-uidlist. This way if the indexes are lost Dovecot will never
do a huge amount of work to recalculate them.
- mbox: Fixed listing mailboxes in namespaces with prefix beginning
with '~' or '/' (i.e. UW-IMAP compatibility namespaces didn't work).
- dict quota: Don't crash when recalculating quota (when quota warnings
enabled).
- Fixes to handling "out of disk space/quota" failures.
- Blocking passdbs/userdbs (e.g. PAM, MySQL) could have failed lookups
sometimes when auth\_worker\_max\_request\_count was non-zero.
- Fixed compiling with OpenBSD
v1.1.4 2008-10-05 Timo Sirainen
- SORT: Yet another assert-crashfix when renumbering index sort IDs.
- ACL plugin fixes: Negative rights were actually treated as positive
rights. 'k' right didn't prevent creating parent/child/child mailbox.
ACL groups weren't working.
- Maildir++ quota: Fixes to rebuilding when quota limit wasn't
specified in Dovecot (0 limit or limit read from maildirsize).
- mbox: Several bugfixes causing errors and crashes.
- Several fixes to expire plugin / expire-tool.
- lock\_method=dotlock could have deadlocked with itself.
- Many error handling fixes and log message improvements.
v1.1.3 2008-09-02 Timo Sirainen
\* mail\_max\_userip\_connections limit no longer applies to master user
logins.
+ login\_log\_format\_elements: Added %k to show SSL protocol/cipher
information. Not included by default.
+ imap/pop3-proxy: If auth\_verbose=yes, log proxy login failures.
+ deliver: Added -s parameter to autosubscribe to autocreated mailboxes.
- message parser fixes - hopefully fixes an infinite looping problem
- SORT: One more assert-crashfix when renumbering index sort IDs.
- mbox: Saving may have truncated the mail being saved
- mbox: Several other bugfixes
- mail\_full\_filesystem\_access=yes was broken when listing mailboxes
(it still is with maildir++ layout).
- maildirlock utility was somewhat broken
- zlib plugin: bzip2 support was somewhat broken
- NFS: Make sure writing to files via output streams don't
assert-crash when write() returns only partial success.
v1.1.2 2008-07-24 Timo Sirainen
+ Added full text search indexing support for Apache Lucene Solr
server: http://wiki.dovecot.org/Plugins/FTS/Solr
+ IMAP SORT: Added X-SCORE sort key for use with Solr searches.
+ zlib plugin supports now bzip2 also.
+ quota: All backends now take noenforcing parameter.
+ Maildir: Add ,S= to maildir filename whenever quota plugin
is loaded, even when not using Maildir++ quota.
+ deliver: Allow lda section to override plugin settings.
+ deliver: Giving a -m  parameter now silently saves
the mail to INBOX. This is useful for e.g. -m INBOX/${extension}
+ Added a new maildirlock utility for write-locking Dovecot Maildir.
+ dict-sql: Support non-MySQL databases by assuming they implement the
"INSERT .. ON DUPLICATE KEY" using an INSERT trigger.
- SORT: Fixed several crashes/errors with sort indexing.
- IMAP: BODYSTRUCTURE is finally RFC 3501 compliant. Earlier versions
didn't include Content-Location support.
- IMAP: Fixed bugs with listing INBOX.
- Maildir: maildirfolder file wasn't created when dovecot-shared
file existed on the root directory
- deliver didn't expand %variables in namespace location settings.
- zlib: Copying non-compressed messages resulted in empty mails
(except when hardlink-copying between maildirs).
- mbox-snarf plugin was somewhat broken
- deliver + Maildir: If uidlist couldn't be locked while saving,
we might have assert-crashed
- mbox: Fixed an assert-crash with \Recent flag handling
v1.1.1 2008-06-22 Timo Sirainen
- Maildir: When migrating from v1.0 with old format dovecot-uidlist
files, Dovecot may have appended lines to it using the new format and
later broken with "UID larger than next\_uid" error.
v1.1.0 2008-06-21 Timo Sirainen
No changes since v1.1.rc13. Below are the largest changes since v1.0:
\* After Dovecot v1.1 has modified index or dovecot-uidlist files,
they can't be opened anymore with Dovecot versions earlier than
v1.0.2.
\* See doc/wiki/Upgrading.1.1.txt (or for latest changes,
http://wiki.dovecot.org/Upgrading/1.1) for list of changes since
v1.0 that you should be aware of when upgrading.
+ IMAP: Added support for UIDPLUS and LIST-EXTENDED extensions.
+ IMAP SORT: Sort keys are indexed, which makes SORT commands faster.
+ When saving messages, update cache file immediately with the data
that we expect client to fetch later.
+ NFS caches are are flushed whenever needed. See mail\_nfs\_storage and
mail\_nfs\_index settings.
+ Out of order command execution (SEARCH, FETCH, LIST), nonstandard
command cancellation (X-CANCEL )
+ IMAP: STATUS-IN-LIST draft implementation
+ Expire plugin can be used to keep track of oldest messages in
specific mailboxes. A nightly run can then quickly expunge old
messages from the mailboxes that have them. The tracking is done
using lib-dict, so you can use either Berkeley DB or SQL database.
+ Namespaces are supported everywhere now.
+ Namespaces have new list and subscriptions settings.
+ Full text search indexing support with Lucene and Squat backends.
+ OTP and S/KEY authentication mechanisms (by Andrey Panin).
+ mbox and Maildir works with both Maildir++ and FS layouts. You can
change these by appending :LAYOUT=maildir++ or :LAYOUT=fs to
mail\_location.
+ LDAP: Support templates in pass\_attrs and user\_attrs
+ Support for listening in multiple IPs/ports.
+ Quota plugin rewrite: Support for multiple quota roots, warnings,
allow giving storage size in bytes or kilo/mega/giga/terabytes,
per-mailbox quota rules.
+ Filesystem quota backend supports inode limits, group quota and
RPC quota for NFS.
+ SEARCH and SORT finally compare non-ASCII characters
case-insensitively. We use i;unicode-casemap algorithm.
+ Config files support splitting values to multiple lines with \
v1.1.rc13 2008-06-20 Timo Sirainen
- mbox: Fixed a crash when adding a new X-IMAPbase: header with
keywords.
- Message parser: Fixed assert-crash if cached MIME structure was
broken.
- Squat: Potential crashfix with mmap\_disable=yes.
v1.1.rc12 2008-06-19 Timo Sirainen
- mbox: Don't give "Can't find next message offset" warnings when
plugin (e.g. quota) accesses the message being saved.
- deliver: Settings inside protocol imap {} weren't ignored.
v1.1.rc11 2008-06-19 Timo Sirainen
- dovecot-uidlist is now recreated if it results in file shrinking
over 25%.
- Some other minor fixes
v1.1.rc10 2008-06-13 Timo Sirainen
\* LIST X-STATUS renamed to LIST STATUS and fixed its behavior with
LIST-EXTENDED options. It's now compatible with STATUS-IN-LIST
draft 00.
- Message parsing could have sometimes produced incorrect results,
corrupting BODY/BODYSTRUCTURE replies and perhaps others.
- SORT: Fixed several bugs
- FreeBSD 7.0: Environment clearing wasn't working correctly.
This caused "environment corrupted" problems at least with deliver
trying to call sendmail and running Dovecot from inetd.
- HP-UX: Several fixes to get it to work (by Christian Corti)
- Fixes to using expire plugin with SQL dictionary.
- dbox fixes
v1.1.rc9 2008-06-09 Timo Sirainen
+ Maildir: When hardlink-copying a file, copy the W= in the
filename if it exists in the original filename.
- mbox: With rc8 empty lines were inserted in the middle of saved
mails' headers.
- maildir: Fixed problems with opening newly saved messages which we
saw in index file but couldn't see in dovecot-uidlist. Happened only
when messages weren't saved via Dovecot (deliver or IMAP).
- Several bugfixes to handling sort indexes
- deliver: Boolean settings that were supposed to default to "yes" were
set to "no" unless explicitly defined in dovecot.conf:
dotlock\_use\_excl, maildir\_copy\_with\_hardlinks, mbox\_dirty\_syncs,
mbox\_lazy\_writes.
v1.1.rc8 2008-06-03 Timo Sirainen
+ deliver: Added -p parameter to provide path to delivered mail.
This allows maildir to save identical mails to multiple recipients
using hard links.
- rc6/rc7 broke POP3 with non-Maildir formats
- mbox: Saving a message without a body or the end-of-headers line
could have caused an assert-crash later.
- Several dbox fixes
v1.1.rc7 2008-05-30 Timo Sirainen
- Fixed compiling problems with non-Linux OSes
v1.1.rc6 2008-05-30 Timo Sirainen
\* Index file format changed a bit. If an older Dovecot v1.1 reads
index files updated by rc6+, they may give "Invalid header record
size" or "ext reset: invalid record size" warnings. v1.0 won't give
these errors.
\* IMAP: LIST .. RETURN (X-STATUS) command return now LIST entries
before STATUS entries.
\* zlib plugin: Uncompress if the message begins with zlib header
instead of looking at the 'Z' flag. This fixes copying with hard
links. Based on a patch by Richard Platel.
+ IMAP: SORT index handling code was half-rewritten to fix several bugs
when multiple sessions were sorting at the same time. The new code is
hopefully also faster.
+ Maildir: If POP3 UIDL extra field is found from dovecot-uidlist,
it's used instead of the default UIDL format (or X-UIDL: header).
This allows easily preserving UIDLs when migrating from other POP3
servers. Patch by Nicholas Von Hollen @ Mailtrust.
+ Maildir: ,W= is now always added to maildir filenames
+ deliver: Avoid reading dovecot-uidlist's contents if possible.
+ Added %T modifier = Trim whitespace from end of string
- IMAP: Fixed some bugs in LIST-EXTENDED implementation.
- IMAP: If client tries to change the selected mailbox state while
another command is still running, wait until the command is finished.
This fixes some crashes and other unwanted behavior.
- allow\_nets userdb setting was broken with big endian CPUs
v1.1.rc5 2008-05-05 Timo Sirainen
+ Support cross-realm Kerberos 5 authentication. Based on patch by
Zachary Kotlarek.
+ Added dict\_db\_config setting to point to a Berkeley DB config file.
+ If mail\_chroot ends with "/.", remove chroot prefix from home
directory.
- Fixed several bugs and memory leaks in ACL plugin. LIST and LSUB
may have listed mailboxes where user had no 'l' access. STORE could
have been used to update any flags without appropriate access.
- mbox: Valid-looking From\_-lines in message bodies caused the message
to be split to two messages (broken since v1.0).
- Plugin initialization hooks were called in wrong order, possibly
causing problems when multiple plugins were used at the same time.
- Expire plugin was broken
- LIST-EXTENDED options were ignored.
- LDAP: Static attribute names weren't working correctly
- deliver: mail\_uid and mail\_gid settings weren't used.
- pop3 + maildir++ quota: maildirsize file wasn't created if it
didn't exist already.
- dnotify: Waiting for dotlock to be deleted used 100% CPU
v1.1.rc4 2008-04-01 Timo Sirainen
\* Fixed two buffer overflows in str\_find\_init(). It was used by
SEARCH code when searching for headers or message body. Added code
to catch these kind of overflows when compiling with --enable-debug.
Found by Diego Liziero.
+ LDAP: Added debug\_level and ldaprc\_path settings (OpenLDAP-only)
+ Squat: Added fts\_squat = partial=n full=m settings. See the wiki.
- dbox metadata updating fixes.
- quota: backend=n didn't work
- SEARCH RECENT may have returned non-recent messages if index files
were created by v1.0.
- If mailbox was opened as read-only with EXAMINE, STOREs were
permanently saved.
- LDAP: Templates were somewhat broken (by richs at whidbey.net)
v1.1.rc3 2008-03-09 Timo Sirainen
\* Fixed a security hole in blocking passdbs (MySQL always. PAM, passwd
and shadow if blocking=yes) where user could specify extra fields
in the password. The main problem here is when specifying
"skip\_password\_check" introduced in v1.0.11 for fixing master user
logins, allowing the user to log in as anyone without a valid
password.
- mail\_privileged\_group was broken in some systems (OS X, Solaris?)
v1.1.rc2 2008-03-08 Timo Sirainen
\* mail\_extra\_groups setting was commonly used insecurely. This setting
is now deprecated. Most users should switch to using
mail\_privileged\_group setting, but if you really need the old
functionality use mail\_access\_groups instead.
+ Expire plugin now supports wildcards in mailbox names.
+ dbox: Expire plugin supports moving old mails to alternative
dbox directory
+ Maildir++ quota: quota\_rule=?: specifies a default rule
which is used only if the maildirsize file doesn't exist.
+ If SSL/TLS connection isn't closed cleanly, log the last error
in the disconnection line.
+ EXPUNGE: If new \Deleted messages were found while expunging,
do it again and expunge them as well (Outlook workaround)
- IMAP: SEARCH, LIST and THREAD command correctness fixes
- Maildir++ quota: Quota rules and warnings with % rules didn't work
if the default limits were taken from maildirsize file.
- Maildir++ quota: If both byte and message limits weren't specified,
maildirsize file was recalculated all the time
- mbox: Flag and keyword updates may have gotten lost in some
situations (happens with v1.0 too)
- ldap: Don't crash if userdb lookup fails
- Squat fixes and performance improvements
v1.1.rc1 2008-02-21 Timo Sirainen
\* See v1.1.0 notes
v1.0.10 2007-12-29 Timo Sirainen
\* Security hole with LDAP+auth cache: If base setting contained
%variables they weren't included in auth cache key, which broke
caching. This could have caused different users with same passwords
to log in as each other.
- LDAP: Fixed potential infinite looping when connection to LDAP
server was lost and there were queued requests.
- mbox: More changes to fix problems caused by v1.0.8 and v1.0.9.
- Maildir: Fixed a UIDLIST\_IS\_LOCKED() assert-crash in some conditions
(caused by changes in v1.0.9)
- If protocols=none, don't require imap executables to exist
v1.0.9 2007-12-11 Timo Sirainen
+ Maildir: Don't wait on dovecot-uidlist.lock when we just want to
find out a new filename for the message.
- mbox: v1.0.8 changes sometimes caused FETCH to fail with
"got too little data", disconnecting the client.
- Fixed a memory leak when FETCHing message header/body multiple
times within a command (e.g. BODY[1] BODY[2])
- IMAP: Partial body fetching was still slow with mboxes
v1.0.8 2007-11-28 Timo Sirainen
+ Authentication: Added "password\_noscheme" field that can be used
instead of "password". "password" treats "{prefix}" as a password
scheme while "password\_noscheme" treats it as part of the password
itself. So "password\_noscheme" should be used if you're storing
passwords as plaintext. Non-plaintext passwords never begin
with "{", so this isn't a problem with them.
- IMAP: Partial body fetching was sometimes non-optimal, causing
the entire message to be read for every FETCH command.
- deliver failed to save the message when envelope sender address
contained spaces.
- Maildir++ quota: We could have randomly recalculated quota when
it wasn't necessary.
- Login process could have crashed after logging in if client sent
data before "OK Logged in" reply was sent (i.e. before master had
replied that login succeeded).
- Don't assert-crash when reading dovecot.index.logs generated by
Dovecot v1.1.
- Authentication: Don't assert-crash if password beings with "{" but
doesn't contain "}".
- Authentication cache didn't work when using settings that changed
the username (e.g. auth\_username\_format).
v1.0.7 2007-10-29 Timo Sirainen
- deliver: v1.0.6's "From " line ignoring could have written to a
bad location in stack, possibly causing problems.
v1.0.6 2007-10-28 Timo Sirainen
\* IDLE: Interval between mailbox change notifies is now 1 second,
because some clients keep a long-running IDLE connection and use
other connections to actually read the mails.
\* SORT: If Date: header is missing or broken, fallback to using
INTERNALDATE (as the SORT draft nowadays specifies).
+ deliver: If message begins with a "From " line, ignore it.
+ zlib plugin: If maildir file has a "Z" flag, open it with zlib.
- CREATE: Don't assert-crash if trying to create namespace prefix.
- SEARCH: Fixes to handling NOT operator with sequence ranges.
- LDAP reconnection fixes
- Maildir: Don't break when renaming mailboxes with '\*' or '%'
characters and children.
- mbox: Fixed "file size unexpectedly shrinked" error in some
conditions.
- quota+mbox: Don't fail if trying to delete a directory.
- Fixes to running from inetd
v1.0.5 2007-09-09 Timo Sirainen
- deliver: v1.0.4 broke home directory handling
- maildir: Creating mailboxes didn't use dovecot-shared's group for
cur/new/tmp directories.
v1.0.4 2007-09-08 Timo Sirainen
\* Assume a MIME message if Content-Type: header exists, even if
Mime-Version: header doesn't.
- IMAP: CREATE ns\_prefix/box/ didn't work right when namespace prefix
existed.
- deliver: plugin {} settings were overriding settings from userdb.
- mbox: Expunging the first message might not have worked always
- PostgreSQL: If we can't connect to server, timeout queries after
a while instead of trying forever.
- Solaris: sendfile() support was broken and could have caused
100% CPU usage and the connection hanging.
v1.0.3 2007-08-01 Timo Sirainen
- deliver: v1.0.2's bounce fix caused message to be always saved to
INBOX even if Sieve script had discard, reject or redirect commands.
- LDAP: auth\_bind=yes and empty auth\_bind\_userdn leaked memory
- ACL plugin: If user was given i (insert) right for a mailbox, but
not all s/t/w (seen, deleted, other flags) rights, COPY and APPEND
commands weren't supposed to allow saving those flags. This is
technically a security fix, but it's unlikely this caused problems
for anyone.
- ACL plugin: i (insert) right didn't work unless user was also given
l (lookup) right.
- Solaris: Fixed filesystem quota for autofs mounts.
v1.0.2 2007-07-15 Timo Sirainen
\* dbox isn't built anymore by default. It will be redesigned so it
shouldn't be used.
+ Maildir: Support reading dovecot-uidlist (v3) files created by
Dovecot v1.1.
- Maildir: "UIDVALIDITY changed" errors could happen with newly
created mailboxes
- If "INBOX." namespace was used, LIST returned it with \HasNoChildren
which caused some clients not to show any other mailboxes.
- Maildir++ quota: If multiple processes were updating maildirsize
at the same time, we failed with "Unknown error".
- IMAP: IDLE didn't actually disconnect client after 30 minutes of
inactivity.
- LDAP passdb/userdb was leaking memory
- deliver: %variables in plugin {} weren't expanded
- deliver: Don't bounce the mail if Sieve plugin returns failure
v1.0.1 2007-06-15 Timo Sirainen
\* deliver: If Return-Path doesn't contain user and domain, don't try
to bounce the mail (this is how it was supposed to work earlier too)
\* deliver: %variables in mail setting coming from userdb aren't
expanded anymore (again how it should have worked). The expansion
could have caused problems if paths contained any '%' characters.
+ Print Dovecot version number with dovecot -n and -a
+ deliver: Added -e parameter to write rejection error to stderr and
exit with EX\_NOPERM instead of sending the rejection by executing
sendmail.
+ dovecot --log-error logs now a warning, an error and a fatal
- Trying to start Dovecot while it's already running doesn't anymore
wipe out login\_dir and break the running Dovecot.
- maildir: Fixed "UID larger than next\_uid" errors which happened
sometimes when dovecot-uidlist file didn't exist but index files did
(usually because mailbox didn't have any messages when it was
selected for the first time)
- maildir: We violated maildir spec a bit by not having keyword
characters sorted in the filename.
- maildir: If we don't have write access to cur/ directory, treat the
mailbox as read-only. This fixes some internal error problems with
trying to use read-only maildirs.
- maildir: Deleting a symlinked maildir failed with internal error.
- mbox: pop3\_uidl\_format=%m wasn't working right
- mbox: If non-filesystem quota was enabled, we could have failed
with "Unexpectedly lost From-line" errors while saving new messages
- mysql auth: %c didn't work. Patch by Andrey Panin
- APPEND / SEARCH: If internaldate was outside valid value for time\_t,
we returned BAD error for APPEND and SEARCH never matched. With 64bit
systems this shouldn't have happened. With 32bit systems the valid
range is usually for years 1902..2037.
- COPY: We sent "Hang in there.." too early sometimes and checked it
too often (didn't break anything, but was slower than needed).
- deliver: Postfix's sendmail binary wasn't working with mail\_debug=yes
- Don't corrupt ssl-parameters.dat files when running multiple Dovecot
instances.
- Cache compression caused dovecot.index.cache to be completely deleted
with big endian CPUs if 64bit file offsets were used (default)
- Fixed "(index\_mail\_parse\_header): assertion failed" crash
v1.0.0 2007-04-13 Timo Sirainen
+ Documentation updated.
v1.0.rc32 2007-04-12 Timo Sirainen
- LDAP, auth\_bind=no: Don't crash if doing non-plaintext ldap passdb
lookup for unknown user. This also broke deliver when userdb static
was used.
- LDAP, auth\_bind=yes and userdb ldap: We didn't wait until bind was
finished before sending the userdb request, which could have caused
problems.
- LDAP: Don't break when compiling with OpenLDAP v2.3 library
- Convert plugin: Don't create "maildirfolder" file to Maildir root.
v1.0.rc31 2007-04-08 Timo Sirainen
- mbox: Give "mbox file was modified while we were syncing" error only
if we detect some problems in the mbox file. The check can't be
trusted with NFS.
- Convert plugin: If directory for destination storage doesn't exist,
create it.
- Convert plugin: Mailbox names weren't converted in subscription list.
v1.0.rc30 2007-04-06 Timo Sirainen
\* PAM: Lowercase the PAM service name when calling with "args = \*".
Linux PAM did this internally already, but at least BSD didn't.
If your PAM file used to be in /etc/pam.d/IMAP or POP3 file you'll
need to lowercase it now.
+ Send list of CA names to client when using
ssl\_verify\_client\_cert=yes.
- IMAP: If message body started with line feed, it wasn't counted
in BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE replies' line count field.
- deliver didn't load plugins before chrooting
v1.0.rc29 2007-03-28 Timo Sirainen
\* Security fix: If zlib plugin was loaded, it was possible to open
gzipped mbox files outside the user's mail directory.
+ Added auth\_gssapi\_hostname setting.
- IMAP: LIST "" "" didn't return anything if there didn't exist a
namespace with empty prefix. This broke some clients.
- If Dovecot is tried to be started when it's already running, don't
delete existing auth sockets and break the running Dovecot
- If deliver failed too early it still returned exit code 89 instead
of EX\_TEMPFAIL.
- deliver: INBOX fallbacking with -n parameter wasn't working.
- passdb passwd and shadow couldn't be used as master or deny databases
- IDLE: inotify didn't notice changes in mbox file
- If index file directory couldn't be created, disable indexes instead
of failing to open the mailbox.
- rawlog wasn't working with chrooting
- Several other minor fixes
v1.0.rc28 2007-03-23 Timo Sirainen
\* deliver + userdb static: Verify the user's existence from passdb,
unless allow\_all\_users=yes
\* dovecot --exec-mail: Log to configured log files instead of stderr
\* Added "-example" part to doc/dovecot-sql-example.conf and
doc/dovecot-ldap-example.conf. They are now also installed to
$sysconfdir with "make install".
+ When copying/syncing a lot of mails, send "\* OK Hang in there"
replies to client every 15 seconds so it doesn't just timeout the
connection.
+ Added idxview and logview utilities to examine Dovecot's index files
+ passdb passwd and shadow support blocking=yes setting now also
+ mbox: If mbox file changes unexpectedly while we're writing to it,
log an error.
+ deliver: Ignore -m "" parameter to make calling it easier.
+ deliver: Added new -n parameter to disable autocreating mailboxes.
It affects both -m parameter and Sieve plugin's fileinto action
- mbox: Using ~/ in the mail root directory caused a ~ directory to be
created (instead of expanding it to home directory)
- auth cache: If unknown user was found from cache, we didn't properly
return "unknown user" status, which could have caused problems in
deliver.
- mbox: Fixed "UID inserted in the middle of mailbox" in some
conditions with broken X-UID headers
- Index view syncing fixes
- rc27 didn't compile with some non-GCC compilers
- vpopmail support didn't compile in rc27
- NFS check with chrooting broke home direcotry for the first login
- deliver: If user lookup returned "unknown user", it logged
"BUG: Unexpected input"
- convert plugin didn't convert INBOX
v1.0.rc27 2007-03-13 Timo Sirainen
+ mbox and index file code handles silently out of quota/disk
space errors (maildir still has problems). They will give the user
a "Not enough disk space" error instead of flooding the log file.
+ Added fsync\_disable setting.
+ mail-log plugin: Log the mailbox name, except if it's INBOX
+ dovecot-auth: Added a lot more debug logging to passdbs and userdbs
+ dovecot-auth: Added %c variable which expands to "secured" with
SSL/TLS/localhost.
+ dovecot-auth: Added %m variable which expands to auth mechanism name
- maildir++ quota: With ignore=box setting the quota was still updated
for the mailbox even though it was allowed to go over quota (but
quota recalculation ignored the box).
- Index file handling fixes
- mbox syncing fixes
- Wrong endianess index files still weren't silently rebuilt
- IMAP quota plugin: GETQUOTAROOT returned the mailbox name wrong the
namespace had a prefix or if its separator was non-default
- IMAP: If client was appending multiple messages with MULTIAPPEND
and LITERAL+ extensions and one of the appends failed, Dovecot
treated the rest of the mail data as IMAP commands.
- If mail was sent to client with sendfile() call, we could have
hanged the connection. This could happen only if mails were saved
with CR+LF linefeeds.
v1.0.rc26 2007-03-07 Timo Sirainen
\* Changed --with-headers to --enable-header-install
\* If time moves backwards only max. 5 seconds, sleep until we're back
in the original present instead of killing ourself. An error is
still logged.
- IMAP: With namespace prefixes LSUB prefix.\* listed INBOX.INBOX.
- deliver: Ignore mbox metadata headers from the message input.
X-IMAP header crashed deliver.
- deliver: If mail\_debug=yes, drop out DEBUG environment before
calling sendmail binary. Postfix's sendmail didn't really like it.
- mbox: X-UID brokeness fixes broke rc25 even with valid X-UID headers.
Now the code should finally work right.
- Maildir: When syncing a huge maildir, touch dovecot-uidlist.lock file
once in a while to make sure it doesn't get overwritten by another
process.
- Maildir++ quota: We didn't handle NUL bytes in maildirsize files very
well. Now the file is rebuilt when they're seen (NFS problem).
- Index/view handling fix should fix some crashes/errors
- If index files were moved to a different endianess machine, Dovecot
logged all sorts of errors instead of silently rebuilding them.
- Convert plugin didn't change hierarchy separators in mailbox names.
- PostgreSQL authentication could have lost requests once in a while
with a heavily loaded server.
- Login processes could have crashed in some situations
- auth cache crashed with non-plaintext mechanisms
v1.0.rc25 2007-03-01 Timo Sirainen
\* If time moves backwards, Dovecot kills itself instead of giving
random problems.
+ Added --with-headers configure option to install .h files.
Binary package builders could use this to create some dovecot-dev
package to make compiling plugins easier.
- PLAIN authentication: Don't crash dovecot-auth with invalid input.
- IMAP APPEND: Don't crash if saving fails
- IMAP LIST: If prefix.INBOX has children and we're listing under
prefix.%, don't drop the prefix.
- mbox: Broken X-UID headers still weren't handled correctly.
- mail-log plugin: Fixed deleted/undeleted logging.
v1.0.rc24 2007-02-22 Timo Sirainen
\* Dovecot now fails to load plugins that were compiled for different
Dovecot version, unless version\_ignore=yes is set. This needs to be
explicitly set in plugins, so out-of-tree plugins won't have this
check by default.
- pop3\_lock\_session=yes could cause deadlocks, and with maildir the
uidlist lock could have been overridden after 2 minutes causing
problems
- PAM wasted CPU by calling a timeout function 1000x too often
- Trash plugin was more or less broken with multiple namespaces and
with multiple trash mailboxes
v1.0.rc23 2007-02-20 Timo Sirainen
\* deliver doesn't ever exit with Dovecot's internal exit codes anymore.
All its internal exit codes are changed to EX\_TEMPFAIL.
\* mbox: X-Delivery-ID header is now dropped when saving mails.
\* mbox: If pop3\_uidl\_format=%m, we generate a unique X-Delivery-ID
header when saving mails to make sure the UIDL is unique.
+ PAM: blocking=yes in args uses an alternative way to do PAM checks.
Try it if you're having problems with PAM.
+ userdb passwd: blocking=yes in args makes the userdb lookups be done
in auth worker processes. Set it if you're doing remote NSS lookups
(eg. nss\_ldap problems are fixed by this).
+ If PAM child process hasn't responded in two minutes, send KILL
signal to it (only with blocking=no)
- IMAP: APPEND ate all CPU while waiting for more data from the client
(broken in rc22)
- mbox: Broken X-UID headers assert-crashed sometimes
- mbox: When saving a message to an empty mbox file it got an UID
which immediately got incremented.
- mbox: Fixed some wrong "uid-last unexpectedly lost" errors.
- auth cache: In some situations we crashed if passdb had extra\_fields.
- auth cache: Special extra\_fields weren't saved to auth cache.
For example allow\_nets restrictions were ignored for cached entries.
- A lot of initial login processes could cause auth socket errors
in log file at startup, if dovecot-auth started slowly. Now the
login processes are started only after dovecot-auth has finished
initializing itself.
- imap/pop3 proxy: Don't crash if the remote server disconnects before
we're logged in.
- deliver: Don't bother trying to save the mail twice into the default
mailbox (eg. if it's over quota).
- mmap\_disable=yes + non-Linux was really slow with large
dovecot.index.cache files
- MySQL couldn't be used as a masterdb
- Trash plugin was more or less broken
- imap/pop3 couldn't load plugins if they chrooted
- imap/pop3-login process could crash in some conditions
- checkpassword-reply crashed if USER/HOME wasn't set
v1.0.rc22 2007-02-06 Timo Sirainen
+ pop3: Commit the transaction even if client didn't QUIT so cached
data gets saved.
- Fixed another indexing bug in rc19 and later which caused
transactions to be skipped in some situations, causing all kinds of
problems.
- mail\_log\_max\_lines\_per\_sec was a bit broken and caused crashes with
dovecot -a
- BSD filesystem quota was counted wrong. Patch by Manuel Bouyer
- LIST: If namespace has a prefix and inbox=no, don't list
prefix.inbox if it happens to exist when listing for %.
v1.0.rc21 2007-02-02 Timo Sirainen
- Cache file handling could have crashed rc20
v1.0.rc20 2007-02-02 Timo Sirainen
+ dovecot: Added --log-error command line option to log an error, so
the error log is easily found.
+ Added mail\_log\_max\_lines\_per\_sec setting. Change it to avoid log
throttling with mail\_log plugin.
- Changing message flags was more or less broken in rc19
- ACL plugin still didn't work without separate control directory
- Some mbox handling fixes, including fixing an infinite loop
- Some index file handling fixes
- maildir quota: Fixed a file descriptor leak
- If auth\_cache was enabled and userdb returned "user unknown"
(typically only deliver can do that), dovecot-auth crashed.
- mail\_log plugin didn't work with pop3
v1.0.rc19 2007-01-23 Timo Sirainen
- ACL plugin didn't work unless control dir was separate from maildir
- More index file handling fixes
v1.0.rc18 2007-01-22 Timo Sirainen
\* ACL plugin + Maildir: Moved dovecot-acl file from control directory
to maildir. To prevent accidents caused by this change, Dovecot
kills itself if it finds dovecot-acl file from the control directory.
\* When opening a maildir, check if tmp/'s atime is over 8h old. If it
is, delete files in it with ctime older than 36h. However if
atime - ctime > 36h, it means that there's nothing to be deleted and
the scanning isn't done. We update atime ourself if filesystem is
mounted with noatime.
\* base\_dir doesn't need to be group-readable, don't force it.
\* mail\_read\_mmaped setting is deprecated and possibly broken. It's now
removed from dovecot-example.conf, but it still works for now.
\* Removed also umask setting from dovecot-example.conf since currently
it doesn't do what it's supposed to.
+ Authentication cache caches now also userdb data.
+ Added mail\_log plugin to log various mail operations. Currently it
logs mail copies, deletions, expunges and mailbox deletions.
- dict quota: messages=n parameter actually changed storage limit.
- A lot of fixes to handling index files. This should fix almost all
of the problems ever reported.
- LDAP: auth\_bind=yes was more or less broken.
- Saved mails and dovecot-keywords file didn't set the group from
dovecot-shared file.
- Fixed potential assert-crash while searching messages
- Fixed some crashes with invalid X-UID headers in mboxes
- If you didn't have a namespace with empty prefix, giving STATUS
command for a non-existing namespace caused the connection to give
"NO Unknown namespace" errors for all the future commands.
v1.0.rc17 2007-01-07 Timo Sirainen
- MySQL authentication caused username to show up as "OK" in rc16.
v1.0.rc16 2007-01-05 Timo Sirainen
\* IMAP: When trying to fetch an already expunged message, Dovecot used
to just disconnect client. Now it instead replies with dummy NIL
data.
\* Priority numbers in plugin names have changed. If you're installing
from source, you should delete the existing plugin files before
installing the new ones, otherwise you'll get errors.
\* Maildir: We're using rename() to move files from tmp/ to new/ now.
See http://wiki.dovecot.org/MailboxFormat/Maildir -> "Issues with
the specification" for reasoning why this is safe. This makes saving
mails faster, and also makes Dovecot usable with Mac OS X's HFS+
(after you also set dotlock\_use\_excl=yes, see below).
+ Added dotlock\_use\_excl setting. If enabled, dotlocks are created
directly using O\_EXCL flag, instead of by creating a temporary file
which is hardlinked. O\_EXCL is faster, but may not work with NFS.
+ If Dovecot crashes with Linux or Solaris, it'll log a
"Raw backtrace". It's worse than gdb's backtrace, but better than
nothing.
+ Added maildir\_copy\_preserve\_filename=yes setting.
+ Added a lazy-expunge plugin to allow users to unexpunge their mails.
+ maildir quota: Added ignore setting to maildir quota, which allows
ignoring quota in Trash mailbox.
+ dict quota: If dictionary doesn't yet contain the quota, calculate
it by going through all the mails in all the mailboxes.
+ login\_log\_format\_elements: Added %a=local port and %b=remote port
+ Added -i and -o options to rawlog to restrict logging only to
input or output.
- Doing a STATUS command for a selected mailbox (not a recommended
IMAP client behavior) caused Dovecot to sync the mailbox silently.
This could have lost eg. EXPUNGE events from clients, causing them
to use wrong sequence numbers.
- deliver was treating boolean settings set to "no" as if they were
"yes" (they were supposed to be commented out for "no")
- Running "dovecot" with -a or -n option while Dovecot was running
deleted all authentication sockets, which caused all the future
logins to fail.
- maildir: RENAME and DELETE didn't touch control directory if it was
different from maildir or index dir.
- We treated internal userdb lookup errors as "user unknown" errors.
In such situations this caused deliver to think the user didn't
exist and the mail get bounced.
- pam: Setting cache\_key crashed
- shared maildir: dovecot-keywords file's mode wasn't taken from
dovecot-shared file.
- dovecotpw wasn't working with PowerPC
v1.0.rc15 2006-11-19 Timo Sirainen
\* Fixed an off-by-one buffer overflow in cache file handling. The
code is executed only with mmap\_disable=yes and only if index files
are used (ie. INDEX=MEMORY is safe).
\* passdb checkpassword: Handle vpopmail's non-standard exit codes.
- rc14 sometimes assert-crashed if .log.2 file existed in a mailbox
(earlier versions leaked memory and file descriptors)
- io\_add() assert-crashfixes
- Potential SSL hang fix at the beginning of the connection
v1.0.rc14 2006-11-12 Timo Sirainen
\* LDAP: Don't try to use ldap\_bind() with empty passwords, since
Windows 2003 AD skips password checking with them and just returns
success.
\* verbose\_ssl=yes: Don't bother logging "syscall failed: EOF"
messages. No-one cares about them.
+ Dovecot sources should now compile without any warnings with gcc 3.2+
- rc13 crashed if client disconnected while IDLEing
- LDAP: auth\_bind=yes fixes
- %variables: Fixed zero padding handling and documented it. %0.1n
shouldn't enable it, and it really shouldn't stay for the next
%variable. -sign also shouldn't stay for the next variable.
- Don't leak opened .log.2 transaction logs.
- Fixed a potential hang in IDLE command (probably really rare).
- Fixed potential problems with client disconnecting while master was
handling the login.
- quota plugin didn't work in Mac OS X
v1.0.rc13 2006-11-08 Timo Sirainen
+ deliver: If we're executing as a normal system user, get the HOME
environment from passwd if it's not set. This makes it possible to
run deliver from .forward.
- Older compilers caused LDAP authentication to crash
- Dying LDAP connections weren't handled exactly correctly in rc11,
although it seemed to work usually
- Fixed crashes and memory leaks with AUTHENTICATE command
- Fixed crashes and leaks with IMAP/POP3 proxying
- maildir: Changing a mailbox while another process was saving a
message there at the same may have caused the changes to not be made
into the maildir, which could have caused other problems later..
v1.0.rc12 2006-11-05 Timo Sirainen
- rc11 didn't compile with some compilers
- default\_mail\_env fallbacking was broken with --exec-mail
v1.0.rc11 2006-11-05 Timo Sirainen
\* Renamed default\_mail\_env to mail\_location. default\_mail\_env still
works for backwards compatibility.
\* deliver: When sending rejects, don't include Content-Type in the
rejected mail's headers.
\* LDAP changes:
\* If auth binds are used, bind back to the default dn before doing
a search. Otherwise it could fail if a user gave an invalid
password.
\* Initial binding at connect is now done asynchronously.
\* Use pass\_attrs even with auth\_bind=yes since it may contain
useful non-password fields.
+ passdb checkpassword: Give TCPLOCALIP and TCPREMOTEIP and PROTO=TCP
environments to the checkpassword binary so we're UCSPI (and vchkpw)
compatible.
- mbox handling was a bit broken in rc10
- Using Dovecot via inetd kept crashing dovecot master
- deliver: Don't crash with -f "". Changed the default from envelope
to be "MAILER-DAEMON".
- INBOX wasn't shown with LSUB command if only prefixed namespaces
were used.
- passdb ldap: Reconnecting to LDAP server wasn't working with
auth binds.
- passdb sql: Non-plaintext authentication didn't work
- MySQL passdb ignored all non-password checks, such as allow\_nets
- trash plugin was broken
v1.0.rc10 2006-10-16 Timo Sirainen
\* When matching allowed\_nets IPs, convert IPv6-mapped-IPv4 addresses
to actual IPv4 addresses first.
+ IMAP: Try to avoid sending duplicate/useless message flag updates
+ Added support for non-plaintext authentication for vpopmail if it
returns plaintext passwords. Based on patch by Remi Gacogne.
+ Added %D modified to return "sub.domain.org" as
"sub,dc=domain,dc=org" (for LDAP queries). Patch by Andrey Panin.
- rc9 broke cache files in 64bit systems
- deliver works now with mail\_chroot
- auth cache didn't work properly with multiple passdbs
- Fixes to handling CRLF linefeeds in mboxes.
v1.0.rc9 2006-10-14 Timo Sirainen
\* 64bit systems: dovecot.index.cache file will be rebuilt because
some time fields have been changed from 64bit fields to 32bit
fields. Now the same cache file can be used in both 32bit and
64bit systems without it being rebuilt.
\* Added libmysqlclient workaround to conflicting sha1\_result symbol,
which caused Dovecot to fail logging into MySQL.
+ dovecot.index.cache file opening is delayed until it's actually
needed. This reduces disk accesses a bit with eg. STATUS commands.
+ auth\_cache: Try to handle changing passwords automatically: If
password verification fails, but the last one had succeeded, don't
use the cache. This works only with plaintext auth.
- dovecot.index.cache: We didn't properly detect if some fields were
different length than we expected, which caused assert crashes
- Lots of fixes to login/master process handling
- mbox: Fixed a bug causing "X-IMAPbase uid-last unexpectedly lost
in mbox file" errors, and possibly others.
v1.0.rc8 2006-10-09 Timo Sirainen
\* GSSAPI: Changed POP3 service name to "pop", which is what the
standard says
\* "mbox:/var/mail/%u" no longer works as the mail location. You'll
have to specify the mail root explicitly, just like the examples
always have: "mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u"
+ SHA1, LDAP-MD5, PLAIN-MD5, PLAIN-MD4: The password can be now either
hex or base64 encoded. The encoding is detected automatically based
on the password string length.
+ Allow running only Dovecot master and dovecot-auth processes with
protocols=none setting
+ deliver: -f  parameter can be used to set mbox
From\_-line's sender address
+ deliver: Log all mail saves and failures
+ Tru64 SIA passdb support. Patch by Simon L Jackson.
- INBOX was listed twice in mailbox list if namespace prefix was used
- INBOX-prefixed namespaces were a bit broken
- kqueue: Fix 100% CPU usage
- deliver: Duplicate storage was a bit broken
- dictionary code was broken (ie. dict quota)
- SIGHUP caused crashes sometimes
v1.0.rc7 2006-08-18 Timo Sirainen
\* Require that Dovecot master process's version number matches the
child process's, unless version\_ignore=yes. Usually it's an
accidental installation problem if the version numbers don't match.
\* Maildir: Create maildirfolder file when creating new maildirs.
+ ldap+prefetch: Use global uid/gid settings if LDAP query doesn't
return them
+ %variables: Negative offsets count from the end of the string.
Patch by Johannes Berg.
- kqueue ioloop code rewrite
- notify=kqueue might have caused connection hangs sometimes
- deliver: If message body contained a valid mbox From\_ line, it
and the rest of the message was skipped.
- mbox: We got into infinite loops if trying to open a 2 byte sized
file as mbox.
- Don't crash with ssl\_disable=yes
- quota plugin caused compiling problems with some OSes
- mbox: After saving a mail to a synced mbox, we lost the sync which
caused worse performance
v1.0.rc6 2006-08-07 Timo Sirainen
\* Removed login\_max\_logging\_users setting since it was somewhat weird
in how it worked. Added login\_max\_connections to replace it with
login\_process\_per\_connection=no, and with =yes its functionality
is now within login\_max\_processes\_count.
+ Added --with-linux-quota configure option to specify which Linux
quota version to use, in case it's not correct in sys/quota.h.
Usually used as --with-linux-quota=2
+ acl plugins: If .DEFAULT file exists in global ACL root directory,
use it as the default ACLs for all mailboxes.
- Fixes to login process handling, especially with
login\_process\_per\_connection=no.
- Back to the original SSL proxy code but with one small fix, which
hopefully fixes the occational hangs with it
- Several fixes to handling LIST command more correctly.
v1.0.rc5 2006-08-02 Timo Sirainen
- Saving to mboxes still caused assert-crashes
v1.0.rc4 2006-08-02 Timo Sirainen
- Saving to mboxes caused assert-crashes
v1.0.rc3 2006-08-02 Timo Sirainen
- SSL connections hanged sometimes, especially when saving messages.
- mbox: Mail bodies were saved with CR+LF linefeeds
- Mail forwarding was broken with deliver/Sieve
- dbox fixes. Might actually be usable now.
- Index file handling fixes with keywords
- Cache file was incorrectly used in some situations, which probably
caused problems sometimes.
- Maildir++ quota: Don't count "." and ".." directory sizes to quota.
After rewriting maildirsize file keep its fd open so that we can
later update it. Patch by Alexander Zagrebin
v1.0.rc2 2006-07-04 Timo Sirainen
\* disable\_plaintext\_auth=yes: Removed hardcoded 127.\* and ::1 IP
checks. Now we just assume that the connection is secure if the
local IP matches the remote IP address.
\* SSL code rewrite which hopefully makes it work better than before.
Seems to work correctly, but if you suddently have trouble with SSL
connections this is likely the reason.
+ verbose\_ssl=yes: Log also SSL alerts and BIO errors
- If namespace's location field wasn't set, the default location
was supposed to be used but it wasn't.
- When copying ssl-parameters.dat file from /var/lib to /var/run its
permissions went wrong if it couldn't be copied with hard linking.
- Fixed filesystem quota plugin to work with BSDs.
- Maildir: Saving mails didn't work if quota plugin was enabled (again)
- Maildir: Messages' received time wasn't saved properly when
saving/copying multiple messages at a time. Also if using quota
plugin the S= size was only set for the first saved file, and even
that was wrong.
- passdb passwd-file: Don't require valid uid/gid fields if file
isn't also being used as a userdb.
- PostgreSQL: Handle failures better so that there won't be
"invalid fd" errors in logs.
- Don't try to expunge messages if the mailbox is read-only. It'll
just cause our index files to go out of sync with the real
mailbox and cause errors.
- ANONYMOUS authentication mechanism couldn't work because
anonymous\_username setting wasn't passed from master process.
v1.0.rc1 2006-06-28 Timo Sirainen
\* PAM: If user's password is expired, give "Password expired" error
message to the user. Now actually working thanks to Vaidas Pilkauskas
\* Relicensed dovecot-auth, lib-sql and lib-ntlm to MIT license. See
COPYING file for more information.
\* Abuse prevention: When creating a mailbox, limit the number of
hierarchies (up to 20) and the length of the mailbox name within
a hierarchy (up to 200 characters).
\* mbox: If saved mail doesn't end with LF, add it ourself so that the
mails always have one empty line before the next From-line.
+ Added --with-statedir configure option which defaults to
$localstatedir/lib/dovecot. ssl-parameters.dat is permanently
stored in that directory and is copied to login\_dirs from there.
+ IMAP: Support SASL-IR extension (SASL initial response)
+ Support initial SASL response with LOGIN mechanism. Patch by Anders
Karlsson
+ Added PLAIN-MD4 password scheme. Patch by Andrey Panin.
+ Added support for XFS disk quotas. Patch by Pawel Jarosz
+ If another process deletes the opened mailbox, try to handle it
without writing errors to log file. Handles the most common cases.
+ Added TLS support for LDAP if the library supports it.
- SEARCH command was more or less broken with OR and NOT conditions
- Dovecot corrupted mbox files which had CR+LF linefeeds in headers
- MySQL code could have crashed while escaping strings
- MD4 code with NTLM authentication was broken with 64bit systems.
Patch by Andrey Panin
- Plugin loading was broken in some OSes (eg. FreeBSD)
- Several fixes to handling empty values in configuration file
- Several fixes to dictionary quota backend and dict server.
Also changed how they're configured.
- deliver: Fixed plugin handling settings
- mbox\_min\_index\_size handling was somewhat broken
- passdb passwd-file: extra\_args field wasn't read unless the file
was also used as userdb.
v1.0.beta9 2006-06-13 Timo Sirainen
\* PAM: Don't call pam\_setcred() unless setcred=yes PAM passdb
argument was given.
\* Moved around settings in dovecot-example.conf to be in more logical
groups.
+ Local delivery agent (deliver binary) works again.
+ LDAP: Added support for SASL binding. Patch by Geert Jansen
+ ssl\_verify\_client\_cert: Check CRLs. If auth\_verbose=yes, log
invalid sent certificates. If verbose\_ssl=yes, log even the valid
certificates. When using the username from the certificate, use
CommonName. Based on patch by HenkJan Wolthuis
+ PAM: Set PAM\_TTY which is needed by some PAM plugins
+ dovecot --exec-mail ext  can now be used to start
binaries which want dovecot.conf to be read, for example the
convert-tool.
- Expunging needed to be done twice if client used STORE +FLAGS.SILENT
command to set the \Deleted flags
- Added sql\_escape\_string() to lib-sql API and use it instead of
normal \-escaping.
- ACL plugin fixes
- DIGEST-MD5: Trying to use subsequent authentication crashed
dovecot-auth.
- Fetching BODY when BODYSTRUCTURE was already cached caused the
reply to be broken in some cases
- Lots of fixes for index file handling
- dbox fixes and changes
- mbox syncing broke if some extraneous/broken headers were removed
(eg. extra X-IMAPbase headers in mails)
- Running Dovecot from inetd work now properly with POP3
- Quota plugin fixes for calculating the quota correctly
v1.0.beta8 2006-05-12 Timo Sirainen
\* Fixed a security hole with mbox: "1 LIST .. \*" command could
list all directories and files under the mbox root directory, so
if your mails were stored in eg. /var/mail/%u/ directory, the
command would list everything under /var/mail.
+ Unless nfs\_check=no or mmap\_disable=yes, check for the first login
if the user's index directory exists in NFS mount. If so, refuse to
run. This is done only on first login to avoid constant extra
overhead.
+ If we have plugins set and imap\_capability unset, figure out the
IMAP capabilities automatically by running imap binary at startup.
The generated capability list isn't updated until Dovecot is
restarted completely, so if you add or remove IMAP plugins you
should restart. If you have problems related to this, set
imap\_capabilities setting manually to work around it.
+ Added auth\_username\_format setting
- pop3\_lock\_session setting wasn't really working
- Lots of fixes related to quota handling. It's still not working
perfectly though.
- Lots of index handling fixes, especially with mmap\_disable=yes
- Maildir: saving mails could have sometimes caused "Append with UID
n, but next\_uid = m" errors
- flock() locking never timeouted because ignoring SIGALRM caused the
system call just to be restarted when SIGALRM occurred (probably not
with all OSes though?)
- kqueue: Fixed "Unrecognized event". Patch by Vaclav Haisman
v1.0.beta7 2006-04-12 Timo Sirainen
+ Added shutdown\_clients setting to control if existing imap/pop3
processes should be killed when master is.
- Master login fixes, PLAIN authentication was still broken..
v1.0.beta6 2006-04-12 Timo Sirainen
\* The login and master usernames were reversed when using
master\_user\_separator (now the order is UW-IMAP compatible).
\* Killing dovecot master process now kills all IMAP and POP3
processes also.
+ -a parameter to dovecot prints now all settings that Dovecot uses.
-n prints all settings that are different from defaults.
+ Added pop3\_lock\_session setting
+ %M modifier returns string's MD5 sum. Patch by Ben Winslow
- PLAIN SASL authentication wasn't working properly, causing failed
logins with some clients (broken in beta4)
- Fixes to Maildir++ quota, should actually work now
- Don't crash if passwd-file has entries without passwords
(eg. deny=yes databases)
- Fixed prefetch userdb to work nicely with other userdbs
- If master process runs out of file descriptors, don't go to
infinite loop (unlikely to have happened unless the OS's default
fd limit was too low)
- Fixed non-plaintext password lookups from LDAP. Patch by Lior Okman
- %U modifier was actually lowercasing the string. Patch by Ben Winslow
v1.0.beta5 2006-04-04 Timo Sirainen
- Beta4's SSL proxying rewrite worked worse than I thought.
Reverted it back to original code.
v1.0.beta4 2006-04-02 Timo Sirainen
\* Changed the default lock\_method back to fcntl. Apparently flock
gives problems with some systems.
\* mbox: mailboxes beginning with '.' are now also listed
\* Replaced mail\_use\_modules and mail\_modules settings with mail\_plugins
and mail\_plugin\_dir. Now instead of loading all plugins from the
directory, you'll have to give a list of plugins to load. If the
plugin couldn't be loaded, the process exits instead of just
ignoring the problem (this is important with ACL plugin).
+ Added support for "master users" who can log in as other people.
The master username can be given either in authorization ID
string with SASL PLAIN mechanism or by setting
auth\_master\_user\_separator and giving it within the normal username
string.
+ Added ACL plugin with ACL file backend. This however doesn't mean
that there yet exists a proper shared folder support. If master user
logged in as someone else, the ACLs are checked as the master user.
+ Added some Dovecot extensions to checkpassword passdb, see ChangeLog
+ Updated passwd-file format to allow specifying any key=value fields
+ Maildir++ quota support and several quota fixes
+ passdb supporting extra fields: Added "allow\_nets" option which takes
a comma separated list of IPs/networks where to allow user to log in.
+ NFS: Handle ESTALE errors the best way we can
+ IMAP now writes to log when client disconnects
+ In shared mailboxes (if dovecot-shared file exists) \Seen flags are
now kept only in index files, so as long as each user has a separate
index file they have separate \Seen flags.
- Fixes to DIGEST-MD5 realm handling so it works with more clients
- BODYSTRUCTURE -> BODY conversion from cache file was broken with
mails containing message/rfc822 parts.
- Fixed several memory leaks
- We could have sent client FETCH notifications about messages before
telling about them with EXISTS
- Compiling fixes for Solaris and some other OSes
- Fixed problem with internal timeout handling code, which caused eg.
outlook-idle workaround to break.
- If /dev/urandom didn't exist, we didn't seed OpenSSL's random number
generator properly. Patch by Vilmos Nebehaj.
- Maildir: Recent flags weren't always immediately removed from mails
when mailbox was opened.
- Several changes to SSL proxying code, hopefully making it work
better.
v1.0.beta3 2006-02-08 Timo Sirainen
\* Dotlock code changed to timeout faster in some situations when
the lock file is old.
+ Added support for loading SQL drivers dynamically (see INSTALL file
for how to build them)
+ Keywords are stored to dboxes, and other dbox improvements.
+ dict-sql could actually work now, making quota-in-sql-database
possibly working now (not fully tested)
+ Added mail storage conversion plugin to convert automatically from
one mailbox format to another while user logs in. Doesn't preserve
UIDVALIDITY/UIDs though.
+ Added plugin { .. } section to dovecot.conf for passing parameters
to plugins (see dovecot-example.conf).
+ Added ssl-build-param binary which is used to generate
ssl-parameters.dat. Main dovecot binary doesn't anymore link to
SSL libraries, and this also makes the process title be clearer
about why the process is eating all the CPU.
- Fix building without OpenSSL
- Fixed memory leak in MySQL driver
- Fixes to checkpassword
- Broken Content-Length header could have broken mbox opening
- Fixed potential hangs after APPEND command
- Fixed potential crashes in dovecot-auth and imap/pop3-login
- zlib plugin now links with -lz so it could actually work
- kqueue fixes by Vaclav Haisman
v1.0.beta2 2006-01-22 Timo Sirainen
+ Added SQLite support. Patch by Jakob Hirsch.
+ Added auth\_debug\_passwords setting. If it's not enabled, hide all
password strings from logs.
+ Added mail\_cache\_min\_mail\_count and mbox\_min\_index\_size settings
which can be used to make Dovecot do less disk writes in small
mailboxes where they don't benefit that much.
+ Added --build-ssl-parameters parameter to dovecot binary
- SSL parameters were being regenerated every 10 minutes, although
not with all systems.
- Fixed dovecot-auth crashing at startup. Happened only with some
specific compilers.
- base\_dir was supposed to be set world-readable, not world-writable
v1.0.beta1 2006-01-16 Timo Sirainen
\* Almost a complete rewrite since 0.99.x, but some of the major
changes are:
+ Index file code rewritten to do less disk I/O, wait locks less and
in generate be smarter. They also support being in clustered
filesystems and NFS support is mostly working also.
+ Mail caching is smarter. Only the data that client requests is
cached. Before Dovecot opened and cached all mails when mailbox was
opened the first time, which was slow.
+ Mbox handling code rewritten to be much faster, safer and correct
+ New authentication mechanisms: APOP, GSSAPI, LOGIN, NTLM and RPA.
+ LDAP supports authentication binds
+ Authentication server can cache password database lookups
+ Support for multiple authentication databases
+ Namespace configuration
+ Dovecot works with shared
v0.99.10 2003-06-26 Timo Sirainen
\* Default PAM service name changed to "dovecot". This means that
if you're using PAM, you most likely have to do
mv /etc/pam.d/imap /etc/pam.d/dovecot
If you wish to keep using imap, see doc/auth.txt.
\* ~/rawlog directory changed to ~/dovecot.rawlog
+ Faster and better maildir synchronization. We support read-only
maildirs and out-of-quota conditions are handled a lot better.
dovecot-uidlist file still isn't out-of-quota-safe though, but you
can keep it in another location where quota isn't checked. For
example:
default\_mail\_env = Maildir:~/Maildir:
INDEX=/noquota/%u:CONTROL=/noquota/%u
+ Read-only mboxes are supported now.
+ Only NOOP and CHECK now always do a mailbox sync checking. Other
commands sync max. once in 5 seconds, plus always from indexes.
This should reduce I/O a bit.
+ All NUL characters are translated to ascii #128 before sending to
client. RFC prohibits sending NULs and this is how UW-IMAP handles
it as well.
+ Make ENVELOPE, BODY and BODYSTRUCTURE replies more compact by
removing multiple LWSPs and translating TABs to spaces. RFC doesn't
specifically require this, but this seems to be the wanted
behaviour..
+ Added ANONYMOUS SASL mechanism.
+ More flexible user chrooting configuration in home directories:
"/./"
+ Added support for dynamically loadable IMAP/POP3 modules. See
INSTALL file for more information.
- Partial fetches were broken if mails had CR+LF linefeeds
- SEARCH DELETED didn't return anything if all messages were deleted
- OpenSSL support was broken in many installations because we were
chrooted and it couldn't open /dev/urandom.
- PAM: Giving wrong password blocked the whole process for two
seconds. Now we create a new process for each check.
- Lots of other smaller bugfixes and better error handling
v0.99.9.1 2003-05-03 Timo Sirainen
- Messages having lines longer than 8192 bytes caused problems.
- There was some problems when opening a mbox first time that had been
empty for a while.
- Didn't compile with OpenBSD.
- POP3 server crashed sometimes instead of printing error message.
- If cached IMAP envelope contained literals, SEARCHing in it wrote
errors to log file. For example if subject contained highascii, '"'
or '\' characters this happened.
v0.99.9 2003-04-28 Timo Sirainen
\* WARNING: mbox rewriting works now faster, but it's less likely to
notice external message flag changes (it wasn't perfect before
either). This also means that if you're not using index files,
Dovecot may not notice changes made by another Dovecot process.
This will be fixed later.
+ Message UIDs are now permanently stored outside index files.
Deleting indexes is now possible without any kind of data loss and
in-memory indexes are now usable.
+ mbox rewriting leaves extra space into X-Keywords header. It's
shrinked or grown when updating message flag headers to avoid
rewriting the rest of the file.
+ imap-login and pop3-login can now be started from inetd. Privilege
separation is still used, so it executes dovecot and dovecot-auth
processes which are left on the background.
+ PostgreSQL authentication support, patch by Alex Howansky
- Large multiline headers (over 8kB) broke Dovecot before. Now they're
parsed one line at a time and we try to avoid reading them fully into
memory.
- SEARCH OR was broken
- Partial BODY[] fetches were broken
- Timezones were still set wrong when parsing dates
- Using non-synchronized literals (LITERAL+) broke APPEND
- Renaming maildir subfolders inserted extra "." in the middle.
- Subfolders were a bit broken with maildir
- Invalid PLAIN auth request crashed auth process.
v0.99.8 2003-02-25 Timo Sirainen
\* NOTE: Configuration file has changed a bit: auth\_userinfo was
replaced by userdb and passdb. \*\_port were merged into \*\_listen.
Disabling listening in imaps port is now done by changing protocols
setting.
\* Maildir: .customflags location has changed for INBOX. If you have
set any custom flags, move Maildir/.INBOX/.customflags into
Maildir/.customflags or they will be lost.
\* mbox: Autodetect /var/mail/%u and /var/spool/mail/%u as INBOXes
if they're found and mail\_default\_env isn't set.
\* passwd-file: File format changed a bit. If you used realm or mail
fields, you'll have to fix the file. See doc/auth.txt for description
of the format.
+ Fully featured POP3 server included. Disabled by default.
+ Support for LITERAL+, MULTIAPPEND, UNSELECT, IDLE, CHILDREN and
LISTEXT extensions.
+ LDAP authentication support.
+ Internal API cleanups made Dovecot faster and take less memory
+ auth\_verbose logs now all authentication failures
+ Support for Solaris 9 sendfilev()
+ New setting: mail\_full\_filesystem\_access allows clients to access the
whole filesystem by simply giving the path before the mailbox name
(eg. SELECT ~user/mail/box, LIST "" /tmp/%). While this allows users
to share mailboxes, it's not recommended since Dovecot's index files
can't be safely shared.
+ New setting: client\_workarounds.
+ Dynamically loadable authentication modules. Binary package builders
should consider using it for at least LDAP.
+ mbox: Content-Length is saved now to each saved message, so it's
now safe to have lines beginning with "From ".
+ mbox: mail\_read\_mmaped = no works with it now
+ Indexes can be kept in memory by adding :INDEX=MEMORY to MAIL
environment. There's not much point to do this now though, since the
UIDs won't be saved.
- COPY now behaves as RFC2060 says: "If the COPY command is
unsuccessful for any reason, server implementations MUST restore the
destination mailbox to its state before the COPY attempt."
- LIST and LSUB rewrite, should fix several bugs in them
- maildir\_copy\_with\_hardlinks = yes was broken.
- mboxes in subfolders weren't selectable.
- STORE didn't accept multiple flags without () around them
- PLAIN SASL-authentication was a bit broken.
- IMAP dates were parsed a few hours wrong
- STATUS command removed \Recent flags from messages
- Several bugfixes to SEARCH command, especially related to multiple
search conditions
- If auth/login process died unexpectedly at startup, the exit status
or killing signal wasn't logged.
- mbox parsing might have crashed sometimes
- mbox: when saving mails, internal headers were allowed in input,
sometimes causing problems (eg. duplicate headers) when appending
and copying messages
- mbox: X-Keywords headers were duplicated
- Some small fixes to how messages are saved to Maildir
- Next command after STARTTLS was ignored which left the connection
stuck sometimes
- Dovecot was pretty much broken with FreeBSD
v0.99.7 2003-01-14 Timo Sirainen
+ Rewrote doc/index.txt, small updates to doc/design.txt and
doc/multiaccess.txt
- New hash table code was broken with removing, which broke several
things. Fixed, but it's still a bit ugly code though..
v0.99.6 2003-01-13 Timo Sirainen
+ THREAD=REFERENCES extension support. ORDEREDSUBJECT would be easy to
add, but I think it's pretty useless.
+ SORT is much faster now.
+ mbox: If ~/mail directory isn't found, create it.
+ Log login usernames
\* Some coding style changes (less typedefs)
- Mails with nested MIME parts might have caused incorrect BODY and
BODYSTRUCTURE fetches and sometimes might have crashed dovecot
(assert at imap-bodystructure.c). If client had already successfully
done the BODY fetching a couple of times, the bug couldn't happen
anymore since Dovecot then began caching the BODY data. So, this
mostly happened with new users.
- non-UID SEARCH might gave wrong replies in certain conditions.
- SORT replied always with UIDs instead of sequences.
- If authentication was aborted by client ("\*" reply to AUTHENTICATE),
the login process crashed later.
- STATUS command gave invalid reply for mailboxes with spaces in name
- Timezones were parsed wrong with message dates
- Digest-MD5: We used "qop-options" instead of "qop", which was
incompatible with at least Cyrus SASL.
- Realms in passwd-file were buggy
- Literals didn't work when logging in
- Crashed if it had to wait for mbox lock
- With invalid configuration auth and login processes were just dying
and master filling log files infinitely.
- We didn't work with some 64bit systems
v0.99.5 2003-01-02 Timo Sirainen
\* This release includes a lot of code cleanups, especially related to
security. Direct buffer modifying was replaced in several places
with a new buffer API, which provides a safe way to do it. Code that
looks unsafe contains @UNSAFE tag to make auditing easier.
+ Support for SORT extension. Originally I thought about not
implementing any extensions before 1.0, but too many people want
webmails which want SORT. THREAD is another extension which they
want, but we don't support it yet.
+ imap\_listen and imaps\_listen settings now accept "\*" and "::" to
specify if we want to listen in IPv4 or IPv6 addresses. "::" may
also listen in all IPv4 addresses depending on the OS (Linux does,
BSD doesn't)
+ New setting: default\_mail\_env can be used to specify where to find
users mailbox. Default is still to use autodetection.
+ New setting: imap\_log\_path to log logins etc. informational messages
to different file.
+ We support now separate mbox file for INBOX folder, no need for
symlink kludging anymore.
+ Support for keeping index files in different location than actual
mailboxes.
? Disabled mailbox\_check\_interval setting by default, it breaks
Evolution.
- SEARCH was still somewhat buggy, especially with laggy networks.
Also body/header searches might have crashed or at least used
memory too much
- Deleting messages in the middle of mbox caused dovecot to reindex
the following messages as new messages (ie. change UIDs and set
\Recent flag).
- Digest-MD5 auth: Initial server challenge packet was missing a comma,
which might have made it incompatible with some implementations.
- Some more fixes to unnecessarily high memory usage
- SELECT and EXAMINE often printed UNSEEN reply or maybe complained
about corrupted indexes. Happened usually only with mbox.
- FETCH BODYSTRUCTURE gave incorrect reply, breaking pine
- LIST was pretty buggy with mbox subfolders
- CHECK command returned just "missing parameters" error
- DELETE didn't work with mbox folders
- CREATE mailbox failed always.
- CREATE and RENAME didn't create required hierarchies with mbox
- RFC822 date parser didn't handle single digit days correctly.
- login\_process\_per\_connection = yes didn't work with imaps port
connections which is exactly where it was mostly wanted.
- ssl\_disabled = yes didn't disable listening in imaps port
- process limiting code didn't compile everywhere (eg. FreeBSD).
- Linux sendfile() was never detected
- We didn't work at all with gcc/PowerPC
v0.99.4 2002-12-01 Timo Sirainen
- Command parser had several bugs when it didn't have enough data to
parse the full command in one call, ie. network lags etc. triggered
those bugs sometimes. This was the last "weird bug" I know of.
- Mbox indexes got broken when updating cached fields
- Fixed a few memory leaks and unneededly high memory usage while
caching envelopes
- Fixes to searching from message body and header
- --with-ssldir didn't do anything and the default was empty
v0.99.3 2002-11-26 Timo Sirainen
- mail\_read\_mmaped = no (default) caused mbox corruption with EXPUNGE.
mmap()ing is forced for now.
v0.99.2 2002-11-26 Timo Sirainen
+ If we have to wait for a lock longer, the client is now notified
about it every 30 seconds.
- Default settings still pointed to lib directory instead of the
libexec directory where the binaries were actually installed
- vpopmail support had to be kludged to fix a bug in vpopmail library
which sometimes left extra character after the user name.
- Login process crashed if master process didn't let some user login.
Normally this couldn't happen without error in configuration.
- select() based I/O loop wasn't working so Dovecot didn't work in
eg. OSX. Also PAM authentication wasn't detected with OSX.
- Didn't compile with NetBSD-current
v0.99.1 2002-11-25 Timo Sirainen
+ Added doc/mkcert.sh script to easily generate yourself a self-signed
certificate. Modify doc/dovecot-openssl.cnf before running it.
+ --with-ssldir configure option to specify default path for /etc/ssl
+ Added ssl\_disable setting to config file
- OpenSSL wasn't checked properly by configure
- vpopmail authentication module didn't compile
- We should install the binaries into libexec dir, not lib
- doc/configuration.txt and doc/mail-storages.txt were missing
v0.99.0 2002-11-24 Timo Sirainen
+ Replaced hash file with binary tree file which makes Dovecot stay
fast with large mailboxes after expunging multiple mails.
+ Several speed improvements with SEARCH
+ SEARCH CHARSET support using iconv(), although case-insensitive
searching is currently supported only for ASCII characters.
+ OpenSSL support.
+ Support for regenerating Diffie Hellman and RSA parameters with
specified intervals. NOTE: currently doesn't work with OpenSSL.
+ Support for each login connection being handled in it's own process.
This is the default as it's more safe especially with SSL.
+ mbox locking is now safe, other processes can't modify the mbox file
while we're reading it.
+ Notify clients with "EXISTS" almost immediately after new mail is
received.
+ Rawlog: Support for saving user connections into files - useful for
debugging.
+ Content-Language is finally parsed correctly
+ Lots of smaller speed optimizations
- Partial BODY[] fetches weren't working properly
- BODY[section] was buggy with message/rfc822 MIME parts
- STARTTLS wasn't working
- \\* flag was missing from PERMANENTFLAGS.
- Comments inside <> mail addresses crashed.
- imap-login printed UTC timestamps to logfiles
- passwd-file wasn't reread the the file changed
- PAM authentication was implemented wrong, which caused it to break
with some PAM plugins.
- Lots of smaller fixes, mostly to do with reliability
v0.98.4 2002-10-06 Timo Sirainen
\* Just a final release before replacing hash file with a binary tree.
- When fetching messages larger than 256k, sometimes Dovecot missed
to send CR causing corrupted data at end of message and possibly
complete failure depending on IMAP client.
- Fetching BODY or BODYSTRUCTURE for message having content-type of
message/rfc822 didn't correctly add () around the envelope data.
- Several fixes to make it compile with HP/UX ANSI C compiler.
Also fixed several warnings it showed up.
v0.98.3 2002-10-01 Timo Sirainen
\* Sorry, just noticed a very stupid bug which caused evolution 1.2
beta to crash. I always thought it was just evolution's fault :)
- Several fields in BODY / BODYSTRUCTURE replies weren't quoted
v0.98.2 2002-09-30 Timo Sirainen
+ --with-file-offset-size=32 can now be used to select 32bit file
offsets. Using them should be a bit faster and take a bit less
disk and memory (also needed to compile Dovecot successfully with
TinyCC).
+ maildir\_copy\_with\_hardlinks option works now
+ Check new mail and notify about it to client also after
commands which don't allow full syncing (FETCH, STORE, SEARCH).
Also always send RECENT after EXISTS notify.
+ If we're out of disk space while opening mailbox, notify about it
with ALERT.
- STORE and SEARCH didn't handle properly message sequence numbers
when some in the middle were externally deleted
- SEARCH: Only first search condition was checked.
- mbox: Message flags given to APPEND were ignored.
- mbox: index was corrupted when changing flags for multipart MIME
messages
- Out of disk space-handling wasn't working properly with .customflags
file
- if auth processes were killed, login processes weren't reconnecting
to them
v0.98.1 2002-09-24 Timo Sirainen
+ Faster and safer mbox rewriting when flags are updated
- Didn't save messages larger then 8192 bytes
- Several mbox breakages
v0.98 2002-09-23 Timo Sirainen
+ mbox support is finally working. There's still some reliability
fixes left but overall it should be quite usable.
+ vpopmail authentication support
+ We should be able to deal with "out of diskspace/quota" conditions
properly, by keeping the indexes in memory and allowing user to
delete mails to get more space.
+ Several speed enhancements
+ New configuration file option: overwrite\_incompatible\_index to force
using ".imap.index" file, overwriting it if it isn't compatible
- Handle invalid message headers reliably
- Tons of bugfixes and code cleanups everywhere
v0.97 2002-08-29 Timo Sirainen
+ Large mails are handled in 256kB blocks, so mail size no longer
has hardly any effect on memory usage
+ 64bit file offsets are used if supported by system. This means
Dovecot is fully capable of handling >2G mails in those systems.
With 32bit offsets >2G mails may not behave too well, but should
not crash either.
+ I fixed lots of potential integer overflows. This should make us
fully crash-free no matter what happens (index file corruption
mostly). I didn't verify everything too carefully yet, so more
auditing is still needed before we fully reach that goal.
+ Implemented several missing tasks / optimizations to index handling.
It should now stay fast after longer usage periods.
+ New configuration file options: log\_path, log\_timestamp, imaps\_listen
+ "Critical errors" are now hidden from users, ie. any error message
that is not a direct reply to user error is written into log file
and user gets only "Internal error [timestamp]".
+ Nonblocking SSL handshaking
+ Lots of code cleanups
- Lots of mbox fixes, it seems to be somewhat reliable now
- Year in Date-field was parsed wrong
- Appending mail to mbox didn't work right
- Always verify that mailbox names are valid (especially they shouldn't
contain "../")
v0.96 2002-08-08 Timo Sirainen
\* Changed to LGPL v2.1 license
+ STARTTLS support and optional disabling of plaintext authentication
(LOGINDISABLED capability)
+ Support for custom message flags, each folder can have 26 different.
+ New configuration file options: imap\_listen, max\_logging\_users,
max\_imap\_processes
+ You can specify config file location to imap-master with -c
+ All IMAP processes can now write to specified log file instead of
syslog. Either do this by setting IMAP\_LOGFILE environment, or
give -l  parameter to imap-master.
+ Some cleanups to remove warnings with BSDs
+ Changed all %s .. strerror(errno) -> %m
+ Rewritten memory pool code
- imap-master didn't close all the fds for executed processes
- iobuffer code was buggy and caused the connection to terminate
sometimes
- make install overwrote the existing dovecot.conf file, so it's now
named as dovecot-example.conf
v0.95 2002-07-31 Timo Sirainen
+ Initial SSL support using GNU TLS, tested with v0.5.1.
TLS support is still missing.
+ Digest-MD5 authentication method
+ passwd-file authentication backend
+ Code cleanups
- Found several bugs from mempool and ioloop code, now we should
be stable? :)
- A few corrections for long header field handling
v0.94 2002-07-29 Timo Sirainen
\* Supports running completely non-root now. imap-auth however is a
bit problematic as we don't support passwd-file yet.
- Memory alignment fixes mostly
- Other misc. bugfixes

## Topic

Updated dovecot packages that fix three security issues and one bug are now
available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this update as having low
security impact. Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores,
which give detailed severity ratings, are available for each vulnerability
from the CVE links in the References section.

## Description

Dovecot is an IMAP server, written with security primarily in mind, for
Linux and other UNIX-like systems. It also contains a small POP3 server. It
supports mail in either of maildir or mbox formats. The SQL drivers and
authentication plug-ins are provided as sub-packages.

Two flaws were found in the way some settings were enforced by the
script-login functionality of Dovecot. A remote, authenticated user could
use these flaws to bypass intended access restrictions or conduct a
directory traversal attack by leveraging login scripts. (CVE-2011-2166,
CVE-2011-2167)

A flaw was found in the way Dovecot performed remote server identity
verification, when it was configured to proxy IMAP and POP3 connections to
remote hosts using TLS/SSL protocols. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks using an X.509 certificate issued by
a trusted Certificate Authority (for a different name). (CVE-2011-4318)

This update also fixes the following bug:

* When a new user first accessed their IMAP inbox, Dovecot was, under some

circumstances, unable to change the group ownership of the inbox directory
in the user's Maildir location to match that of the user's mail spool
(/var/mail/$USER). This correctly generated an "Internal error occurred"
message. However, with a subsequent attempt to access the inbox, Dovecot
saw that the directory already existed and proceeded with its operation,
leaving the directory with incorrectly set permissions. This update
corrects the underlying permissions setting error. When a new user now
accesses their inbox for the first time, and it is not possible to set
group ownership, Dovecot removes the created directory and generates an
error message instead of keeping the directory with incorrect group
ownership. (BZ#697620)

Users of dovecot are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing the
updated packages, the dovecot service will be restarted automatically.

## Solution

Before applying this update, make sure all previously-released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to
use the Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
