## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

Symptoms are a bit different in 3.4/3.6 and in 4.0/4.2, but it's one same problem:
3.4/3.6:
=======
When entering a new bug, you can pass bit-X=1 to list of parameters, where X is a group ID, and if the group exists but is not used for bugs, then you get:
"Attempted to add bug to the 'foo' group, which is not used for bugs."
If the group ID exists but is either a system group or a user group used for bugs, then you get no error. So only the name of user groups which aren't used for bugs can be disclosed.
For existing bugs, there is no name disclosed, because the error message displays the group ID instead.
4.0/4.2:
=======
When editing an existing bug, you can pass groups=foo to the list of parameters, where foo is the group name, and if the group doesn't exist, process\_bug.cgi tells you so:
"There is no group named 'foo'."
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/process_bug.cgi?id=653341&groups=I_love_LpSolit>
If the group exists, you get:
"You tried to restrict bug X to to the 'foo' group, but bugs in the 'TestProduct' product can not be restricted to that group." (nit: note also the typo "to to")
<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/process_bug.cgi?id=653341&groups=bugzilla-approvers>
When creating a new bug, illegal groups are silently ignored ([bug 653341](/show_bug.cgi?id=653341 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bug.create() fails to error out if an invalid group is passed")).

We could just change the default error message for Group->check by overriding check() in Bugzilla::Group. I think we want to be pretty secretive about this everywhere but the Groups control panel.

I will try to fix this bug before we release 4.0.2 and before we branch for 4.2, else it will be a pain to track as it will conflict with [bug 658887](/show_bug.cgi?id=658887 "NEW - Simplify product group controls").

Attached patch

[patch for 4.2, v1](attachment.cgi?id=549383&action=diff) (obsolete)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=549383&action=edit)
â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=653477&attachment=549383)

With this patch applied, Bugzilla no longer leaks group names when it shouldn't. This means:
- If the bug is already restricted to group A, and a user tries to restrict the bug to group A again, add\_group() does nothing as this is technically not a change. This behavior is consistent with how other fields behave: if you don't change a field value, then there is no reason to complain.
- If the bug is not yet restricted to group A, then either group A doesn't exist and we complain, or group A exists but the user is not allowed to restrict the bug to this group and we complain we \*exactly\* the same error message, i.e. "either the group doesn't exist, or you are not allowed to ...", or group A exists and the user is allowed to restrict the bug to this group and add\_group() does it. This reasoning applies for both new bugs and existing bugs.
- If the bug is not restricted to group B and the user tries to remove the bug from group B, then remove\_group() does nothing as this is technically not a change. This way, we don't leak if the group doesn't exist, or exists but the bug is not restricted to this group.
- If the bug is restricted to group B and the user tries to remove the bug from this group, then either group B cannot be removed by this user and remove\_group() complains about it, or the user can remove this group and remove\_group() does it.
About moving a bug into another product, \_set\_product() no longer removes inactive groups if the group exists in both products, because if products A and B both have group C as an inactive group (simply because you don't want to add new bugs to this group, but want to keep those already restricted to this group as is), then you can still move bugs between both products without disclosing them publicly. I also fixed the logic so that only a member of group C can remove the bug from this group, even if this inactive group C is mandatory (the old code also let non-members remove bugs from inactive groups, which could be a problem for archived bugs in an inactive group, if the non-member was CC'ed, for instance). Else this would mean that inactive groups could be removed even by non-members, which would make them less secure, and admins probably do not expect this behavior (because they don't read the source code!).
For mass-change into a new product, the behavior is the same as when moving a single bug.
The patch has a small bitrot in Bugzilla/WebService/Constants.pm for Bugzilla 4.0.2 and so doesn't apply there. I will upload backports once this one gets r+.

Overall looks good and works fine with my testing. Another unrelated issue I found that I can file a separate bug for is that when verifying a product change, if you do not have one or more items selected for component/version/milestone, and then hit submit, the form reloads but any group change verification is no longer displayed on the second try. This due to the check for !$verified on line 2470 in Bugzilla/Bug.pm only working for the initial product verification screen load. I feel if the user still needs to select component/version/milestone, they should still see the groups list as well. Anyway I will file that separately.

There is no code change compared to 4.2 (use interdiff to check that). The reason the patch for 4.2 didn't apply on the 4.0 branch is because a comment has been edited in 4.2 only, causing the conflict.

The same patch applies to both 3.4 and 3.6. The fix on these branches is much smaller as in Bugzilla 3.x, we only mentioned the group ID in error messages instead of the group name, except in this single place, which this patch fixes. This is the single place where we call the 'inactive\_group' error message, so this change is safe.

Well, feel free to review them. But I'm pretty confident with them. And the backport for 3.x is ultra-safe. I simply reword the error message.

I really would like a Bugzilla::Group->check\_carefully or something like that instead of re-writing this everywhere. The \_error parameter starts with an underscore because it's only supposed to be used by people who are overriding check() in a subclass.

I would really rather not be silent here, for the sake of the Bug.update webservice. There are going to be a lot of programs that depend on solid feedback from the WebService, and this will hide bugs and confuse API consumers if the removal is silent. It isn't a big security issue like add\_group being silent, but it will still be very frustrating to downstream consumers.

This is a lot more work than just grabbing the name from the database; could we do this change in another bug? I've wanted to do it for a long time and it probably actually will \*help\* performance, but I'm concerned about making this change hidden here behind the security filter.

Why add isbuggroup there? A group could not have gotten into this table without isbuggroup being true.

I really disagree here. That's the whole point of my code. Don't complain about a change which is not a change (as the bug is not in the group). As I explained on IRC, remove\_group() is the better way to query for the existence of groups, because when you move a bug into another product and the group doesn't exist, you don't want to throw an error. That's the entry point to brute force the existence of groups.

And we don't throw an error if you try to set a field to a value which is already set, AFAIK. Behaving differently for groups doesn't make sense to me, even if we are talking about security here.

Exactly, that's true. But enforcing this here will prevent any "broken" installation from behaving in a weird way (custom code which did something incorrectly comes to mind). It's just an extra security enhancement which doesn't hurt.

But we do throw an error in every other field if you try to set \*or\* remove a value which doesn't exist at all in Bugzilla.

Okay, I'd rather skip adding it there, then. I would prefer to catch errors rather than hide them.

 Also, theoretically it could hurt; the MySQL query optimizer could choose to use that field's index, which would be just about the poorest-possible index to use (although to be fair, isactive may be equally bad in most installations).

Attached patch

[patch for 4.2, v2](attachment.cgi?id=550488&action=diff) (obsolete)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=550488&action=edit)
â€” [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=653477&attachment=550488)

Now throws an error when remove\_group() is called and the bug is not restricted to the given group. But I fixed process\_bug.cgi to not call this method when unnecessary, i.e. it only calls it when a group is really added or removed. This way we are consistent with how Bugzilla 2.x and 3.x worked (and this makes more sense to me too).

So, why not move this logic into set\_all? Having custom code inside of process\_bug is difficult, because it means that extensions and other consumers (like the WebService) don't behave consistently with how the web interface works.

Is the removal error already set to a number somewhere in here, or should we also add it?

I agree that this would be a better fit in set\_all.

Okay, LpSolit explained this to me--basically if we try to remove group boxes that are unchecked but not set, this will throw an error, which would be nonsensical from the user's perspective.
Let's only modify the removed groups, not the added groups, to keep this code simple. Also, let's clarify the comment to explain what LpSolit explained to me.

Attached patch

[patch for 4.2, v2.1](attachment.cgi?id=550559&action=diff) (obsolete)

OK, here is my final patch for 4.2. I tested it as much as possible, with different privs. The same code applies to 4.0.2, modulo two conflicts (one in a comment, the other one in the POD).

For future-proofness, probably best to put "local" in front of that line (in case somebody wants to do something with set\_all\_fields later on in this file, even though they probably shouldn't).

When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

Regression due to [bug 574556](/show_bug.cgi?id=574556 "RESOLVED FIXED - Refactor Search.pm so that we're not doing $$some_var everywhere"), i.e. since Bugzilla 4.1.1:
Run the two queries below:
1) Assignee is equal to %group.foo%
2) Assignee is equal to %group.canconfirm%
In Bugzilla 4.0.x and below, you get the same error message, independently of whether the group exists or not, to not leak this information, see [bug 417048](/show_bug.cgi?id=417048 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] Boolean charts let me query for users being in any given group"). But this regressed again in 4.1.1 as ValidateGroupName() has been replaced by Bugzilla::Group->check(), which throws an explicit error message if the group doesn't exist.Flags: blocking4.2+

Ah, we should have Bugzilla::Group->check\_carefully. Could somebody please implement that?

                 CVE-2011-2381 CVE-2011-2978

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bugzilla, a web-based bug
tracking system.

CVE-2010-4572

  By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
  possible to inject both headers and content to any
  browser.

CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

  Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
  of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
  it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
  clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
  attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
  protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
  Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
  "data:" links were *always* shown as clickable to
  logged-out users.

CVE-2010-4568

  It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
  any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
  enough that the attack is highly effective).

CVE-2011-0046

  Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
  as previous CSRF vulnerabilities.

CVE-2011-2978

  When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts
  a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail
  address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker
  has access to the session of another user (for example,
  if that user left their browser window open in a public
  place), the attacker could alter this field to cause
  the email-change notification to go to their own address.
  This means that the user would not be notified that his
  account had its email address changed by the attacker.

CVE-2011-2381

  For flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline
  in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in
  email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.

CVE-2011-2379

  Bugzilla uses an alternate host for attachments when
  viewing them in raw format to prevent cross-site scripting
  attacks. This alternate host is now also used when viewing
  patches in "Raw Unified" mode because Internet Explorer 8
  and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,
  which could lead to the execution of malicious code.

CVE-2011-2380 CVE-201-2979

  Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible
  to members of the group, and to non-members if the group
  is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or
  editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed
  or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so
  which were supposed to remain confidential.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), it has not been practical to
backport patches to fix these bugs. Users of bugzilla on lenny are
strongly advised to upgrade to the version in the squeeze distribution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.2.0-4.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
the bugzilla packages have been removed.

We recommend that you upgrade your bugzilla packages.
