# End of Service/End of Life for Signature Services for Intrusion Detection and Prevention

The signature service for the IPS device you have inquired about is obsolete and has reached end of service. Signature downloads will no longer be available for this platform.

Products reach the end of their product life cycle for a number of reasons. These reasons may be due to market demands, technology innovation and development driving changes in the product, or the products simply maturing over time and being replaced by technology that offers better functionality. While this is an established part of the overall product life cycle, Cisco Systems recognizes that end-of-life milestones often prompt companies to review the way in which such end-of-sale and end-of-life milestones impact the Cisco products in their networks. With that in mind, [Cisco's End-of-Life Policy](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) helps customers manage their end-of-life transition and understand the role that Cisco can play in helping them migrate to alternative Cisco platforms and technologies.

The end-of-sale and support timeline for IPS signatures aligns with the end-of-sale and support policies for the products. Details can be found in [End-of-Sale and End-of-Life Announcement for the Cisco Intrusion Prevention System](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/security/ips-4200-series-sensors/eos-eol-notice-c51-733186.html).

Cisco will support and provide signature updates for a platform until the date explicitly documented in the products end-of-sale notice. When the End of Signature Support date is not explicitly documented, signature support and updates will be provided for 3 years after the end-of-sale date, as described in the End-of-Sale Policy for Signature File Release on Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDS/IPS) Sensors.

In order to maintain the maximum IPS protection, Cisco recommends its current IPS technology. Details can be found here: <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/ngips/index.html>
