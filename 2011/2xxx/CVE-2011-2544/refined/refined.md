Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2544:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate user input in the Cisco TelePresence endpoints' web interface. Specifically, the Call ID (used with H.323 or SIP) field allows HTML input without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is HTML injection. By setting the Call ID to an arbitrary HTML string, an attacker can inject malicious code into the web interface of a Cisco TelePresence endpoint.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The root cause is that the system fails to validate or sanitize input in the H.323 ID or SIP Display Name fields, allowing malicious HTML code to be stored and rendered.
*   **Post-Authentication:** This vulnerability is triggered after a user has authenticated to the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie/Credential Theft:** Attackers could potentially steal cookies or credentials of authenticated users who view the call statistics through the web interface.
*   **Impersonation:** By executing code in the context of an authenticated user, attackers could potentially impersonate legitimate users.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality:** Malicious actions could lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Client-Side Code Execution:**  The injected HTML can execute arbitrary code within the user's browser, allowing for malicious actions.
*  **System Modification**: Attackers could modify system settings, such as passwords, encryption or enabling telnet access.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not the primary impact, denial of service can occur in combination with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves an attacker setting a malicious HTML string as the Call ID via H.323 or SIP. This malicious data is stored.
*   A legitimate, authenticated user needs to access the web interface on the endpoint to view call statistics. This causes the stored HTML to render locally.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a call to a Cisco TelePresence endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to be able to set the Call ID field with the malicious HTML payload during call setup.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target endpoint.
*   The attacker does need a user who has access to the web interface on the receiving end of the call to browse the interface to activate the attack.

**Additional Details from Exploit-DB:**

*   The advisory from Sense of Security provides concrete examples of how the HTML injection can be used to perform actions such as rebooting the system, changing passwords, disabling encryption or enabling telnet.
*   The vulnerability is specific to Cisco TelePresence Endpoints, including the C and MXP series.

**Summary:**

CVE-2011-2544 describes a post-authentication HTML injection vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence endpoints. The lack of proper input validation for the Call ID/SIP Display Name allows for an attacker to inject malicious HTML which executes when a logged in user views call statistics through the web interface. This could lead to credential theft, system modification, impersonation, and other attacks.
