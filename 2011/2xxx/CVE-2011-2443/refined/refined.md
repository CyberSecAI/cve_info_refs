Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2011-2443:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0 and earlier versions when processing specially crafted `.ABR` (brushes) and `.GRD` (gradients) format files.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize user input, leading to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a buffer overflow, which occurs when the application writes data beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not validate or sanitize user-supplied data in `.ABR` and `.GRD` files, making it susceptible to crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can also result in a denial-of-service scenario, causing the application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through malicious `.ABR` and `.GRD` files.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open a malicious file using the vulnerable version of Adobe Photoshop Elements. This is typically achieved through social engineering or by embedding the malicious files on websites or in emails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create or obtain crafted `.ABR` or `.GRD` files that trigger the buffer overflow.
*   The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file using a vulnerable version of Adobe Photoshop Elements.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Photoshop Elements versions 8.0 and 7.0 and possibly earlier.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Gjoko 'LiquidWorm' Krstic of Zero Science Lab.
*   Adobe has released an advisory (APSA11-03) and recommends users upgrade to Photoshop Elements 10 (or 9, as a second recommendation).
*   The vulnerability is categorized as "critical" by Adobe.
*   The exploit is considered to be remotely exploitable
*   The affected platform is Windows.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-120 (Classic Buffer Overflow)
