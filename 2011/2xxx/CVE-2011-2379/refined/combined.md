## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

                 CVE-2011-2381 CVE-2011-2978

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Bugzilla, a web-based bug
tracking system.

CVE-2010-4572

  By inserting particular strings into certain URLs, it was
  possible to inject both headers and content to any
  browser.

CVE-2010-4567, CVE-2011-0048

  Bugzilla has a "URL" field that can contain several types
  of URL, including "javascript:" and "data:" URLs. However,
  it does not make "javascript:" and "data:" URLs into
  clickable links, to protect against cross-site scripting
  attacks or other attacks. It was possible to bypass this
  protection by adding spaces into the URL in places that
  Bugzilla did not expect them. Also, "javascript:" and
  "data:" links were *always* shown as clickable to
  logged-out users.

CVE-2010-4568

  It was possible for a user to gain unauthorized access to
  any Bugzilla account in a very short amount of time (short
  enough that the attack is highly effective).

CVE-2011-0046

  Various pages were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
  Forgery attacks. Most of these issues are not as serious
  as previous CSRF vulnerabilities.

CVE-2011-2978

  When a user changes his email address, Bugzilla trusts
  a user-modifiable field for obtaining the current e-mail
  address to send a confirmation message to. If an attacker
  has access to the session of another user (for example,
  if that user left their browser window open in a public
  place), the attacker could alter this field to cause
  the email-change notification to go to their own address.
  This means that the user would not be notified that his
  account had its email address changed by the attacker.

CVE-2011-2381

  For flagmails only, attachment descriptions with a newline
  in them could lead to the injection of crafted headers in
  email notifications when an attachment flag is edited.

CVE-2011-2379

  Bugzilla uses an alternate host for attachments when
  viewing them in raw format to prevent cross-site scripting
  attacks. This alternate host is now also used when viewing
  patches in "Raw Unified" mode because Internet Explorer 8
  and older, and Safari before 5.0.6 do content sniffing,
  which could lead to the execution of malicious code.

CVE-2011-2380 CVE-201-2979

  Normally, a group name is confidential and is only visible
  to members of the group, and to non-members if the group
  is used in bugs. By crafting the URL when creating or
  editing a bug, it was possible to guess if a group existed
  or not, even for groups which weren't used in bugs and so
  which were supposed to remain confidential.

For the oldstable distribution (lenny), it has not been practical to
backport patches to fix these bugs. Users of bugzilla on lenny are
strongly advised to upgrade to the version in the squeeze distribution.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.2.0-4.4.

For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
the bugzilla packages have been removed.

We recommend that you upgrade your bugzilla packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the worldâ€™s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoftâ€™s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that arenâ€™t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13
Build Identifier:
A valid patch file, uploaded as an attachment to a Bugzilla installation (and marked as a patch), can be served up raw from the Bugzilla installation's main domain with Content-type text/plain. In IE 6 through 8, that Content-type triggers HTML sniffing behavior: as such, a malicious patch containing HTML will be parsed when viewed in those browsers, allowing for the execution of JavaScript in the context of the Bugzilla installation.
Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a patch file containing HTML
2. Upload it as an attachment to an existing bug, making sure to mark it as a patch
3. Under Attachments, find your malicious patch and click on "Diff" (it's right next to "Details")
4. Up toward the top of the page, click on "Raw Unified". Notice the address bar does not switch domains, as it normally does when serving up user content.
5. If you're in IE, you should see the attachment being parsed as HTML.

Oh actually, that "Raw Unified" serves from this domain is a valid security issue.
[bug 453425](/show_bug.cgi?id=453425 "RESOLVED FIXED - Bugzilla should use \"X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\" for attachments") does prevent this from happening on IE 8 and above, but we still need to fix this bug, to protect IE 6 & 7 users.

It's a semi-valid security issue. We explicitly display the attachment as text/plain. It's this stupid IE "feature" which converts it into text/html.

And Safari ;-)
By adding /test.html to the end of the URL path (after /attachment.cgi, before ?), Safari will perform content sniffing and parse the HTML.

All versions of Safari, or what exactly?
<http://blog.8-p.info/2011/01/10/nosniff.html> makes it seem like text/plain sniffing only affects versions prior to Mac OS X 10.4.4.
Does 'X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff' get sent for the raw unified patch diff page? If not, we need to send it there, as well.

Sorry. The Windows version of Safari exhibited the behavior. I just verified that Safari on OS X 10.6.6 does not sniff for HTML.

For anyone curious, the latest version of Safari for Windows (5.0.3 (7533.19.4)) exhibits this content sniffing behavior.

Per our Bugzilla guideline, we never leave |if(| alone on its own line. Also, the big NOT condition is maybe not trivial to parse. What about this?
if ($action ne 'view'
&& ($action !~ /^(?:inter)?diff$/) || $cgi->param('format') ne 'raw'))
{
This looks simpler to me.

IMO, we should use $cgi->url to get arguments passed with the URL, or even better: $cgi->canonicalise\_query so that we can remove credentials if they are passed to the script. Unrelated arguments do not hurt, so that's fine if we pass them when redirecting.
>+sub view {

With what I said above, the 2nd argument would be useless; same with other calls to getAttachment() (which we should rename to get\_attachment()).
Otherwise, I'm fine with the logic of your patch.

You must also skip 't' (token), else reload a private attachment triggers an endless loop.

You must also pass $field\_name here.

Same here.
This summaries what I said on IRC. Maybe I said something more on IRC and forgot to report it here. But glob already has all the information. :)

$cgi->param('format') is not always defined, and so we get tons of
"Use of uninitialized value in string ne at attachment.cgi line 80."
To fix the problem, please add:
my $format = $cgi->param('format') || '';
right below "my $action", and use it in the if() condition.

Nit: /g is useless as this can happen only once.
Note that your patch makes interdiff() trigger [bug 631846](/show_bug.cgi?id=631846 "NEW - Throw*Error() should make sure the error is not displayed from the alternate attachment host"), but I suppose we can live with it.
r=LpSolit for 4.1.3 with the fix above (about 'format'). I haven't tested it against 4.0 and 3.6 yet (the patch applies cleanly, though).

patch v5
Hum, there is one testcase which fails with your patch:
If the interdiff is made against a private patch and a public patch in a public bug, and newid points to the private patch and oldid to the public patch, then an error is thrown when you click "Raw Unified":
"Sorry, you are not authorized to access this attachment."
This is because get\_attachment('oldid') redirects us to the alternate host, and when validateID('newid') is called, Bugzilla is unable to check that the user is in the insidergroup to let him view the private attachment.
I suppose switching both lines will fix the problem, without introducing new regressions.

For 3.6.6 and above, please add attach\_id => $attachment->id to ThrowUserError('auth\_failure') in check\_can\_access() to get the exact attachment ID when something goes wrong. Else it's a pain to understand what's wrong. Do not add this to 3.4.12; this version doesn't support the attachment ID in the error message.Flags: blocking3.6.6+Flags: blocking3.6.5+Flags: blocking3.4.12+Flags: blocking3.4.11+

patch v6

As said in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=637981#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] \"Raw Unified\" patch diffs can cause XSS on this domain in IE 6-8 and Safari"), $cgi->param('format') is not always defined. Please use the fix I proposed in [comment 22](/show_bug.cgi?id=637981#c22 "RESOLVED FIXED - [SECURITY] \"Raw Unified\" patch diffs can cause XSS on this domain in IE 6-8 and Safari").

This code is useless. We will populate the hash once attachments are validated.

Redirecting to urlbase if bug IDs do not match doesn't make sense. What do we expect after the redirect? An error must be thrown instead. I would prefer something like this:
$attachments{$\_} = validateID($\_, 1) foreach @field\_names;
if (scalar(@field\_names) > 1
&& $attachments{oldid}->bug\_id != $attachments{newid}->id)
{
ThrowUserError('attachment\_bug\_id\_mismatch');
}
Add 'attachment\_bug\_id\_mismatch' to global/user-error.html.tmpl if there is no equivalent yet.
>+ foreach my $field\_name (sort keys %attachments) {
>+ $path .= $field\_name . '=' . $attachments{$field\_name}->id . '&';
>+ }
No need to sort the list. Also, please use @field\_names instead of |keys %attachments|. Also, to avoid the trailing &, this should be written as:
my @args = map { $\_ . '=' . $attachments{$\_}->id } @field\_names;
$path .= join('&', @args);
>+ $path =~ s/&$//g;
This is now useless with my proposal above.
>+ if (all\_attachments\_are\_public(%attachments)) {
Pass stuff by reference, not by value, to avoid data being copied again and again.

Same here.

use @field\_names.

>+ my @result;
>+ foreach my $field\_name (@field\_names) {
>+ push @result, $attachments{$field\_name};
>+ }
>+ return @result;
>+ } else {
>+ return $attachments{$field\_names[0]};
>+ }
This is too complex. Simply write:
return values %attachments;
>+sub pack\_token\_data {
>+ my %attachments = @\_;
>+ my @token\_data;
>+ foreach my $field\_name (keys %attachments) {
>+ push @token\_data, $field\_name;

>+ }
>+ return join(' ', @token\_data);

Simpler to write:
return join(' ', map { $\_ . '=' . $attachments{$\_}->id } keys %$attachments);
(note that I prefer the foo=bar syntax)
>+sub unpack\_token\_data {
>+ my @token\_data = split(/ /, shift);
>+ my %attachments;
>+ while (@token\_data) {
>+ my $field\_name = shift @token\_data;

Do not name the hash %attachments; that's confusing (and in fact doesn't contain any attachment object). Also, it would be simpler to write:
my @token\_data = split(/ /, shift);
my %data;
foreach my $token (@token\_data) {
my ($field\_name, $attach\_id) = split('=', $token);
$data{$field\_name} = $attach\_id;
}
I haven't tested this patch.

that won't work as the values need to be returned in @field\_names order, and we need wantarray otherwise we'll return 1 to most calls.
i'll use:
return wantarray
? map { $attachments{$\_} } @field\_names
: $attachments{$field\_names[0]};

Redirecting to urlbase when you get an invalid token makes sense, because this will generate a new and valid token. But when both attachments belong to different bugs, redirecting to urlbase won't make them belong to the same bug. :)

>+ push @args, $cgi->canonicalise\_query(@field\_names, 't', 'Bugzilla\_login', 'Bugzilla\_password');
Only push if we have something to push, else the URL ends with a trailing &. For instance, write:
my $cgi\_params = $cgi->canonicalise\_query(@field\_names, 't', 'Bugzilla\_login', 'Bugzilla\_password');
push(@args, $cgi\_params) if $cgi\_params;
>+ if (!all\_attachments\_are\_public(\%attachments)) {
>+ my ($userid, undef, $token\_data) = Bugzilla::Token::GetTokenData($token);
>+ my %token\_data = unpack\_token\_data($token\_data);
If no token is passed, unpack\_token\_data() complains that $token\_data is undefined:
"attachment.cgi: Use of uninitialized value in split at /var/www/html/bugzilla/attachment.cgi line 350."
That's the reason of my r-.
>+sub pack\_token\_data {

Please explicitly return $r.

"operation" is singular, not plural.
Your patch works fine in all my testcases. Fix the few problems above, and we are good to go.

Apple fixed the issue in Safari 5.1, which they released recently. See [CVE-2010-1420](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-1420) or <http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4808>.

Note that this won't be a problem on Safari anymore once [bug 243764](/show_bug.cgi?id=243764 "RESOLVED FIXED - Trailing slashes cause unexpected errors") is fixed. /test.html will be trimmed.
