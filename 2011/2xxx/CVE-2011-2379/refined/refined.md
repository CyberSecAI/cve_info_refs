Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way Bugzilla handles "Raw Unified" patch diffs. When a patch file is uploaded as an attachment and viewed in "Raw Unified" mode, Bugzilla serves it with a `Content-type: text/plain` header. However, older versions of Internet Explorer (6-8) and Safari (before 5.0.6) perform "content sniffing". This means that even though the server specifies the content as `text/plain`, these browsers will try to detect if the content is actually HTML. If the "patch" contains HTML, they parse and render it as HTML allowing execution of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Content Sniffing Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the browsers' (IE and Safari) content sniffing behavior, which overrides the server-specified content type.
- **Lack of X-Content-Type-Options header:** The server does not send `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header for raw unified patch diffs. This header instructs the browser not to perform content sniffing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker can upload a malicious patch file containing JavaScript code, and when a user views this "patch" in "Raw Unified" mode using a vulnerable browser, the JavaScript will execute within the context of the Bugzilla domain. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Code Execution:** The attacker can inject malicious code in the context of the Bugzilla web application allowing complete control of the application within the scope of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Patch Upload:** The attacker uploads a specially crafted patch file as an attachment to a bug report.
- **Viewing Raw Unified Diffs:** A user clicks on the "Diff" link for the malicious patch, then selects "Raw Unified" mode. This triggers the vulnerability in vulnerable browsers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Bugzilla User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the Bugzilla instance, able to create or modify bug reports.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to know about the content sniffing behavior of specific browsers and how to exploit it.
- **No direct network access needed:** The attacker does not need to have direct access to the server hosting Bugzilla; they only need to exploit the web application.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the alternate host for attachments is used when viewing patches in "Raw Unified" mode and by adding `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to the response. This prevents the vulnerable browsers from sniffing the content as HTML.

**Additional Details (from the bugzilla entry):**
- Safari on Windows also exhibited this behavior. The issue was fixed in Safari 5.1 and above.
- The bug affected Bugzilla back to version 2.10.
- The fix was implemented in Bugzilla versions 3.4.12, 3.6.6, 4.0.2, and 4.1.3.
- The bug is publicly visible.
