## Error description

* ```
  OutputMediators are responsible for serializing a Portal URL.
  They can depend on the request and response.
  The implementation design is to re-use the mediators but only
  use one mediator per thread (and request).
  The problem is that the references to the request and response
  were not cleaned up at the end of a request.
