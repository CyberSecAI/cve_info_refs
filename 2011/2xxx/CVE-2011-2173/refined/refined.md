Based on the provided information, this content is related to a memory leak vulnerability, but not to the specific CVE-2011-2173. The content describes a fix for APAR PM33432, which addresses an out-of-memory error caused by `OutputMediator` objects not releasing references to request and response objects in IBM WebSphere Portal.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- `OutputMediator` objects, responsible for serializing Portal URLs, were not clearing references to the request and response objects after each request. This led to a memory leak as these objects were being held onto unnecessarily.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory leak due to improper resource management. The `OutputMediator` objects were designed to be reused per thread but were not releasing references to request/response objects after a request completes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Out-of-memory errors due to the memory leak, potentially causing service disruption.
- The system might become unstable or unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by normal portal requests, no specific attack vector is described. The memory leak occurs when the system is used normally.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No specific attacker is needed. The vulnerability exists in the product itself, and it is triggered by normal usage.
- Any user generating portal requests will cause the memory leak.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves clearing the references to request and response objects within the `OutputMediator` instances at the end of the requests.
- The affected versions are IBM WebSphere Portal 6.0.1.7.
- Fixes are available in fix packs and combined cumulative fixes for versions 6.1.0.6, 7.0.0.2, 7.0.0.1 & 7.0.0.2.
