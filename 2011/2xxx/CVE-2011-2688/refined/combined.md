How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

keep it here for history and reference.

Here are some things I have made in Arexx (on Amiga):

<MRENFIX_1.0a.lha>
[Readme](MRENFIX_1.0a_readme.html) (change prefix and suffix of files)

<XPKTEST_2.1.lha>
[Readme](XPKTEST_2.1_readme.html) (test XPK libraries)

And here are some things I made on a DOS/Windows PC:

<4MP.zip>
[Readme](4MP_readme.html) (use L3ENC, the MP3 encoder, with wildcards)

<BGSEQ.zip>
[Readme](BGSEQ_readme.html) (automatically change your background wallpaper in Windoze)

<L3P.zip>
[Readme](L3P_readme.html) (4DOS script for reading cd audio and encoding mp3 streams)

And some UN\*X thangs:

<chosts.gz> (v1.1, Check which UNIX hosts in your domain

[Scripts](/epic/) that I have written for the ircII EPIC
client.

[Make Picture Index](mpi.gz), a shellscript to generate web page indexes
for pictures w/thumbs.

<pcomp.gz>, a shellscript to compare what versions of
the packages installed on a FreeBSD system is available in the ports
collection. IMHO, very handy to spot which packages might need an
upgrade.

[Gnokline](gnokline-1.0.tgz) [README](gnokline-1.0_README), a program to manage incoming SMS messages to a Nokia mobile phone permanently connected to a PC with gnokii installed, executing programs according to commands in the SMS'es if supplied password and the sending number is correct -- in the purpose of connecting your home network to the Internet remotely.

[MySQL-auth](mysql-auth-1.0b.pl.gz), a Perl script to authenticate users against a MySQL database.

[Bounceweb](bounceweb-1.1.tgz), a Perl based solution for approving of bounced Majordomo messages: webinterface, CLI admin tools, etc.

Oh, $DEITY, you are absolutely right, I looked at a locally patched
version and confused it with the debian provided one. I had too little
coffee yesterday :)

Yes, this bug should be reopened, and fixed.

Vulnerability  : SQL injection
Problem type   : remote
Debian-specific: no
CVE ID         : CVE-2011-2688
Debian Bug     : 633637

It was discovered that libapache2-mod-authnz-external, an apache
authentication module, is prone to an SQL injection via the $user
paramter.

For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.4-2+squeeze1.

The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain
libapache2-mod-authnz-external

For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.

For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.4-2.1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-authnz-external packages.
