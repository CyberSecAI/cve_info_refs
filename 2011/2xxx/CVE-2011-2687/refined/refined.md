Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2011-2687:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from node listings within Drupal 7 that do not properly join the node table. This omission leads to the exposure of all nodes, irrespective of the access restrictions defined by the `node_access` system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Access Control Bypass:** The core issue is an access control bypass. Due to the missing JOIN operation, the system fails to enforce access restrictions, allowing unauthorized users to view content that should be restricted to specific roles or users.
- **Incomplete Query Logic:** The vulnerability is due to the incomplete query logic that fails to consider the node access permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to view all nodes within the system, including private or restricted content, which could lead to exposure of sensitive data.
- **Bypass of Intended Access Controls:** The intended access controls of the Drupal system are bypassed, undermining the security model.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access to Node Listings:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable node listings (e.g., taxonomy listings or forum listings) that do not enforce the `node_access` system.
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web interface of the affected Drupal installations, by accessing vulnerable pages

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the Drupal instance.
- **No Authentication Required (Potentially):**  The nature of the vulnerability does not require the attacker to authenticate, allowing anonymous users to potentially view restricted content.

**Affected Versions:**
- Drupal 7.0
- Drupal 7.1
- Drupal 7.2

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in Drupal 7.4, upgrading to this version will resolve the issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects core Drupal subsystems like taxonomy and forum.
- The issue was identified as a high-risk security vulnerability.
