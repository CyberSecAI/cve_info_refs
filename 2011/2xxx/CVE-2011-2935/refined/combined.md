CVE Request: Elgg 1.7.10 <= | Multiple Vulnerabilities

YGN Ethical Hacker Group
2011-08-18 06:18:27 UTC

[Permalink](https://narkive.com/1UH3NYx8.1)
1. OVERVIEW

The Elgg 1.7.10 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site
Scripting and SQL Injection.

2. BACKGROUND

Elgg is an award-winning social networking engine, delivering the
building blocks that enable businesses, schools, universities and
associations to create their own fully-featured social networks and
applications. Well-known Organizations with networks powered by Elgg
include: Australian Government, British Government, Federal Canadian
Government, MITRE, The World Bank, UNESCO, NASA, Stanford University,
Johns Hopkins University and more (http://elgg.org/powering.php)

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

attacker to conduct Cross Site Scripting attack. This may allow an
attacker to create a specially crafted URL that would execute
arbitrary script code in a victim's browser. The "tag\_names" is not
properly sanitized, which allows attacker to conduct SQL Injection
attack.

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

- Cross Site Scripting

http://localhost/pg/embed/media?internalname=%20%22onmouseover=%22alert%28/XSS/%29%22style=%22width:3000px!important;height:3000px!important;z-index:999999;position:absolute!important;left:0;top:0;%22%20x=%22

  Description     : PHP-based social networking framework

 Elgg is a PHP-based social networking application that uses the latest in
 Web 2.0 trends and environments.  It allows the quick and easy creation
 of full-featured social networks, but remains highly configurable through
 modular plugin, theming, and widget systems.  Many third party plugins
 further extend functionality and can be downloaded and installed from the
 community site at <http://community.elgg.org>.
 .
 By default, Elgg supports:
 *  A full featured profile system that includes drag-and-drop profile editing.
 *  A micro-blogging widget similar to Twitter.
 *  Site-wide groups.
 *  A comprehensive activity stream that provides an immediate overview
 of users', groups', and the site's actions.
 *  A content-reporting tool to allow users to report inappropriate content.
 *  A user-customizable dashboard that allows easy access to often-used tools.
 .
 Optional core plugins include:
 *  A full featured blogging system with auto-save drafts, and preview modes.
 *  A files system to allow users to store photos, documents, and videos.
 *  TinyMCE HTML Editor with embedded media
 *  Message Board and internal messaging system
 *  Twitter integration

Hey Pablo,

I have since taken over as the lead developer for Elgg and so haven't
had much time to package for Debian.  The initial RFS thread on
debian-mentors can be found here [1] along with some discussion.
Unfortunately--at least at the time I was doing this--there was very
little official policy in place for PHP applications, so it involved a
lot of guesswork and copying from other PHP packages.  I believe in
this case it might be worthwhile to find a mentor who has sponsored a
PHP package before.  If you would like to take over trying to get this
in Debian, send me a private email and we'll talk more. :)

Thanks,
Brett

retitle 526197 RFP: elgg -- PHP-based social networking framework
noowner 526197
thanks

Hi,

This is an automatic email to change the status of elgg back from ITP
(Intent to Package) to RFP (Request for Package), because this bug hasn't seen
any activity during the last 6 months.

If you are still interested in adopting elgg, please send a mail to
<control@bugs.debian.org> with:

 retitle 526197 ITP: elgg -- PHP-based social networking framework
 owner 526197 !
 thanks

However, it is not recommended to keep ITP for a long time without acting on
the package, as it might cause other prospective maintainers to refrain from
packaging that software. It is also a good idea to document your progress on
this ITP from time to time, by mailing <526197@bugs.debian.org>.

Thank you for your interest in Debian,
--
Lucas, for the QA team <debian-qa@lists.debian.org>

CVE Request: Elgg 1.7.10 <= | Multiple Vulnerabilities

YGN Ethical Hacker Group
2011-08-18 06:18:27 UTC

[Permalink](https://narkive.com/1UH3NYx8.1)
1. OVERVIEW

The Elgg 1.7.10 and lower versions are vulnerable to Cross Site
Scripting and SQL Injection.

2. BACKGROUND

Elgg is an award-winning social networking engine, delivering the
building blocks that enable businesses, schools, universities and
associations to create their own fully-featured social networks and
applications. Well-known Organizations with networks powered by Elgg
include: Australian Government, British Government, Federal Canadian
Government, MITRE, The World Bank, UNESCO, NASA, Stanford University,
Johns Hopkins University and more (http://elgg.org/powering.php)

3. VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

The "internalname" parameter is not properly sanitized, which allows
attacker to conduct Cross Site Scripting attack. This may allow an
attacker to create a specially crafted URL that would execute
arbitrary script code in a victim's browser. The "tag\_names" is not
properly sanitized, which allows attacker to conduct SQL Injection
attack.

4. VERSIONS AFFECTED

Elgg 1.7.10 <=

5. PROOF-OF-CONCEPT/EXPLOIT

- Cross Site Scripting

http://localhost/pg/embed/media?internalname=%20%22onmouseover=%22alert%28/XSS/%29%22style=%22width:3000px!important;height:3000px!important;z-index:999999;position:absolute!important;left:0;top:0;%22%20x=%22

- SQL Injection > Info Disclosure

### [repology/repology-rs](/repology/repology-rs)[*CVE* display limited to 200](/repology/repology-rs/issues/70)

... there shouldn t be a limit at
all. Perhaps implement pages where the user can show records *201* .. 400, 401 .. 600, etc. Right now it seem to show the
oldest 200, truncating new *cves*.
Needs triage
