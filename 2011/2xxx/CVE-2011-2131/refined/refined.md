Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2011-2131:

**Verification:**

The content from `securityreason.com` and `www.us-cert.gov` explicitly mentions CVE-2011-2131 and relates to a vulnerability in Adobe Photoshop CS5. The US-CERT advisory also points to Adobe Security Bulletin APSB11-22, which confirms the relevance.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an invalid value being crafted for the `ushort ImageHeight` field within a GIF file.
*   **Weakness:** This incorrect height value leads to memory corruption during the processing of the GIF file in Adobe Photoshop.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. This could lead to complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the target system.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector involves a crafted GIF file. The attacker must entice a user to open this malicious GIF file using Adobe Photoshop CS5.
*  **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker can be remote and does not require authentication to exploit the vulnerability. The complexity of attack is rated as medium, suggesting some level of skill or preparation is needed for a successful attack.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Adobe Photoshop CS5 (versions 12.0 and 12.1).
*   The vulnerability is triggered when Adobe Photoshop processes the maliciously crafted GIF file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The `securityreason.com` content provides links to proof-of-concept (PoC) code.
*   The US-CERT advisory references multiple Adobe security bulletins, indicating that CVE-2011-2131 is one of several vulnerabilities addressed in a series of Adobe updates.

**Summary:**
CVE-2011-2131 is a remote code execution vulnerability in Adobe Photoshop CS5 that can be triggered by opening a malicious GIF file with a specially crafted `ImageHeight` field, leading to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
