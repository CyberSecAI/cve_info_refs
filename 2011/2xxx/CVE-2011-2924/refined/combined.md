# foomatic-filters 4.0.12-1 source package in Ubuntu

## Changelog

```
foomatic-filters (4.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Till Kamppeter ]
  * New upstream release
     - If incoming PDF needs to be converted to PostScript
       due to the filter command line not being a standard Ghostscript
       command line, no separate PDF command line being supplied, or
       options in the PPD being implemented by PostScript code, use
       preferrably Ghostscript (with the "ps2write" device) for this
       conversion as Ghostscript is better optimized for printing and
       has a more sophisticated color management compared to Poppler.
     - SECURITY FIX: Use the mktemp shell command/mkstemp() function to create
       the debug log file and the renderer input data file (both files only
       generated when foomatic-rip is un in debug mode) with file names with an
       unpredictable part. The names are /tmp/foomatic-rip-XXXXXX.log and
       /tmp/foomatic-rip-YYYYYY.ps where the XXXXXX and YYYYYY are replaced by
       random strings. Thanks to Tim Waugh from Red Hat for for the patch
       (Upstream bug #936, CVE-2011-2924).
  * debian/patches/use-ghostscript-for-pdf-to-ps.patch: Removed, merged
    upstream.

[foomatic-filters](/ubuntu/precise/%2Bpackage/foomatic-filters):
OpenPrinting printer support - filters

Foomatic is a printer database designed to make it easier to set up

 common printers for use with UNIX-like operating systems.

 It provides the "glue" between a print spooler (like CUPS or lpr) and

 the printer, by processing files sent to the printer.

 .

 This package consists of filters used by the printer spoolers

 to convert the incoming PostScript data into the printer's native

 format using a printer-specific, but spooler-independent PPD file.

 .

 For use with CUPS, you will need both the cups and cups-client

 packages installed on your system.

### [SSSD: System Security Services Daemon](/Articles/457415/)

September 27, 2011

This article was contributed by Marko Myllynen

Centralized identity and authentication management offers several
benefits over the ancient "solution" of spreading password files across
all the systems of an organization. User information can be added,
modified, and deleted in one central location and the change is
effective everywhere instantly. Most commonly in today's environments
user identity and authentication functions are carried out with [LDAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol)
and [Kerberos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_%28protocol%29)-based solutions. [SSSD](https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/), the
System Security Services Daemon, is a fairly recent client-side
all-in-one component which aims to bring together all the features
previously available only in several separate components while adding
new ones and providing increased flexibility and robustness.

Linux client-side configuration for centralized
identity and authentication stores with caching and offline support has
traditionally
required configuration of several independent components; the end result
and operational efficiency has not always been optimal. Offline support
means that previously logged-in users' password hashes and identity
information are stored locally so that all operations requiring
authentication or UID to username mapping can be processed locally.

Let us
consider the components in a typical case where LDAP and
Kerberos are used for identity and authentication and there are mobile
users who roam around with their laptops between different networks.
First, nss\_ldap has to be configured to retrieve the user
identity information from LDAP. Then pam\_krb5 needs to be
configured to allow for user authentication. Alas, neither of these
components supports caching or offline mode. So nscd needs
to be configured to cache user information. And then finally
pam\_ccreds is needed for caching authentication credentials
while offline. Most readers would probably agree that this scheme
isn't the most efficient and robust solution so there may be
some room for improvement.
#### What SSSD does

SSSD provides several features but the most important is to provide
access to identity and authentication resources through a common
framework that can provide caching and offline support to the system.
For offline support SSSD keeps the credentials
in a local cache. When a user logs in to an organization's network with
their centrally managed account on their laptop, the user information and
credentials are automatically stored in the SSSD cache.

Secondly, it supports queries to multiple servers. Thus, one can
query a number of different user databases. Third, the daemon has its
own NSS and PAM interfaces for use by client systems. From
a performance point of view, this offers advantages. Instead of needing to
set up a connection for each and every application that queries the NSS
LDAP database, only a single socket from SSSD to the LDAP server is
required. And all these features can be configured in a single
configuration file.

For users, authentication and Kerberos tickets will then work in a
straightforward way: when logging in while online (i.e., a connection
to the central user account service can be made), a user enters their
username and password and, once verified, a Kerberos ticket for the user is automatically acquired. A
successful online login also refreshes the user's cache entry without
any manual steps.

When logging in while offline, authentication is
done against the cached information. When SSSD observes that the
system is online again (e.g., after the user has established a VPN
connection), it can [acquire a Kerberos ticket for the user in the
background](http://sgallagh.wordpress.com/2011/09/02/sssd-tips-and-tricks-vol-1-kerberos/) without any additional effort by the user. Kerberos
tickets can be also be automatically renewed based on the SSSD configuration.
If an organization has implemented single sign-on (SSO) using Kerberos
then SSSD helps to provide very smooth but secure user experience.

In practical terms, SSSD has one central configuration file,
/etc/sssd/sssd.conf, which contains all the configuration options
needed for one or several domains, possibly with different retention
policies for each domain. NSS and PAM are configured to use the
SSSD modules, libnss\_sss.so and pam\_sss.so,
respectively, and the sssd service needs to be enabled. Distributions
like Fedora and RHEL have also integrated SSSD as part of their
authconfig tool used to configure user information sources removing the
need for manually editing NSS or PAM configuration files (also providing
basic configuration for sssd.conf).

It should be noted that, in addition
to sssd.conf, /etc/krb5.conf needs to be
configured when using Kerberos for authentication. That is also
required for applications and utilities using the Kerberos libraries
directly. The manual page [sssd.conf(5)](http://linuxmanpages.net/manpages/fedora15/man5/sssd.conf.5.html) provides a
comprehensive overview of the available configuration options and [Fedora
SSSD Guide](http://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/15/html/Deployment_Guide/chap-SSSD_User_Guide-Setting_Up_SSSD.html) offers a complete walk-through for setting up SSSD.

In addition to identity and authentication methods like LDAP and
Kerberos, SSSD also includes support for netgroups and proxied
authentication (for example to be used with NIS, since a native NIS backend is not
yet available, although it is in the roadmap). These might be helpful features for
organizations during a transition when moving from NIS to
LDAP/Kerberos. Another interesting feature is host-based access
control (HBAC) using FreeIPA. HBAC rules can be used to control which
users or groups can access a specific host.
#### Past and future

SSSD can trace its origins to the [FreeIPA](http://freeipa.org/) project. The SSSD project,
originally codenamed "Bluebox" for reasons lost to history, was
envisioned as the FreeIPA's primary client component. As SSSD began to
take shape, it was realized that many of the enhancements that were
being developed to support FreeIPA would also be valuable for users of
other LDAP and Kerberos environments. Thus the long-term vision for SSSD
was revised and it became a project in its own right, related to FreeIPA,
but distinct. Since its introduction in Fedora 11,
SSSD's user and developer community has grown rapidly. It is now available
for
all major distributions (Fedora, Ubuntu, RHEL, openSUSE, and others) and
there are already some large enterprises which have already deployed it
globally as part of their Linux installations.

Several notable new features are in the [roadmap](https://fedorahosted.org/sssd/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&group=milestone&type=enhancement&order=priority). Work is going on to use
sudo's plugin interface in SSSD to make it easier
to maintain centralized sudo rules that also function while offline.
Another planned addition is automounter integration which would allow
SSSD to retrieve LDAP served automount maps for autofs. Enhanced Active
Directory integration and D-Bus based interfaces for extended user
information and data are also coming.
There are other interesting features planned for SSSD
— additional
suggestions and participation from the community is warmly welcomed.

The use of the SSSD offers many benefits,
especially for administrators and mobile users. Instead of having multiple
accounts, users can simply use a single account. Kerberos tickets can
be automatically acquired and renewed, which makes the use of "kerberized"
services
seamless but secure. Offline mode can also be useful in data centers to help
bridge the gap caused by a temporary failure of the LDAP or Kerberos
servers. Compared with older solutions, SSSD offers far more
flexible management and simplified administration for client-side identity
and authentication needs.

## Brief items

### [Quote of the week](/Articles/460627/)

So, it's no wonder that hackers can just plug something new in and
nobody notices. As long as it doesn't infect five million
residential banking customers then nobody is going have a
description of the suspect. That is the reality of hacking today,
and it has nothing to do with advanced persistent threat. It has to
do with the enterprise and the complete LACK of control you have
over the endpoint. When security is limited to the network
perimeter, you are not in control. Oh, and what a breath of fresh
air the mobile device is. A new pile of software, mostly social
media, that is directly connected to thousands of strangers that
are not your employees, communicating in real-time with processes
running within your defensive wall. In effect, you now have
thousands of potential multi-homed routers to 3G-space from your
network that don't belong to you.

### [Garrett: Supporting UEFI secure boot on Linux: the details](/Articles/460293/)

Matthew Garrett [continues
looking](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/6054.html) into the UEFI secure boot feature. "Summary: We don't really support secure boot right now, but that's ok because you can't buy any hardware that supports it yet. Adding support is probably about a week's worth of effort at most."

### [Garrett: UEFI secure booting (part 2)](/Articles/460199/)

Here's [a second installment
from Matthew Garrett](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/5850.html) on the UEFI secure boot feature. "Microsoft
have responded to suggestions that Windows 8 may make it difficult to boot
alternative operating systems. What's interesting is that at no point do
they contradict anything I've said. As things stand, Windows 8 certified
systems will make it either more difficult or impossible to install
alternative operating systems. But let's have some more background."

### [MySQL.com Hacked to Serve Malware (PC World)](/Articles/460559/)

PC World [reports](https://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/240609/mysqlcom_hacked_to_serve_malware.html)
that the MySQL.com site has been compromised. "Hackers had installed
JavaScript code that threw a variety of known browser attacks at visitors
to the site, so those with out-of-date browsers or unpatched versions of
Adobe Flash, Reader or Java on their Windows PCs could have been quietly
infected with malicious software."

### [Mozilla and Tor on the TLS attack](/Articles/460662/)

Messages have appeared on [the
Mozilla security blog](https://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/09/27/attack-against-tls-protected-communications/) and [the Tor
project blog](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-and-beast-ssl-attack) regarding the recently-disclosed attack against
TLS 1.0. The summary is: neither the Firefox browser nor the Tor
service is vulnerable. The Tor post has a lot of information about how the
attack works and why they are not worried about it. Mozilla, instead, says
that some Java plugins may be vulnerable and that Java should be disabled.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=726426#c0)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-28 14:49:45 UTC  ``` It was found that foomatic-rip filter used insecurely created temporary file for storage of PostScript data by rendering the data, intended to be sent to the PostScript filter, when the debug mode was enabled. A local attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks (overwrite arbitrary file accessible with the privileges of the user running the foomatic-rip universal print filter).  Relevant source code part (Perl script part / foomatic-rip.in): ===============================================================    100 my $logfile = "/tmp/foomatic-rip";   ..   3454 # In debug mode save the data supposed to be fed into the   3455 # renderer also into a file   3456 if ($debug) {   3457   $commandline = "tee -a ${logfile}.ps | ( $commandline )";   3458 }  Note: The $logfile variable declaration (line #100) is not an insecure       temporary file use issue itself, since this danger (and its proper       usage) is documented in /etc/foomatic/filters.conf file.  Relevant source code part (C script part / renderer.c): ========================================================    436  /* Save the data supposed to be fed into the renderer            also int        o a file*/    437  dstrprepend(commandline, "tee -a " LOG_FILE ".ps | ( ");    438  dstrcat(commandline, ")");    439  }  Note: The LOG_FILE variable declaration by itself is not an insecure       temporary file use, since this danger (and its proper usage)       is documented in /etc/foomatic/filters.conf file.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=726426#c1)  Jan Lieskovsky    2011-07-28 14:53:14 UTC  ``` This issue affects the versions of the foomatic package, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6.  --  This issue affects the versions of the foomatic package, as shipped with Fedora release of 14 and 15.
