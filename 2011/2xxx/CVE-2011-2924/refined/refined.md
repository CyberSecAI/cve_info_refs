{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The foomatic-rip filter, when run in debug mode, creates temporary files with predictable names in /tmp.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure temporary file creation. The foomatic-rip filter uses fixed file names in /tmp for debug logging and renderer input data when debug mode is enabled.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting symlink attacks, overwriting arbitrary files accessible with the privileges of the user running the foomatic-rip filter.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a local user on the system and have the ability to trigger the foomatic-rip filter with debug mode enabled."
